$670k is the median 2 bedroom price in my neighborhood, but the market is slowing. Recent sales have the closing price 25% less than the asking price on average
$699.999
$7 for me is $7 for you*. Sorry I forgot to explain the acronym
$7.2m cap hit this year, $8m next year
$7.8m > $260k. Facts. 
$7m
$8 eggs and chiefs/eagles 
$8.99/month to stream the greatest football player who has ever lived is a steal 
$82 for BC/Rutgers. Damn 
$89*
$99/year 
$9ish a cocktail though, $15 for flights of three, so it’s expensive but worth it if you’re into that sort of thing 
$XXX,XXX.00 instead of $XXX,XXX.00

@#FireAddazio Can you post the past picks for the survivor pool?
@#FireAddazio Could you please post the picture of the survivor league picks. I'm surprisingly unable to remember who I have picked in weeks past.
@#FireAddazio Has been liking my posts. Pretty sure he's awake 
@#FireAddazio Looks like AP is out for 3-4 months. That's too bad. Looks like you need a running back. I'll trade you Kenyan Drake for Amari Cooper. Seems like a great deal right there 
@#FireAddazio Marcus was supposed to meet me at WMed to bring back their coach. Fucking blame him. Not me. He ditched me at VT today today 
@#FireAddazio You never responded to Benitendi being added to the 🐐 list 
@#JoeBourqueLies had particularly good games from his three saints played too 
@#JoeBourqueLies You wouldn't still want to trade me Cooks for Booker, would you?

@#JustFacts✅  here is the tl;dr from Snopes: In a now-deleted Facebook post, Greene suggested that laser beams from space may have started the 2018 California wildfires, and that among the entities behind this conspiracy were former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Rothschild Inc., an investment firm frequently targeted by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists. Greene did not explicitly state that “Jewish lasers” caused the fires.
@#JustFacts✅  hi

@#JustFacts✅  I dropped several things loudly onto the floor and turned the back hallway light off on on my neighbor today. I am definitely winning this
@#JustFacts✅  I had the same opinion on Richard's character arc
@#JustFacts✅  I in no way knew this, I had to look it up. "Indeed, the logo was inspired by 19th century minstrel celebrating the "mammy," a black woman content to serve her white masters. A former slave, Nancy Green, became the first face of the pancake product in 1890."
@#JustFacts✅  I thought of you less of a coworker and more of a trainee
@#JustFacts✅  I want to apologize that I took words out of context in the heat of the moment.
@#JustFacts✅  I was just about to say that I appreciated our spirited debate and that I appreciated you help ground me in the possible positive news going on around me, including interesting research articles, and that I appreciated you as a friend and person but I can't now because you're too fired up
@#JustFacts✅  I will be there any minute. Will you wait for me outside the front door until I get there?
@#JustFacts✅  I will be there closer to 8
@#JustFacts✅  It won't be in an email

@#JustFacts✅  respond to my text
@#JustFacts✅  so 6:30 pm, confirmed time?
@#JustFacts✅  So what you're saying is that you can understand why someone would dislike a professional athlete due to the media's response to them as a player
@#JustFacts✅  summed up exactly how I feel on the kneeing issue.
@#JustFacts✅  tentatively 5/4 through 5/8. Might be shifting a few days in the latter direction
@#JustFacts✅  That would be what appears to be a San Francisco Giants player sliding into what looks like third base. Only he does not have his helmet anymore and his face is smashing painfully into the dirt. Also pictured are legs of an umpire and the opposing fielder.

@#JustFacts✅ great work on that play 
@#JustFacts✅ Guess who is at monument 
@#JustFacts✅ gunna take a victory lap right now 
@#JustFacts✅ has liked comments but hasn't answered the question 
@#JustFacts✅ has never been wrong 
@#JustFacts✅ have you ever known me to *not* be dramatic? 
@#JustFacts✅ He’s talking about you 
@#JustFacts✅ Hear anything from meaghann today? 
@#JustFacts✅ Her last post is confirmed to be from Dec 2016
@#JustFacts✅ he's gonna be too busy doing good research to shave his pubes for you
@#JustFacts✅ hey buddy. Just checking in to see how intern year is going 
@#JustFacts✅ Hey man, I noticed that you left Kenyon Drake on your bench
@#JustFacts✅ hi
@#JustFacts✅ Hi
@#JustFacts✅ High enough that you’d die if you jumped 
@#JustFacts✅ holding 
@#JustFacts✅ how are your goggles
@#JustFacts✅ How did Kristen's run go today? I take it from her snap story that she survived? 
@#JustFacts✅ How do we feel about Marco Sturm being named the Bruins head coach 
@#JustFacts✅ how do you think we feel about you
@#JustFacts✅ how does Ricky feel about slugs? 
@#JustFacts✅ how is the OS coming along? 
@#JustFacts✅ how is your day going
@#JustFacts✅ how many babies did you ruthlessly murder last night 
@#JustFacts✅ how many friendship bracelets have you gotten?
@#JustFacts✅ how many individual posts can a person make on Instagram in a single day before they break ASMB rules? 
@#JustFacts✅ how many public restrooms have you jerked it in? 
@#JustFacts✅ how much money you put on this game? 
@#JustFacts✅ how much of Kristen's water did you steal
@#JustFacts✅ how much of your bachelor party will revolve around acting out the whole trapped in the closet series 
@#JustFacts✅ how much Tufts med school attire should I wear this weekend? 
@#JustFacts✅ how was the sex? Everything you dreamed of for your first time?
@#JustFacts✅ how's the mogul life
@#JustFacts✅ I also saw Knives Out a week ago and it was the first movie I saw in theaters since the first reboot of the new Star wars trilogy 
@#JustFacts✅ I am going to a med school friends house tonight for a house warming party, otherwise I would take you up 
@#JustFacts✅ I can help make those student loans disappear 
@#JustFacts✅ I cannot make it
@#JustFacts✅ I could easily use photoshop too 
@#JustFacts✅ I didn't want any message I sent to the GroupMe to distract from the investigations at hand
@#JustFacts✅ I don't work until Thursday and am using this opportunity to drive back to Boston to sleep there. I may revisit the Airbnb question 
@#JustFacts✅ I enjoy making your flex spot happy 
@#JustFacts✅ I feel bad for Dan's dad 
@#JustFacts✅ I have a question that I legitimately don't know the answer to. When the vaccines were still being tested, the dogma was that even if you were vaccinated, you could still be infected (just protected from serious complications) and pass along the virus to others. If that's the case, I personally would not feel comfortably possibly exposing others, but that is my personal choice. 
@#JustFacts✅ I have a trivia question for you. What’s worse than being a skimmer? 
@#JustFacts✅ I have my final OSCE in a week and my final exam for “first semester” a week from tomorrow 
@#JustFacts✅ I hear you're enjoying Crabtree in your flex spot. I am enjoying Derek Carr in my lineup. Our bond shall lead us both to victory 
@#JustFacts✅ I hope you bet all your money on BC not covering the spread. Serves you right for doubting BC 
@#JustFacts✅ I hope you'll still be at work when I get home 
@#JustFacts✅ I kept posting, just blocked you. 
@#JustFacts✅ I miss our lobster wok dates
@#JustFacts✅ I need a sad bitmoji right now 
@#JustFacts✅ I responded to kovin 
@#JustFacts✅ I see you've already completed your waiver, despite saying you were waiting til the last minute on Saturday 
@#JustFacts✅ I thought we decided that the answer was "no" 
@#JustFacts✅ I totally burned you worse than Joe trying to reheat pizza 
@#JustFacts✅ I was driving home from Western mass and listening on the radio. No JJ watt circle jerk there 
@#JustFacts✅ I watched the deposition episode and the dinner party. Season 4 by the way 
@#JustFacts✅ I wouldn't disown you as a friend if you went. Since we know that's what you care about 
@#JustFacts✅ I'll come back when I want to come back 
@#JustFacts✅ I'm gonna go ahead and add Devin to the bachelor party GroupMe. Hope that's cool 
@#JustFacts✅ I'm sorry that some haters and losers where upset with you that you moved back into a home that you and your lovely wife own in a different city to pursue your dream job
@#JustFacts✅ I'm sorry that you're being attacked in this way. You don't deserve it 
@#JustFacts✅ I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Not only are we replaced, but he found a new Becks
@#JustFacts✅ I'm starting to get a little more worried about June
@#JustFacts✅ I'm transporting a patient to BCH. You want to come into work and meet me? 
@#JustFacts✅ In all seriousness, it is a girl our age who works with Winslow at Babson. For some odd reason, she wants to move into the city and deal with street parking. She's next in line (or so it sounds) to be sent to the police academy and is getting her masters at NEU
@#JustFacts✅ inject that salt right into @Jordan Kelleher's veins 
@#JustFacts✅ intrinsically, no. The restaurants that I have seen offer it do not do gf or do not list it on their gf menu 
@#JustFacts✅ is @Pet 🪨 still mad at you? 
@#JustFacts✅ is a real fan 
@#JustFacts✅ is a really good signing 
@#JustFacts✅ is it too late for me (not Olivia) to get in on dinner tomorrow night? 
@#JustFacts✅ is Ricky excited to see me this weekend? 
@#JustFacts✅ is supporting a proven cheater 
@#JustFacts✅ is the only responsible one on that trip 
@#JustFacts✅ Is your coworker Portuguese? The area is very heavily populated by people of Portuguese descent 
@#JustFacts✅ it was great spending time with you last night. Glad I could carve time out of my schedule to have dinner with such a good friend 
@#JustFacts✅ It was great until the last lecture we just finished. I have not alienated myself. I surprisingly have friends (not in the groupme, don't exist) and have kept up with the material thus far. Thanks for caring about me 
@#JustFacts✅ it was nice to walk through an emergency department that wasn't a total fucking disaster for once 
@#JustFacts✅ It was not at monument, but Olivia and I are there and it is dank. Best meal I’ve had in a long time 
@#JustFacts✅ just earned a spot as head pallbearer when I eventually jump off the tobin 
@#JustFacts✅ Just more haters trying to take me down 
@#JustFacts✅ just out of curiosity, are you experiencing any symptoms of botulism? Don't worry about why I'm asking, the reason isn't important 
@#JustFacts✅ Just want to say that the place in DC I picked out to go to dinner for my birthday last year (that got vetoed) won the best chef mid Atlantic James Beard 
@#JustFacts✅ KD free?
@#JustFacts✅ laughs at black people. Racist. 
@#JustFacts✅ Looks like we both missed HQ....
@#JustFacts✅ love ya bro
@#JustFacts✅ maybe
@#JustFacts✅ morning. Go save some children today 
@#JustFacts✅ My pee scale is at an 8
@#JustFacts✅ My shoes hurt my foot today. Any advice 
@#JustFacts✅ negative. Indoor rock climbers are weird enough that they place their phones in position to capture their climbs. This has selfie shot written all over it, like a screen capture from a video 
@#JustFacts✅ next time Kristen abandons you and leaves you without the ability to feed yourself, you know where to find me 
@#JustFacts✅ no
@#JustFacts✅ no. The only groupmes that I recognize are the Fuckholes and PoGo
@#JustFacts✅ Nope 
@#JustFacts✅ okay Jonah 
@#JustFacts✅ Olivia estimates it at 80%. We both will 100% be back in Stowe, she doesn't foresee them saying no. We're driving her little sister from the airport to Stowe that Friday, so there is a slim to none chance that they may not want to have people over so they could spend more time with Carmen, but Olivia doesn't think that will be the case. 
@#JustFacts✅ Olivia left Portland a little while ago and is planning on coming. She would like me to ask you what she should bring
@#JustFacts✅ Once a month or so 
@#JustFacts✅ Opinions?
@#JustFacts✅ please be safe and wear your goggles. I can't lose you
@#JustFacts✅ please comment 
@#JustFacts✅ please note that I feel bad for Ricky. Poor guy looks so embarrassed 
@#JustFacts✅ please provide this inside info. I am an equal opportunity virtue signaler. 
@#JustFacts✅ please see my comment about my plans today posted shortly after the game last night 
@#JustFacts✅ please stop
@#JustFacts✅ please update the record
@#JustFacts✅ plz respond
@#JustFacts✅ protestors were outside the white house last night. 
@#JustFacts✅ quick question. Is 398 yards, 4 touchdowns, and no picks a good game for a quarterback? I'm a little confused because I thought the player who accomplished that was supposed to be bad 
@#JustFacts✅ release the breaking news texts before @bockbot rats you out
@#JustFacts✅ remember when Kovin used intern year as an excuse as to why he didn't post as much 
@#JustFacts✅ Remind me when your last day is
@#JustFacts✅ residents have actually been great. They are all super nice, the program seems pretty tight knit and I think everyone really feels like part of a team 
@#JustFacts✅ rn
@#JustFacts✅ same. @Skimmer  skimmer. White claws have definitely been discussed multiple times in this GroupMe 
@#JustFacts✅ serious. Olivia picked out the setting she wanted earlier this month. As far as she knows, there wasn't any money to buy it but I moved some funds around. 
@#JustFacts✅ She looks at the Gram every day but I don’t believe she usually posts 
@#JustFacts✅ she never existed and continues to not exist 
@#JustFacts✅ should I give my patient pseudomonas coverage or not 
@#JustFacts✅ shoulda finished the job. Bikers are communist
@#JustFacts✅ Since Hunter Henry is clearly a bust after one week, do you want to trade me for Jimmy Graham? 
@#JustFacts✅ Skimmer 
@#JustFacts✅ some random dude in the liquor store says congrats
@#JustFacts✅ Speaking of MGH, they’re already asking me to come back to help them with an issue until they hire someone new 
@#JustFacts✅ start another argument. Make the GroupMe lit again 
@#JustFacts✅ sup
@#JustFacts✅ thank you for explaining 
@#JustFacts✅ Thanks for telling me to study an hour and a half after I had gotten to the library and started studying. I appreciate it. 
@#JustFacts✅ Thanks for the invite to your birthday dinner 
@#JustFacts✅ That’s why you were always my friend 
@#JustFacts✅ that's fair, but I would personally rather be on call for a week at a time and leave all my work the second I walk out the hospital door than maintain a clinic schedule everyday and bring my work home with me, even if it means working 7-7 instead of 7-5 
@#JustFacts✅ the GroupMe has been so unlit, I decided to spice it up with some preseason football commentary 
@#JustFacts✅ the office staff at my primary care apprenticeship all got together and bought my partner and me a cake for our last day today. How mad does that make you 
@#JustFacts✅ The one thing you might not like about TAFS is that they do not recap all the games on Sunday nights. But the ones they don’t cover get talked about on Monday 
@#JustFacts✅ they told me to wait until you came back to Boston to get my appendix out 
@#JustFacts✅ this is why we are a great team 
@#JustFacts✅ This woman brought 5 children on the train plus a baby in a stroller and one of them is crying her head off because she wants to play with a phone and the mom is ignoring her. Just has her headphones in and not even listening. This is my nightmare 
@#JustFacts✅ three buses worth of middle schoolers just dumped out at the memorial 
@#JustFacts✅ Trump said he wanted to buy Greenland. He was supposed to visit Denmark, Denmark said his desire was ludicrous, Trump cancelled visit to Denmark 
@#JustFacts✅ u up?
@#JustFacts✅ update, the broncos offense is still bad 
@#JustFacts✅ wait
@#JustFacts✅ Want to get dinner after work thing tonight? 
@#JustFacts✅ Want to hang out this weekend?

@#JustFacts✅ was it you who recommended the 8th grade movie? 
@#JustFacts✅ was my good friend Bocker invited? 
@#JustFacts✅ Was this the party you were telling us about freshman year? 
@#JustFacts✅ we are leaving at 8 am tomorrow morning. We will be at dinner. @Artisanal Anal Artist I will unfortunately not be able to climb tomorrow 
@#JustFacts✅ we are required to wear eye protection in the ED (on top of your glasses if you have them), and the goggles they give us fog immediately. I walk in a room and instantly cannot see the person to which I am talking 
@#JustFacts✅ weren’t you supposed to give us a post count
@#JustFacts✅ Wes does not think that Guice is a great talent. All accounts don't agree 
@#JustFacts✅ what are my playoff chances
@#JustFacts✅ what do you think about "Venezia was VEryNICE" for my next post
@#JustFacts✅ what do you think the Fuckswoles GroupMe consists of?

@#JustFacts✅ When are you publishing our research so I can get my name on another publication 
@#JustFacts✅ when be sees a poor person 
@#JustFacts✅ when you are debating whether or not to invite me to your wedding, just remember this day. The day I was here for you when no one else was. 
@#JustFacts✅ who did you interview with? 
@#JustFacts✅ Whose bitmoji looks more like them? Me or @Joey Brackets?
@#JustFacts✅ why are you sending Morcus screenshots of the GroupMe
@#JustFacts✅ why don't you start your own hatchery and raise tuna to harvest sushi grade fish
@#JustFacts✅ why has Morcus not answered me
@#JustFacts✅ ya boi has two interviews in DC. Got long term space in your nook?
@#JustFacts✅ yes
@#JustFacts✅ yes
@#JustFacts✅ you are no longer the worst 
@#JustFacts✅ you asked that several weeks ago. The question has still not been answered. 
@#JustFacts✅ you didn't like my office gif 
@#JustFacts✅ you look skinny. Are you eating well enough? 
@#JustFacts✅ you should hire Juice 
@#JustFacts✅ you should invite me when you eat at these.places 
@#JustFacts✅ you think my lack of tv channels is bad, Goody doesn't even get NBC
@#JustFacts✅ you will get what you get and like it 
@#JustFacts✅ you'll be happy to know that I decided to pay for a 1 bed room apartment for my next rotation in maine. 
@#JustFacts✅ you'll be proud of me. A friend was telling the story and could not remember the name of the "famous golf course in long island." Ya boi dropped that bethpage black knowledge bomb 
@#JustFacts✅ Your outburst? Pretty sure that was all on Chan and Jordan 
@#JustFacts✅ your wife stole $500 from me
@#JustFacts✅ you're a dick got getting Kristen sick
@#JustFacts✅ you're a monster. Forget I ever said hi. 
@#JustFacts✅ you're the first person in the history of people to ever say that CK was comparable to step 1 in terms of suckiness 
@#JustFacts✅ 👀👀

@#Just📠✅ 
@#Just📠✅  Can you believe how wrong this GroupMe is about iPads?
@#Just📠✅ @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD imagine being a Harvard medical student/graduate of their program lmao. Their cadaver lab director literally sold and shipped body parts, through the mail, that he stole from dead bodies 
@#Just📠✅ Any comment on John's Instagram story

@#Just📠✅ please don't commit suicide before the PK challenge 
@#Just📠✅ please have Kristen explain why she keeps rigging her charitable raffles
@#Just📠✅ please make sure Kristen knows that only @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD and I were confident enough in her to bet that she was going to get a PR 
@#Just📠✅ sometimes, no matter how hard you try, people will still make bad decisions and you will be disappointed in them 
@#Just📠✅ thank you
@#Just📠✅ thank you for your service 
@#Just📠✅ thinks it's repulsive that Jack Francis could grow up to enjoy blowing dudes.

@#SATofJustice📝 Congrats on the win. I'm locking it up for you
@#SATofJustice📝 Depends.....
@#SATofJustice📝 Do you enjoy being stuffed? 
@#SATofJustice📝 don’t worry, I won’t put up 90 this week, I guarantee it 
@#SATofJustice📝 He apparently is on crutches and definitely had the right mechanism of injury for an acl tear 
@#SATofJustice📝 Hey

@#SATofJustice📝 I’m not studying the Krebs cycle anymore. Sorry, you’re the one who is alone 
@#SATofJustice📝 I’m really happy that Philip Rivers had such a good game for you. You really deserve that, especially after that the Pilgrims did to your people 
@#SATofJustice📝 Yeah or just save it to your camera reel 
@#TeamBecker🏌🏽 @The Big Dick Bandit is it weird that I had a dream that New Money retired from the ATN podcast and was genuinely sad 
@#TeamBecker🏌🏽 Amirite?!
@#YesWeChanseco  @Matt Levine’s Parrot  Apparently there is a petition to rename Columbus, OH to Flavortown, OH. I can only imagine that you two are behind this.
@#YesWeChanseco  I signed up this week for a webinar on how to be an active ally to Asian individuals suffering from acts of prejudice and racism. I wish I was there so I could have stood up for you during that blatant microaggression.

@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  man those last few minutes really showed how great of a coach Daz is. Thanks for showing me the light.
@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  My stats professor had a 🔥 take on 538. He went on a long rant, but the gist of it was, “if their articles were based on good science or good statistical analysis, they’d be published in acamemic journals and not on some website. No one wants to research and write for 538 unless they can’t get a job at an academic institution” 
@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  thoughts on the criticism that the Dems are getting for having the SOTU rebuttal done by a privileged white male instead of a woman of color like Kamala Harris?

@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 Another aspect of the ACA that I didn't know: there is language that allows for the use of biosimilars, which are essentially generic versions of really expensive drugs that treat autoimmune diseases. (E.g. We use remicade and about 6 other biologics for inflammatory bowel disease). Despite Europe developing and using these cheaper versions, and the FDA approving the first biosimilar for use in the US, pharmaceutical companies are pushing more patents to prevent generic versions from being developed. Instead of limiting costs, which was the ACA goal, pharma has basically taken the insurance companies hostage and prevents physicians from prescribing essentially identical, cheaper products. 
@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 appreciate the support. I have my gym clothes with me and going to go workout right after class in 10 minutes

@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) don’t you see that how good Drake is playing now juetifies him being named FLB before he was even drafted?
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) dosages with us, @Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) 
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Hello
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Hey
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) How do you feel that Drake hired a bot network (maybe even you were involved) to stream his songs to inflate his number of listens by tens of millions
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Imagine not having a child and still skimming
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) My friend (and co-best man with you) Simon is an anesthesiologist and I am sure would be happy to chat if your brother has questions 
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Remember when Jordan tried to steal our fruity pebbles while we were playing Super Smash and guzzling Darrow Balls 
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Sorry man 
@ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) Was always my friend ever since we sat next to each other on the bus on the 2nd grade field trip to the butterfly place

@AdamSchefter: Here's the actual deal: SF is trading Vernon Davis and a 2016 7th-round pick to Denver for a 6th in 2016 and a 6th in 2017, per sources.
@AdamSchefter: More testing likely and further updates ahead, but one source just texted this on Gronk's leg injury: "Doesn't appear to be serious."
@AdamSchefter: NFLPA reviewing info to see if there's collusion b/w Broncos-Cowboys on unsettled contracts of Demaryius Thomas/Dez Bryant, per PA official.

@Andrew Becker  Hi
@Andrew Becker  Olivia and I are now unable to come to dinner on Friday. She just got a call that someone she knows in Stowe passed away so we have to go up there Friday-Saturday
@Andrew Becker but 200% > 100%. Don't see what the issue us 
@Andrew Becker giant douche and turd sandwich* 
@Andrew Becker How's white mountain 
@Andrew Becker I don't know 
@Andrew Becker I have nothing to read about loans. They'll all be forgiven in 2 years, minimum 
@Andrew Becker please judge this social media post 
@Andrew Becker That is true. Although I think he ended hitting the game winner as time expired 
@Anesto's Fairweather Fan How about Bumgarner taking Kershaw deep
@Anesto's Fairweather Fan Steph Curry is a bitch. Doesn't have the heart to win in this league. 
@Anthony Goodwin 
@Anthony Goodwin 
@Anthony Goodwin @Two Time Good news guys! DeVos wants to kill the loan forgiveness program and make tweaks to the income based loan repayment program. 
@Anthony Goodwin ^
@Anthony Goodwin Any 10k training updates? 
@Anthony Goodwin are you watching the GB-Jacksonville game?
@Anthony Goodwin can we get an early prediction on win total for next season?
@Anthony Goodwin Care to debate with @The Big Dick Bandit on that?
@Anthony Goodwin Did you see any applicants on campus today? That would have been me...
@Anthony Goodwin Do the Yankees still need starting pitching? I heard Buchholz is available 
@Anthony Goodwin have you killed any patients yet? @Idris Elba needs to get a few easy cases under his belt before he sues Niantic/Nintendo/Google to get Pokevision back.
@Anthony Goodwin Hi
@Anthony Goodwin How does frank like Ricky?
@Anthony Goodwin How happy are you that both Auburn and PSU lost? I may be happier than when BC won it's bowl game. 
@Anthony Goodwin How hard did Tiger's blog post make you?
@Anthony Goodwin How was my best friend Ricky's birthday 
@Anthony Goodwin I don't know if he'll keep his job when Jamaal Charles is back up to full reps but he's the starter until then 
@Anthony Goodwin I just finished my CASper test. 1) fuck that shit. 2) my first question was on transgender use of bathrooms 
@Anthony Goodwin I know you're busy studying and all but the Yankees just got swept in a four game series. Get rekt. 
@Anthony Goodwin I see you referencing the book I sent you to read. Don't you like being informed?
@Anthony Goodwin Idiot.

@Anthony Goodwin the name of the ripping asshole pictures you're referring to are "goatse"
@Anthony Goodwin Tufts was great. Loved it. Thought it went really well. Only downside is they promised me a gluten free lunch and that was not provided 
@Anthony Goodwin Was always my friend 
@Anthony Goodwin was never my friend 
@Anthony Goodwin what are my chances of winning tonight 
@Anthony Goodwin Why didn't that tag. Stupid groupme 
@Anthony Goodwin You could basically repost this about @The Big Dick Bandit 
@Artisanal Anal Artist  As far as I understand them, bird rights allow a team to sign one of their own players to a max deal that exceeds salary cap.
@Artisanal Anal Artist  how do you feel about your former love interests all being super racists?
@Artisanal Anal Artist  pepperoni pizza, oikos triple zero greek yogurt, starbucks vanilla latte with two pumps of caramel with whip cream and chocolate syrup
@Artisanal Anal Artist I'm in medical school. Bones and ligaments sure basically the same thing. Trust me
@Artisanal Anal Artist just reminding you that you lost the posa 
@Artisanal Anal Artist to my knowledge, no but I honestly don't know

@Baileys, Guinness + Me can we have Carrot's intelligentsia ranking now?
@Baileys, Guinness + Me did you mail Goody's present to NYC?
@Baileys, Guinness + Me The messaging from insurance companies on why they have prior auths theoretically make sense: they want to limit the prescribing of expensive drugs to strictly the appropriate clinical situations. It prevents prescribers from using expensive drugs for off label reasons, or applying them to people that may not qualify (i.e. their disease severity isn't enough to warrant escalating to a more expensive drug). But as Bocker and Kovin are alluding to, prior auths get required for the most bullshit things, like for prilosec or for getting an MRI that a spinal surgeon ordered because he/she/they thought was indicated.\
@Baileys, Guinness + Me wtf

@Belmont=Great Mid-Major  you aren't allowed to support this new coach

@Boe Jourque  are you still fucked for the rest of your life or has his curse worn off?
@Boe Jourque  back to those videos showing use of excessive force and frankly awful police behavior, and then Nick saying no one would be fired....Atlanta fired police offers today after footage showed them using excessive force to antagonize protestors
@Boe Jourque  Because I care about your health, I have to recommend that you wear a helmet when skateboarding like your friend in your video.
@Boe Jourque  bought bitcoin in 2012 and is a poor like me

@Boe Jourque  I'm gunna let you fight that fight with Morcus. #NotMyNarrative
@Boe Jourque  Italy graduated a bunch of med students early to move them into the workforce. AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) recommended pulling all med students from clinical sites yesterday. Harvard still has a lot of its students working on non-clinical tasks, such as triaging phone calls, making sure PPE is stocked, ensuring infection control practices are being adhered to (with advisement from infectious disease, of course).
@Boe Jourque  Please update the Google Doc
@Boe Jourque  please wear a helmet

@Boe Jourque apparently a few staffers had the foresight to grab the electoral ballots before the chambers were breached. Imagine if that had not happened 
@Boe Jourque can we get your assessment on sum 41 
@Boe Jourque can you imagine someone going to Dartmouth thinking he's superior than anyone else in the GroupMe? 
@Boe Jourque finally listened to the fleet foxes song you told me to listen to. It wasn't bad, I would try more of their stuff I guess but the song doesn't get me hooked 
@Boe Jourque has also been to Portland. Please tell Marcus that he's an idiot 
@Boe Jourque he says it's a coup attempt 
@Boe Jourque hi
@Boe Jourque hope someone gives you a helmet for your birthday
@Boe Jourque how is discovering black holes or building MRI machines or whatever you're doing these days 
@Boe Jourque how is the rona?
@Boe Jourque how was your day 
@Boe Jourque I can't vote for Ed Markey tomorrow because I voted for Ed Markey over a week ago 
@Boe Jourque I think you have a leak
@Boe Jourque if you want to get revenge on @Mr. Chan for burning your house down, here is his address 
@Boe Jourque is here
@Boe Jourque just saw a thrasher shirt out in the wild. Thought you should know
@Boe Jourque lied to me 34 minutes ago 
@Boe Jourque looks like you have a helmet on. Smart 
@Boe Jourque Marcus thought it was a little weird that @GeoffPoor came to the birthing class too and held Shelbie's other hand while she pushed 
@Boe Jourque Mayor Pete was in Malden today 
@Boe Jourque Otto Rocket
@Boe Jourque please report on this matter 
@Boe Jourque RIP your long weekend 
@Boe Jourque skimmer. Chan already confirmed free parking on campus in the garage
@Boe Jourque so I'm at the mumford and sons concert. The lead singer has used three different acoustic guitars and two different electric guitars in the first 6 songs. Tell me why that's not excessive? 
@Boe Jourque still waiting for you to come talk to us about whatever you want 
@Boe Jourque wanna meet me at Brown to take my exam with me tomorrow? 
@Boe Jourque we did it. We carried the water for 4 years, but we made it 
@Boe Jourque wear a helmet please 
@Boe Jourque well that's because the protestors aren't black 
@Boe Jourque what's your top cheese steak place in Philly 
@Boe Jourque ya boy being financed by corporate lobbyists. Not a good look. 
@Boe Jourque ya boy is a fuck face

@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) for our steak dinner at your place
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) had one of those days where he couldn’t miss
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) Hi
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) I bought a Blackstone from Walmart yesterday. I’m supporting the cause
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) I feel like we are taking crazy pills
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) I used the tale of your victory to hype up my father in law when trying to convince him to take someone to small claims court 
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) Making sure that I add you to the list of people I am tagging 
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) preemptive bonk
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) Sorry
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) sounds like a perfect job for @Skimmer to do pro bono
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) That’s legit. I love that for my boi
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) was always my friend since graduation 
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) You were left off of the list of people who took the bet. The others off of the list (albeit on their own accord) are going to come over to your place for a nice Chan-made meat dinner 
@Bryson DeChanBo (Creator of #Content) You’re a great friend, despite what @Skimmer says

@Champion ‘11 & ‘20 glad you really slaved over the stove to cook for your wife
@Champion ‘11 & ‘20 hope you enjoy the anniversary of the day that you tore your mother's perineum

@Chancy Reagan  isn't a suspect but I wanted to makes sure that he was included on the list
@Chancy Reagan  You have done a great service for the empire.
@Chancy Reagan Being racist and misogynistic is perfectly acceptable. Just look at our president. 
@Chancy Reagan good morning. Hope your parents have safe travels today 
@Chancy Reagan he had an unexpected contractor come to the ED, where is he is a medical director, and he had to deal with that I guess 
@Chancy Reagan hey you got a completion
@Chancy Reagan hi buddy. Miss you 
@Chancy Reagan honeycrisp ciders are too sweet so you dodged a bullet 
@Chancy Reagan I also know you were joking and appreciate the banter 
@Chancy Reagan I don't want you to put a bet in for me, but could you just send me $19,000? Thanks! 
@Chancy Reagan I thought you would be happy that I was watching the game and legitimately excited for our team 
@Chancy Reagan Is patriots girl coming on Sunday 
@Chancy Reagan it's not as fun when you call me out for stuff 
@Chancy Reagan Thank you again for hosting the Fuckholes last night. It was very nice of you to tolerate a room of patriots fans during the lowest and highest emotions we've get in two years 
@Chancy Reagan the election is not and will never be funny
@Chancy Reagan the groupme has not received a Taylor Swift album review. Your other social media content doesn't count 
@Chancy Reagan What are the answers to the other questions we didn't get 
@Chancy Reagan 🔥 take: peace was the best song between both albums. Don't @ me 
@Chandalay Industries are you cool with a little waterboarding? 
@Chandler Parsons Becker wants to know where you're golfing next week 
@Chandler Parsons coming out of Fuckhole retirement now that Goody has been ousted?

@Chandrew Becker  spreading fake news again
@Chandrew Becker back to where it all started #SharkTank #SquattyPotty
@Chandrew Becker I appreciate you making the effort to organize, but alas, I cannot attend. It is for the greater good, however, as now you won't be limited by my defective duodenum. 
@Chandrew Jackson damn, I am sorry Joe did that to you. Please know that you're an excellent friend and Joe's inability to treat you with respect does not reflect on you.

@Chank Hill  Your love is brilliant. Your love is pure.
@Chank Hill  You're even better
@Chank Hill @#Just📠✅ how do we feel about Taylor's secret songs tonight
@Chank Hill after the games today 
@Chank Hill All Too Well in the rain looks fucking insane. 
@Chank Hill are you trying to make me sadder 
@Chank Hill can I get a weekend video a day early?
@Chank Hill do you perchance have a Ronnie Hillman jersey?
@Chank Hill hope you have a day 
@Chank Hill how did you end the Co's turn out today?
@Chank Hill how does it make you feel that all goody gave you for secret Moses was an Alabama Gordon Callender jersey and flavortown/broncos socks but Bocker got a dildo and a bidet last year 
@Chank Hill I think that you need to fix the GroupMe banner. It isn't accurate anymore 
@Chank Hill is that my banner?
@Chank Hill keeps ducking my question 
@Chank Hill please post your last text exchange with the #ThirstTrapShooter💦📷
@Chank Hill real talk, the clear white sprite bottles are trash 
@Chank Hill RELEASE THE TEXTS
@Chank Hill was always my friend since fall 2014 while attending a BC football game as alumni
@Chank Hill what were Blink's surprise songs? 
@Chank Hill you could have brought me. I was actually in New England when you went
@Chank Hill you ignored my post 
@Chanley Yelnats big win for the horses today
@Chanley Yelnats go ahead and mail me my L 
@Chanley Yelnats I was actually referencing this
@Chanley Yelnats oh shit! How are you holding up with this news?
@Chanley Yelnats skimmer. Goody already commented on the sushi 
@Channa Kournikova How could they have known what picture that were posting? 
@Channa Kournikova We want Channe Frank 
@Channah Montana dont be modest. We know you did the leg work for the team. John can't carry a team on one leg
@Channah Montana good morning Christopher
@Channah Montana good morning Christopher 
@Channah Montana I had the same thing happen to me in Somerville and they denied my appeal. Then they didn't tell me it was denied until they sent me a letter informing me that my fine increased for not paying within 30 days 
@Channe Frank
@Channe Frank flop
@Channe Frank what does Patriots girl think about Hightower? 
@Channe Frank! @Channe Frank! @Channe Frank!
@Channie Mae  But you left Boston....
@Channie Mae  hi
@Channie Mae  I don't make monetary bets when I don't have an income. It's not fiscally appropriate.
@Channie Mae  Unfortunately I need something with evidence supporting it. It hasn't been implemented previously in the US so there are not data to support an argument for or against itr
@Channie Mae Darrow or Nick. I thought this was a Jew thing since all of ny was affected
@Channie Mae I recognize your remark and half no come back at this time 
@Channing Tatum how does it feel to have Sanchez as qb, a #1 cb who is dumb enough to shoot himself on the leg, and a defensive star who is willing to sit out a whole season and give up making $14.5mil?
@Channy Pacquiao 
@Channy Woodhead No. Browns fans are passionate. Most bc fans are indifferent

@Chanthony Goodwin was always my friend. I am sorry for not tagging you. You're far more reliable than @Skimmer is 
@Chantonio Banderas  Can I get my face and a K's logo photoshopped here?
@Chantonio Brown You have to slow Brees down. If he gets all of the points you need to beat me before the first half is over, it won't be entertaining 
@Chris “Draymond Green” Chan 
@Chris “Draymond Green” Chan thanks for looking out for me 
@Chris Chan  just said Bruce Lee = 🐐
@Chris Chan Come here so I can argue with you pointlessly until the game starts or until I get bored
@Chris Chan I also have 8/11. Could this be the day that not one, but two comments reach 11?!
@Chris Chan Just watched your snapchat story. Really nice form man. I'd say you're probably the best golfer in the Fuckholes 
@Chris Chan Rockets are bad. 
@Chris Chan Your lord has risen 
@Chris Chan Your offense looks bad, and you should feel bad. 
@Chris Chan, don't forget to snap your dinner for Becker

@DJ Chanukah “fewer than”
@DJ Chanukah All the commercials suck. Be better. 
@DJ Chanukah Booooooo
@DJ Chanukah Hi 
@DJ Chanukah I was walking home when Joe posted the tweets about gronk. I saw they were from barstool and for whatever reason assumed you posted them. When Joe posted an updated tweet, I thought he was doing so to prove you wrong, this making you #FakeNews. However, I can see now that Joe was just contradicting himself and making an IDIOT of himself which is very easy to do 
@DJ Chanukah If the invite still stands, I plan to be over Sunday night 
@DJ Chanukah if you want to rent out your apartment, house have to make sure that Houston is hosting 
@DJ Chanukah it's at a restaurant, bottles aren't for sale. The bottles are sold for $5k+ on the black market in kentucky
@DJ Chanukah No recognition for putting you first on my list? 
@DJ Chanukah Remember the game after that overtime win against the Steelers? 
@DJ Chanukah rn after Bocker just put his PS skills to shame 
@DJ Chanukah That’s weird, you would think you’d hang out with more of them if most of your coworkers were girls 
@DJ Chanukah too bad goody fucked up the bracket challenge and so this one doesn't count

@Dr. LT Kelleher  How is the PoGo in NM?
@Dr. LT Kelleher  I will continue to beat this dead horse into the ground, as is GroupMe tradition. You can go ahead and lose my number.
@Dr. LT Kelleher  It looks like Joe Kelly also threw over Correa's head and then yapped at him after striking him out, which precipitated the bench clearing.
@Dr. LT Kelleher  People forget when Kenny died of the rona
@Dr. LT Kelleher  Please consider how hurtful your words can be
@Dr. LT Kelleher  Reveal please

@Dr. LT Kelleher I think your boss probably should so something about this 
@Dr. LT Kelleher I'm going to do what I can to make you proud 
@Dr. LT Kelleher Jboss. I hear he doesn't do well with pain 
@Dr. LT Kelleher my pick is also tied in the 4th

@Female Body Inspector Agent #69  we just finished a game and are in the lobby.
@Female Body Inspector Agent #69  Whoops I changed my display name and it restarted my game
@Female Body Inspector Agent #69 be mindful of travel restrictions. Vermont requires out of state travelers to quarantine for 14 days or 7 days with a negative test. I assume Joe is breaking the law but I know you would never want to do that

@John Thompson What is the name of the world's largest plateau and where is it located 
"@John Thompson Would highly recommend:
-capitol cider (went three times while we were here, food is good, they have 230+ ciders and a good amount of regular beer)
-the nest bar (rooftop bar at the Thompson hotel; website says to make a reservation but we did and they put us at a table that had a $50 reservation fee. If you just walk in, you should be able to get in and get a great view of the sunset without a fee if you go around 8:30 pm)
-if you can rent a car, go out to Rainier and hike the Skyline Loop in the paradise section of the park. It's incredible"

@JustFacts✅ make sure you put stickum on your gloves so you don't drop the babies 
@JustFacts✅ my actual response to bowling is that Olivia and I have a christmas party to go to around 8 so if we bowl before that, I'm in. If you guys go closer to 8, I can't make it 
@JustFacts✅ my dad literally just forwarded me an email about it 
@JustFacts✅ random question. What is the political spectrum of your classmates? If there is a single person in my class who leans right, they don't show it and I was just curious if that was an anomaly at Tufts or something more common in the medical profession
@JustFacts✅ sup
@JustFacts✅ the arbitrator can only recommend a punishment. The league can choose to accept the decision or appeal. All appeals go to Roger or someone he appoints. So he still basically has unilateral power to make decisions

@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco EILI5: why are people speculating that implementation of a no fly zone would lead to a larger war/nuclear arms use
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco ELI5: sanctions. What are they, why do they matter, do they do anything? 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco from reading headlines, it seems that the Russians have retreated even more? Is this true? 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco from what Ukraine seems to be saying, there is not an international military presence aiding them. If every nation is condemning this, why aren't we just all piling into Ukraine. I feel like the 3.5 million troops that NATO has access to should be able to defend against 200k Russian troops
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco glad you are choosing to celebrate a momentous anniversary by moving to the city where it all happened 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco hi 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco I stayed in a hotel in Dupont circle twice. V close to Metro. I went to 5 Guys (the restaurant, preempting any comments from @The Big Dick Bandit) there and had a lovely meal. Clearly I am the authority on DC. I say you should move there
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco one of the nurses I work with in the ED spent his 20s at Holloman 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco rn
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco sorry for your loss. 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco tried my best 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco what's your ruling? 
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco you literally just got there
@Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco 👀👀👀
@King Of The Bourques  do anything special with your roommates for your birthday?
@King Of The Bourques hey Darrow. I hope you celebrate today by having your running back suck a fat turd

@Legitimate Business Man  @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  Ever have one of those days where you just can't miss?
@Legitimate Business Man  2
@Legitimate Business Man  Black people were segregated into communities, forced for generations to have low-paying jobs, excluded from educational opportunities. If more black people are drug dealers, it is because of racism. If more black people are arrested, it is because of racism.
@Legitimate Business Man  brings up Herbert more than anyone I've ever met
@Legitimate Business Man  didn't know that about them working together. Curious about what more comes out about their work/life relationship
@Legitimate Business Man  One of us got it right
@Legitimate Business Man I have not made my decision yet

@LiChan al Gaib can I commission you to not do @#JustFacts ✅'s Photoshop request? 
@LiChan al Gaib go to bed, sweet prince. Russ will be there when you wake up. You have to get your rest for work

@Long Hauler might be the only person to come to my birthday dinner tomorrow. I'm conflicted
@Long Hauler sorry I can't wish you a happy birthday 
@M. Stribling Bauer goody is making a joke that the MAC is the best conference and that we should have taken the opportunity to be in their conference 
@M. Stribling Bauer I feel like that's a fair rule. People with handicaps shouldn't take up space from working people just trying to make a living and get home at the end of a day
@M. Stribling Bauer Shelbie is bringing a life into the world. You're just gambling away JJ's diaper fund 
@M. Stribling Bauer shoulda spent less time eating and more time studying 
@M. Stribling Bauer the gluten free community doesn't want you 
@M. Stribling Bauer yes. @The Big Dick Bandit depends on your definition

@Marcus Bauer  According to Baker, MA has requested ventilators and was promised 1,000. They haven't had a single one delivered. MA Also purchased 3 million masks, which the feds actually seized from a port and gave out to other states. Baker had to work with the Krafts and the Chinese ambassador to organize a "private humanitarian mission" to hide the masks from the feds so they wouldn't get seized again.
@Marcus Bauer  As the only father in the GroupMe, how many pairs of New Balance sneakers do you own?
@Marcus Bauer  case in point.
"@Marcus Bauer  Criteria for testing sites is as follows:

Shortness of breath
Cough
Must show a temperature of 99.6 or higher"
@Marcus Bauer  flop
@Marcus Bauer  found you a new gambling opportunity:
@Marcus Bauer  Happened once to Auburn? We should go back to the BCS....
@Marcus Bauer  Happy International Women's Day
@Marcus Bauer  hi buddy. Hope you had a nice day.
@Marcus Bauer  Hope you don't die today.
@Marcus Bauer  how much time have you spent with Ryan Fitzpatrick lately?
@Marcus Bauer  I am concerned about your sleeping position. Stomach sleeping is less healthy for your spine and can exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea (often co-morbid with obesity)
@Marcus Bauer  I got your back, buddy. No Celiac walks alone.
@Marcus Bauer  I have re-completed the Doodle and saved it
@Marcus Bauer  I hope you are making Shelbie eat a gluten-free diet so JJ doesn't accidentally get glutened
@Marcus Bauer  Might be the best one yet
@Marcus Bauer  Oh I agree. I don't think Trump is doing it to be political. I think the HHS is method if distribution is flawed and is their own doing, not some nefarious decision by Trump
@Marcus Bauer  take that as an insult
@Marcus Bauer  Thank you for working so hard to adjudicate this issue
@Marcus Bauer  Thanks for subbing in, buddy.
@Marcus Bauer  Thanks Marcus, I just finally wanted someone to admit that I was robbed
@Marcus Bauer  This one particular systematic review that I know nothing about and just found randomly to support my argument says that optimism causes people to engage in stressors instead of withdrawing from them, leading to increased cortisol levels and decreased immune functioning
@Marcus Bauer  trashing @Bhagavan Joe Exotic  rn
@Marcus Bauer  we won't know tomorrow if the commissioner is fine with a later draft time because he's probably already asleep - on  California time too
@Marcus Bauer  What's your take on the medical schools that give medical students free tuition funded by university donations
@Marcus Bauer  Which Fuckholes got chosen? Did you choose? Did you go with Bocker again? You do remember how badly that ended last time, right?
@Marcus Bauer @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  tell your republican buddies to fuck off, this bill would increase my taxes by over 200% https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/07/the-gop-tax-plan-will-destroy-graduate-education/#71ddc8433d2f
@Marcus Bauer @Mr. Large Pectorals how is the birth coming along? 
@Marcus Bauer @Skimmer did either of you ever see a dime for that work? 
@Marcus Bauer Are you excited to watch Alabama play in their first game of the season?!
@Marcus Bauer as the GroupMe's best football player (cc: @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs @Jamie Bourque @Chancy Reagan), how hard is it to remember to report as an eligible receiver when you know the fake punt throw is going your way 
@Marcus Bauer Because past performance doesn’t predict future production, Marcus. He’s probably going to have the best ST unit in the country next week 
@Marcus Bauer Bocker, Darrowball, and Emyr each have two college degrees 
@Marcus Bauer Can Olivia, Jordan, Emyr, Jamie, and I stay with you and can I throw my "not invited to the wedding" party at your apartment while you're gone? 
@Marcus Bauer can you comment on why Bocker is a best man but isn't invited to the wedding?
@Marcus Bauer Did Shelbie have a nice birthday? 
@Marcus Bauer did you factor Mike Bloomberg into the league count? 
@Marcus Bauer don't validate him for doing something that he literally signed up to do. Every medical student does it. 
@Marcus Bauer Get the fuck in here 
@Marcus Bauer glad you and I are the only real football fans in this groupme
@Marcus Bauer great contribution to the GroupMe. Love the fire you bring to the game
@Marcus Bauer gunna have to go through the trash 
@Marcus Bauer hadn't followed up on that story after the initial reports. I think the skepticism in the article is fair
@Marcus Bauer hasn't responded to my texts. Only can assume that @#JustFacts✅ killed him. 
@Marcus Bauer Herzlich reminds me a lot of Witten 
@Marcus Bauer Hope you don't die today slightly more than I hope you don't die other days.

@Marcus Bauer I voted for the ButtChug Express 
@Marcus Bauer I wouldn't put money on something that's never going to happen 
@Marcus Bauer I’m excited to see you too 
@Marcus Bauer Im eating baked fish with sauteed vegetables for lunch. Be better

@Marcus Bauer plenty of food here for you when you eat all the leftovers tonight 
@Marcus Bauer plz respond 
@Marcus Bauer so the Jordan's furniture contents every year where they say "you could be refunded for your furniture purchases if the red sox do xyx" - I don't actually have to buy anything to win something?

@Marcus Bauer Stidham looks good 
@Marcus Bauer Still waiting on the Thompson Twins to go to a women's sporting event too!

@Marcus Bauer the nerve of some groupme members, huh?
@Marcus Bauer there is a reason that communism didn't work, and it wasn't because the ussr didn't try hard enough. It's cuz this guy wasn't around to fix it

@Marcus Bauer we already talked about this 
@Marcus Bauer we did in fact make it

@Mr. Chan no homo, but you look very handsome in your most recent insta post 
@Mr. Chan plus you cant expect, as the artist, that people are all 22 songs are gunna be bangers. Stick to the 12 best ones and release the others on some mixtape (do people still do mixtapes now?) 
@Mr. Chan thanks boo, but she asked me to ask you guys for opinions 
@Mr. Chan there are too many girls in your insta story. This disproves bocker's theory that you don't hang out with girls. Please fix your ratio so #BockersNarrative goes back to being true 
@Mr. Chan very easy to throw money around when you have a paying career 
@Mr. Chan will update you at lunch when I have time to come up with a formal plan. Trying to finish my notes so I can go home early

@Nick D I disagree that it had a coherent message. There were three competing themes between the white supremacy thing and cartman's relationship problems and the over-reliance on technology. All three things didn't blend well for me

@Skimmer  ABBREVIATED R WORD
@Skimmer  as a lawyer, would you say the litigant’s documented statements of “nothing was ever officially agreed upon” and “I don’t care” constitute evidence against his own case?
@Skimmer  As the resident Red Sox fan, how should I feel about the Chaim Bloom hiring?
@Skimmer  Big Whig guy
@Skimmer  For our finals matchup, let's both bench our whole team except our kickers. Kicker vs. Kicker.
@Skimmer  have you sold your Tesla yet?
@Skimmer  hey can I join your tea,?
@Skimmer  Hi
@Skimmer  hi
@Skimmer  how do you feel about Goody using the r word? (I'm afraid the original post got too far down and @Skimmer  won't read it)
@Skimmer  how do you sleep with @The Big Dick Bandit  at night?
@Skimmer  how is the new job giving children lung cancer?
@Skimmer  I am sorry about what these fuckholes are doing to rap. Please don't lump me in with them
@Skimmer  I believe 3 years
@Skimmer  I have yet to be added to your team as a co-manager
@Skimmer  I hope that we are close enough friends that if I ever said/did something that made you uncomfortable or hurt that you would tell me. You're a great person and an even better friend.
@Skimmer  I started Mahomes. He has more points than Brees now.
@Skimmer  I think you're going to have to give up your name to John soon
@Skimmer  I was about to have a minor freakout over the Sox DHing Pedroia and putting JumboDong in RF but I realized its only because JBJ has the day off. Crisis averted
@Skimmer  I'm going to quit working out now because Jordan made me feel bad
@Skimmer  is apparently Elon's biggest stan
@Skimmer  is going to skim the answer to his question, isn't he
@Skimmer  is here
@Skimmer  Isn't it great that both our teams are 5-2?
@Skimmer  Jboss will let you use his parking space if you come to dinner
@Skimmer  Non-Fuckhole fantasy question. Would you start Mahomes against the Rams who have struggled the past few weeks or Brees against the Eagles who just lost one of their best corners
@Skimmer  plz respond
@Skimmer  R WORD
@Skimmer  R WORD
@Skimmer  saying he would rather glaze her?
@Skimmer  So what you're saying, is the rest of us are privileged to be able to interact in the GroupMe because of systemic injustices
@Skimmer  Still waiting to know how I am supposed to feel about Chaim Bloom. Don't think I didn't notice you like my post and not respond
@Skimmer  Tell me how to feel

@Skimmer @The Big Dick Bandit Olivia wants to know how Drake killed Meek Mill's career. I can't do the explanation justice.
@Skimmer @The Big Dick Bandit thoughts on this potential trade with philly for the number one pick 
@Skimmer ain’t no skimmer 
@Skimmer always keeping me honest 
@Skimmer and @2023 FH Open Chanpion didn't show up though 
@Skimmer and Becker are the only two not attending 
@Skimmer Are you coming to brunch?
@Skimmer are you coming tonight? Free parking in southie on weekends 
@Skimmer Are you going to brunch on Sunday? Free street parking 
@Skimmer Are you still alive
@Skimmer are you still in Seattle bringing Bill Gates to justice or whatever you are doing

@Skimmer Big Democrat guy
@Skimmer biked a couple miles to drop by bike off to be tuned and then ran back home. No gym today

@Skimmer Can you please confirm your intent to attend? 
@Skimmer Chan you confirm? 
@Skimmer come back and love me figuratively 
@Skimmer come in and tell these fools that they are fools 
@Skimmer comes in after not posting for days and thinks he can morally shame members of the Fuckholes. 
@Skimmer Did you ever bone that chick you went to the Patriots game with? 
@Skimmer did you find good parking yesterday? (3/5/23)

@Skimmer How come you’re playing TCG but not responding to GroupMe messages 
@Skimmer How do you feel about fruits? Do you like the Celtics chances tonight? 
@Skimmer how do you reconcile Elon being a completely trash human with the fact that you are supporting him in his endeavor to be incomprehensibly wealthy? 
@Skimmer how does it feel to be sole commander of the team that will knock Joe off in the consolation match 
@Skimmer how is your weekend going 
@Skimmer How's the case going? 
@Skimmer I am sorry that Goody is trying to profit socially off of the history of racism and violence that has long plagued black people in America 
@Skimmer I hope you had a perfectly average Sunday! 
@Skimmer I just want you to know that I missed you at dinner last night. 
@Skimmer I listened to Kendrick's new album. Did not like it 
@Skimmer I miss you. How is life?
@Skimmer I missed you. 
@Skimmer I need to hire a lawyer 
@Skimmer I noticed you didn't come tonight
@Skimmer I respect how much smarter at fantasy you are than I am 
@Skimmer I talked about fried okra and fried chicken with an African American physician yesterday. Does that make me racist or incredibly supportive of stereotypical southern black cuisine  
@Skimmer I will continue to talk trash about everyone’s team, except for my best friend Bocker’s team 
@Skimmer I won't be quitting because I'd have to listen to the GroupMe bitch everyday until I die of a heart attack 
@Skimmer I’ll offer you whatever Bocker is offering plus $1 in draft dollars 
@Skimmer I’m legitimately worried about your physical and mental health 
@Skimmer I’m not required to disclose for whom I voted 
@Skimmer If you have any semblance of pride for yourself, you will refuse to acknowledge that Goody played any role in your championship. Otherwise I will fail to acknowledge your win and you will become the disputed champion. 
@Skimmer ignoring me and Darrow in the PoGo GroupMe has me feeling some type of way 
@Skimmer I'm still waiting to hear about the status of your butthole 
@Skimmer investigate any more dead bodies on the side of the highway

@Skimmer Let’s talk about the game 
@Skimmer lol
@Skimmer Looks like you could use a new tight end. Could I interest you in Jimmy Graham? 
@Skimmer Looks like you need some Carson Wentz in your life with Luck concussed. Since it's a seller's market, I'll take Julio Jones and Le'Veon Bell off your hands. 
@Skimmer mind you that this was 5 years ago, but when I worked in my high school tech department, we we're still using floppy discs to image computer labs 
@Skimmer miss you

@Skimmer need a Photoshop with Russ's face in a broncos hat/Jersey 
@Skimmer no gym today. First day in clinic, so I wasn't on campus to use the gym. Back at it tomorrow 
@Skimmer on a scale of 1 to Darrow's pants at Marcus's rehearsal dinner, how tight is your butthole
@Skimmer On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my aforementioned legal argument?

@Skimmer thanks for the gift 
@Skimmer this is the moment that I quit my quest for improved health

@Skimmer while you're here, tell me about your best ball addiction

"@The Big Dick Bandit  ""Chris Simms instantly recognized the Super Bowl XXI ring that Belichick won as defensive coordinator of the Giants (Simms’ father, Phil, has one). On Belichick’s right hand was last year’s ring won by the Patriots, their sixth. The last one isn’t one of the other Patriots’ rings, and Belichick’s spokespeople are remaining mum on the subject.

If it’s a Super Bowl ring, the only other ring it could be would be the Super Bowl XXV ring, won in one of the all-time upsets when the Giants beat the Bills, 20-19."""

@The Big Dick Bandit  I don't think Joe even eats that gourmet
@The Big Dick Bandit  I found an answer to the question you asked yesterday. Basically, the House can impeach before Biden is sworn in. Pundits are speculating that they will delay transmission of the impeachment articles to the Senate until Biden takes office, because it is the Senate majority that determines the rules of the trial. Even though Trump would be out of office then, the trial can still occur in the senate.

@The Big Dick Bandit I demand 2 extra points this week plus I should be refunded any points that Chiefs D gives up on this drive 
@The Big Dick Bandit I didn't know you were a Spurs fan
@The Big Dick Bandit I do not have my schedule for next year yet and can't commit to any of these dates
@The Big Dick Bandit I don’t have specific examples but I’ve watched a lot of games where I’ve questioned his use of the bullpen, or questioned why he’s pinch hit players in certain situations. Just reading back to some stuff about the 2013 World Series, in game 3 (which they lost), he chose to have Brandon Workman bat in the 9th instead of doing a double switch, leaving Napoli on the bench 
@The Big Dick Bandit I gave my pick to Joe. It's your responsibility to take it over from him 
@The Big Dick Bandit I got rejected from Mt. Sinai this morning

@The Big Dick Bandit I know it's only preseason, but apparently Marcus Cannon stuffed JJ Watt into a box at practice yesterday. 
@The Big Dick Bandit I miss the new gaming gulag. Please return it to existence 
@The Big Dick Bandit I picked up those pokeballs from the stops at Kendall while I was waiting for your lazy ass to take the elevator downstairs 
@The Big Dick Bandit I said that they've been birthing themselves for centuries. Those data only include one century and a few extra years worth of information. Find me a graph that goes as far back as the 1200s
@The Big Dick Bandit I still don’t know what today is 
@The Big Dick Bandit I suggest not answering anyone other questions without involving league counsel 
@The Big Dick Bandit I think I heard something about some sort of event,  but I can’t quite remember 
@The Big Dick Bandit I think it's pretty clear that if extra security was wanted, it would have been there 
@The Big Dick Bandit I think that I proved that I am the most loyal Fuckhole #RIPDovin
@The Big Dick Bandit I think the move there is just to vacuum in the middle of the night and then yell at your roommates for not helping 
@The Big Dick Bandit I think you'd really like the new Radiolab podcast. Ignoring the preview of a different podcast at the beginning. It's all about checks and balances with nuke launches 
@The Big Dick Bandit I usually watch the fourth quarter of super bowl victories on repeat
@The Big Dick Bandit I will be in Stowe

@The Big Dick Bandit if you were a true rich, you would just burn your shirts after a single wash and buy new, reasonably priced shirts from Ross 
@The Big Dick Bandit If you work for americorps, you qualify for food stamps
@The Big Dick Bandit IIRC, that comment was made after I took the initiative to help the league out by hosting a zoom call. Smh

@The Big Dick Bandit my "friend" would like to know how you get a penis large enough to necessitate double pump jerking. I was born with an extremely large penis so I told him I couldn't help him but thought maybe you would know 
@The Big Dick Bandit my birthday was fine. I had emr training in the morning and then was in clinic til 730. Had unhealthy Chinese food and cake, opened a few presents, fell asleep at like 1030 
@The Big Dick Bandit my med school friends are having an argument. One of them is saying that a grilled cheese means that you only have cheese and bread; if you put anything else in the sandwich, that makes it a melt. The other one disagrees and says that a grilled cheese is anything with bread, cheese, and your choice of filling. Can you ask your cousin what his take on this is?
@The Big Dick Bandit my opinion is that I have not seen any concrete data to suggest that it's beneficial. That's not to say that the data don't exist, I just personally have not looked. At first I assumed that this was a stupid Facebook-generated thing but it seems to have support of some of the physicians I follow
@The Big Dick Bandit my weekend was very nice. Thanks for asking 
@The Big Dick Bandit never doubted me

@The Big Dick Bandit orange line since it goes right to Tufts 
@The Big Dick Bandit Patient gets billed. Either patient pays, or hospital eats the cost, with the caveat that there are funds that many hospitals have access to that help cover the cost. I believe that blanket is from government 
@The Big Dick Bandit pink lady is also a very good type of apple 
@The Big Dick Bandit please don't be mean to my good friend @#JustFacts✅

@The Big Dick Bandit Robert Kraft gets married in your city and you can't obtain and share that info to the GroupMe in advance?
@The Big Dick Bandit school is sending me to San Diego for a conference in November. I'm staying one block away from a Fogo de Chao
@The Big Dick Bandit she's going to be devastated. First you don't tell her about your engagement, now this. 
@The Big Dick Bandit should I buy a shirt from TB12 or from JE11? I was thinking of getting the #BetAgainstUs shirt since everyone counted us out all year 
@The Big Dick Bandit so now he has a bad back and a bad heart? So many excuses
@The Big Dick Bandit so you gunna push that Bortles trade through? 
@The Big Dick Bandit So you’re admitting to skimming my message 
@The Big Dick Bandit some residency programs, like Bock's and mine, allow you to fill shifts in other roles for extra pay. It's usually hourly or per shift pay and usually the pay is good. Under those circumstances, the malpractice insurance that the hospital buys for us would cover us in these roles, even though they may be slightly out of our general scope. Some other programs allow external moonlighting, where insurance may not follow you 
@The Big Dick Bandit sorry for your loss 
@The Big Dick Bandit speaking of business school applications, what are you doing with your life?

@The Big Dick Bandit thanks for your help packing. You've been a lifesaver 
@The Big Dick Bandit that makes sense. Thank you for keeping me informed
@The Big Dick Bandit That son of a bitch Chan never photoshopped us into the avacado toast picture 
@The Big Dick Bandit that's a great crew 
@The Big Dick Bandit that's a great question, Tony. The way I see it, there are two options. Either you could give Cam a chance to play out the season to woo another team, or you put Studham out there to see what he can do. Really, it boils down to one of those two decisions 
@The Big Dick Bandit THATS THE WRONG FUCKING MARBLE LEAGUE YOU DIMWITTED FUCK
@The Big Dick Bandit things are much less depressing when you get to spend a few hours on a video chat with da boiz
@The Big Dick Bandit This was a catch 
@The Big Dick Bandit thoughts about what the Pats do with LT? Solder coming back would be huge, had a good year overall now that he’s healthy again, but he has a provision where he can’t be tagged and the market so thin, I’m afraid he’s going to get overpaid 
@The Big Dick Bandit Thoughts on most recent US massacre? 
@The Big Dick Bandit To answer your question about Serial, Adnan got a new trial because the cell tower expert was not given a cover sheet to the cell records that stated their limitations and how they should be used. He's since spoken out against his testimony and said that he would never have said what he said on the stand if he had all of the information about the records. And since the cell tower records were what convicted Adnan, the judge ordered his sentence vacated

@The Big Dick Bandit what if the Pats call dibs on Trevor Lawrence. Then he has to fall to their pick, right?

@The Big Dick Bandit when does the second half start?
@The Big Dick Bandit When is my rematch with Kovin 
@The Big Dick Bandit When is the league vote on implementing my scoring?

@The Big Drake Bandit I keep getting ads for the Billustration hat and I don’t really understand what it is but it’s 🔥
@The Big Drake Bandit I’m not saying it, but I’ve heard criticism that you, as the highest ranking administrator in this GroupMe, have allowed racists to have a platform to continue to spew their bigotry. How would you respond?

@The Duk (🖕🏻-_-)🖕🏻
@The Duk I haven't talked to any of them so I can't confirm or deny the presence of accents. @Sultan of Stamford Olivia's sister just moved out here. They did a rode trip from Boston to LA so I'm taking a little vacation 
@The Duk I noticed it on my close Pokemon when I was sitting in my apartment. I left my apartment and turned right. Spent 10 minutes around only to have it be four houses down to the left of me 
@The Duk Is PokeGoBoston down for good? I can't access it 
@The Duk Watch your back next time you get close to a ledge. I think Darrow is trying to make you fail so he can take the money 
@The Duk Where are our post-draft power rankings?
@The Duk Where is your new apartment going to be?
@The Duke Can you post the link to the site that you use to find IV's again?
@The Duke Come to Davis Square, sit in the park and wait for people to come and tell you that there is a rare Pokemon down the street. 
@The Duke Fuck you Kovin, Emyr is the Pokemon master and even he doesn't have a pinsir
@The Duke I liked Bioshock infinite's story the best. But I have to say, I loved Rapture. And I didn't think 2 was as bad as you all seem to think, but definitely the worst of the three 
@The Fucking Man I wonder if the MFA has a good Pokemon spawn rate
@The Fucking Man If you come to Davis, there was a gengar, a Pinsor (sp?), a nidorhino, a jigglypuff, and a seal. Only found the gengar

@The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) Since I know you won't skim, can you explain to me how Israel, a very small country, has the manpower to carry on two wars at the same time?

@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD as a radiologist, how angry do you get when someone tries to say that modern IV contrast contributes to clinically significant contrast nephropathy 
@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD as Goody informed me, the rule states you cannot block someone back towards your own end zone.

@Two-Time Looking to plan a domestic vacation in July before med school. Something ~5 days that involves some outdoor activity that won't kill me or be in 110 degree heat. Where would you recommend
@Two-Time Olivia says "of course the Fuckholes can stay at my house if they want, but it has to be one of my off weekends so I can be there, because my parents probably wouldn't want a group of random people staying there without me there. Also, I can't get discounted tickets"
@Two--Time Plz respond. 
@Two-Time What resources do I need to survive a hike in Washington?
@Two-Time When Kloee sells for a billion, you should be a booster for the football program and start buying sports cars for all the recruits

“We, the AHANA+ Leadership Council (ALC), condemn the racist incidents that occurred on Saturday, January 31st and again yesterday night on the third floor of Xavier Hall, a Multicultural Learning Experience,” the statement reads. “ … Unfortunately, the executive administration of UGBC has failed to provide a meaningful response to the vile acts that cultivated this weekend, and have not effectively outlined or implemented ways to unify our community and make campus a safe space for all students.”"

1) Definitely increased testing has resulted in increased # of cases. 2) At least in MA, there is a huge issue at nursing homes. Also a lot of the people infected are people who work essential service jobs and cannot distance themselves. Surgical and cloth masks are not adequate to prevent the spread of the virus. Plus there is potential for a long incubation period, up to 2 weeks in some reports, so potentially new cases were people exposed in mid-April who are just getting tested now

1) He called Mexican immigrants "rapists" who are "bringing crime" to the US. 2) He said a judge with Mexican heritage wasn't fit to oversee his case. Paul Ryan condemned these comments as "textbook definition of racism." 3) While he might have ONE TIME said that nazis were bad, he has also Tweeted to encourage white supremacist action several times during his presidency. He has retweeted messages from neo-Nazis previously. 4) He tweeted a picture of Hilary with the Star of David and a pile of money. 5) After Charlottesville, white supremacists came out and praised Trump for "defending the truth."

1) The pandemic has really messed things up. 2) Depolicing led to more violence. 3) Lack of trust in police led to more violence. 4) More guns led to more gun violence. 5) Overwhelmed hospitals led to more deaths. 6) Idle hands led to more violence. 7) A bad economy led to more violence.
1) There is no evidence that more frequent testing yields any benefit. 2) People who are younger have better outcomes, but that isn't universal. Black players also have higher rates of asthma and sickle cell disease/trait, making them more likely to have negative outcomes. 3) You are narrowing in on players, but what about the coaches and employees that of older age and are super likely to be hospitalized and/or die compared to younger people? 4) Not everyone is going to get sick at one time. The wide receiver room may all get sick and be quarantined one week, but the next it might be the defensive backs, etc. To say that the worst case scenario is forfeiting 2 games is really underselling this.
"1) there isn't a lot of blowback about manning because no one cares, which is a huge double standard

4 years of medical school. The first two years are generally spent in the classroom, the last two are spent rotating in different clerkships in the hospital outpatient setting. During your fourth year, you interview for and are matched into a residency program. Residency is minimum 3 years depending on your specialty. From there, you can sub-specialize and do a fellowship which can be another 1 to 3 or 4 years

6 million people in New York. 10% take taxis to work between 7 am and 10 am.

Back in 1989, he ran an ad in the paper saying to bring back the death penalty in response their arrest. 11) In a book from the 1990s, Trump is quoted by saying that a black employee was lazy, but that wasn't his fault because it is a trait "in blacks."

79% of overtime games since the rule was changed in 2011 (only adopted for playoffs) and 2012 (adopted for all games) have not ended after the first or second possession. Meaning only 21% of games end on the first or second possession of overtime #onlyfacts
79% of the time since 2011 playoffs, overtime games were not won on the first or second possession. How can you argue against facts?

A lot of people who attempt suicide and fail do so with less-than-immediately-lethal means and thus are more likely to survive and receive therapy. Those who attempt with firearms are obviously less likely to survive.

In a panic the man rushes his beloved carrot to the veterinarian. The man is in the waiting room pacing back and forth when finally the vet comes out of surgery. He tells the man "I have good news and bad news. The good news is your pet has made it through surgery and will live. The bad news is he will be a vegetable for the rest of his life."

A patient can sue a hospital or provider if they believe their protected health information was disseminated inappropriately. Also, the mere fact that Maz left out the patients name doesn’t exclude him from violating HIPAA. Any information that could like a person to a condition is a HIPAA violation. I could post about treating a gunshot victim in my ED, and even if I leave the name out of my post, someone may know the victim or maybe the news reports on the shooting. Either way, I could have just disseminated information illegally to my whole newsfeed

Again, *theoretically* addressed by the ACA. The ACA built the marketplaces where people unable to get insurance through their employer could purchase insurance.

Again, I will be in maple country 
Again, I would be shocked if the majority of football fans didn't agree with me 
Again, I'm not trying to bring the NFL to college football. I understand everything you're saying about scheduling and the lack of parity and the limitations of a conference. I fundamentally disagree that people voting behind closed doors is a more objective way of selecting playoff teams. Tell me why auto-bids work in other college sports but not football? Because the tournament have more teams in them? If that's the argument, I can understand that. I just don't see the true value in having a conference championship if it is not a big factor in whether a team advances to the postseason or not
Again, I'm relatively uninformed as well, but that's my opinion. I haven't had an actual conversation with healthcare providers about this, but would love to 
Again, it's not about the pats losing

Reeeeeallly wish someone took a minute to ask the question before jumping to conclusions, but I guess that's the product of heightened tension in our society. Plus he has become the scapegoat from many NASCAR fans that aren't okay with the current changes, so maybe his team was overhyped about what things could possibly happen to him

He also says that HGH was mailed to Peyton manning's wife for Peyton and that Peyton came in after hours for infusions, but no one really knows if this dude is just bullshitting or not

It is standard for posts on the UGBC Instagram account to be released by the UGBC Community Relations Committee, she said.

“It came to my attention that Christian had produced the statement entirely on his own and uploaded the statement entirely on his behalf,” Katz said. “However, it didn’t seem that way to the outside viewer, as this statement seemed to be speaking on behalf of the entire organization when in reality a large portion of the organization was not consulted before this information was released.”"

All 3 people would have been going wild
All 3000 of them will be so sad
All are welcome, or we can go to Bocker's. really honestly doesn't matter to me. I need to stop and get snacks on my way home if you're all coming over p
All because he "didn't want to waste the last few sips" 
All because of his gambling addiction 
All Bethesda games suck because they slow down your walking when your pack gets full
All bets should be documented in the betting groupme to retain more organization
All children are betas regardless of RSV

All day baby. Right up the seam to waste 10 seconds

All four for teddy bridgewater?
All Goodwin power rankings are invalid. 
All hail the path 
All he has to do is sort by best rated...
All heroin is basically fentanyl or synthesized fentanyl these days. Then again, a lot of pills are cut with fentanyl too. Basically everything is fentanyl 
All I ask is that you please let us know when you're too busy for us 
All I can say is holy ballz
All I can say is it's nice to see the Broncos win without having to see Flacco win
All I can see is a striking resemblance to Big Fundamental
All I care about is beating Joe 
All I care about is being present to celebrate my good friends 
All I care is that everyone goes to the polls. Goody is in a blue state anyway so his vote doesn't matter if he votes Republican 
All I do all shift when I am in the peds ED call psych for some 13 year old who thinks they want to die because school is stressful
All I gather from that is that the Pac12 is twice as good as the SEC 
All I have heard is that BB is running a Shanahan offense this year and how we are going to ball out
All I have is this score 
All I heard was about was his strength playing toward the sideline 
All I know is if the change ever moves to ncaa, bc is fucked 
All I know is stuff you need a prescription for 
All I know is that amber rose said Kanye likes butt stuff so Kanye lost 
All I know is that he sure knows how to lose in Catan #PeoplesChamp 
All I know is that he's either going to be cut in two weeks or he's going to play 90% of snaps like Akeem Ayers did after they traded for him in 2014
All I know is that I can't fall asleep without choking the chicken to Joe's gorgeous face each night. 
All I know is that I heard how the bills dline was going to tear the pats to shreds and the closest they came to Brady was the post game handshake. I heard that the jets secondary was impenetrable and Brady threw two td's and should have had a third (against revis) but Edelman dropped it. Broncos d is great and will be a tough test but more often than not, I watch BB and TB12 figure out some way to exploit a weakness. And who knows who gets hurt between then and now 
All I know is that they're marching from the Reggie Lewis center to the common, I don't know of any other matches 
All I need is big ben or carr to be credited one more yard
All I said was that Elon is a butt face. That's hardly political 
All I saw was a nidorino but couldn't tap it before it disappeared. Going 80 mph doesn't help 
All I see from Darrow is a lot of talk and no action
All I see on CNN is Hillary talking about how Americans can handle the truth about UFOs and how Sanders thinks that GE is ruining America 
All I want for Christmas is for the Vikings coaching staff to realize that McKinnon is better than Murray 
All I want is Goodell to go all "HEY, respect mah authoriteh and don't walk in front of the refs in the future"
All I want is my friend Joseph to be safe
All I want is people to not get arrested for smoking weed but people to get arrested if they shoot someone 
All I want is to see Americans win 
All I want to know is if @Skimmer found parking 
All I'm hearing is that Marcus is already writing Oklahoma off 
All I'm saying is that $6m for a healthy Marty B doesn't seem out of the Pats price range given the several pundits who predicted he'd fetch $8m or $9m
All is right in the world
All I've seen is him score a goal in intramural 
All MBA?

All of it
All of my space lasers are strictly non-denominational 
All of my wins were against teams who were at one point during the season in the top 3 of someone's arbitrary power rankings. Does that mean I make the playoffs too?
All of SA doesn't have a single fucking River? 
All of that doesn't matter but spewing facts means I win this argument. 
All of the Dems. Republicans are evil liars
All of those players are robbed from me

All of your friends are in here, so....
All Olivia cares about is being in Vermont and ignoring your relationship milestone 
All or none. No negotiation.

All the more reason why I don't want them to sweep us our first series at home 
All the power in your swing is supposed to come from your lower back anyway 
All the proof you need, right there. 
All the pundits on Twitter making the annual joke that they have a perfect mock draft so far 
All the real ones were
All the Republicans will sit in a room and vote on a new speaker and when they choose one, white smoke will come out of the chimney on top of the Capitol and the new speaker will dawn white robes and a large hat, then will address the masses in front of the Capitol to announce his or her new reign 
All the stories mentioned today are verbatim how they happened 
All the street vendors can't sell 
All these buildings make it really hard for@Skimmer 
All they need is to just play the audio clip from "here comes the pizza" at the top of every inning 
All they needed to do was block Chris Jones

Almost everyone here did a good job today 
Almost like you shouldn't fire the best coach of all time and bring in a replacement with no head coaching experience without an interview process

Alright I confirmed for six people at 4 pm. They don't take reservations more than six. I figure we can remove a few people from the reservation if no one else decides they can come 
Alright that makes sense. I just read what you were saying wrong. Thanks for the clarification brah 
Alright, Marcus...
Alright. But it's kind of weird having Joe there... 
Alright. I'm convinced. Now I have published evidence to reference for all future arguments. 
ALS blows. That's all I have to add 
ALSHON JEFFREY
Alshon Jeffrey ❤️
Alshon loses value. Aaron Jones gains oodles of value. I am clairvoyant
Alshon says he took a supplement that contained a banned substance. Doesn't the NFL tell players what supplements they can and cannot take?

Also am I supposed to know what his company does? 
Also an alpha
Also an issue, according to the indictment, after Brooks was shot, one of the cops kicked him and the other stood on his shoulder and neglected to provide aid for several minutes. Regardless of anything that happened up until that point, those actions are pretty dehumanizing
Also any fevers? Does it happen after meals? Anything specific that triggers the cramps?
Also any meat that comes from a pig 
Also apparently unclever isn't a word. Mind blown 
Also apparently, Stowe has banned the practice because several people got lost and racked up thousands of dollars in costs trying to rescue them. There used to be a groomed trail that was well maintained between the two resorts but it's no longer groomed, but crazy people still do it 
Also are we just going to let Chan off the hook? I don't have any evidence, but isn't it suspicious that maybe he's thrown games before?
Also as had as BB
Also as I am reading more now, it seems that the pause is just a recommendation right now and the feds are leaving it up to states to decide whether to actually pause or not

Also Brady yelling at the sideline for changing the play was hilarious 
Also bullshit that you can advance after security is literally blocking Nunez, even if he could get up 
Also burkhead is bad at football 
Also by posting a graphic from ESPN 
Also can argue for more support of businesses but I don't want to open that pandora's box
Also can people stop going to Vermont and murdering my future family 
Also can we change the location from my apartment to Joe's house? I'm going to be hanging out with Mr. Bourque all day and I'd feel bad if I just ditched him for the draft 
Also can we move the day? I work until 1am in NY the day before and 7am the next day. Also can we move it to Vermont?
Also canceling the butt chugging station and the petting zoo 
Also can't imagine getting stuck in traffic for 30 minutes so the pres can go get an ice cream cone (I assume that's all he does these days) 
Also can't wait for Morcus to come in to pump the tires of the assistant AD from Temple

Also didn’t see the google search. I skimmed that Snapchat. What was it 
Also didn't hear the whole Trapped in The Closet
Also didn't like how we had three teams and never really interacted with each other 
Also didn't look smart in real time 
Also didn't think it was a joke
Also Disney Land is far inferior to Disney world
Also do you see what Herbert is doing on defense right now??
Also Doctor Oz reported it, according to Google. I take back what I said. It makes no sense. Fuck Dr. Oz
Also doctors are required to complete CMEs every year and theoretically be reviewing the medications used to treat diseases in their field 
Also does anyone pay attention to the Santa Monica pier when Pokevision first loads up? No fucking drowzees or pidgeys anywhere 
Also does say forward on bc's website. BCI lies. ESPN lies. 
Also does that study take into account the fact that many primary care physician often dictate notes and catch up on work at home during the evenings/weekends? 
Also doing away with income-based premiums and moving towards age based premiums, which would limit affordability for older adults with lower incomes 
Also don't know how you call a run up the A gap with a stacked box on 4th and inches
Also don't know how you don't design an 8 yard hot route to hit when they bring the house. There was so much space to catch and run 
Also don't know that any of those had 45 million daily users a month after its release 
Also don't let anyone tell you that the N95 shortage isn't real. Olivia got hers from a nurse who brought them in from home after a friend donated them. She's reused it for the last several shifts. Now she finally has another one that my parents' neighbor dropped off today. The hospital hasn't been able to provide her a single mask
Also DPI
Also drank lots of beers 
Also due to weight room and facilities

Also from what Twitter says, some protesters in Boston started throwing bottles tonight, and were arrested, and the protests have calmed again. But there are apparently protests in Brockton with more fireworks being thrown at cops
Also fuck 
Also fuck @#JustFacts✅ 
Also fuck @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs

Also fuck Gregg Doyle 
Also fuck you and your team Kevin 
Also fuck you chan, he was interfered with. How your left over Anna's gives you bloody diarrhea. 
Also fuckhole 
Also fun fact, 5% of worldwide Corona cases are in the NYC region. Get fucked goody
Also FWIW, after reading a new article, the police chief walked back claims of extorting businesses. It also seems like the protesters in CHAZ have tried to turn it into a community of sorts. A quote I saw was a "mix between Occupy Wall Street and a college campus"
Also games that end in ties like the spain portugal match are not worth watching
Also gluten
Also going to try to go to snoqualmie falls, which seems like a pretty good time 
Also good
Also good thing that the researcher behind those data no longer works for Yale and is a professor on the Tufts undergrad campus
Also good to see that the Brazilian president saying that the Covid vaccine will turn you into an alligator didn't affect public support by more than a few percent 
Also goody 
Also goody works in Cambridge and I work right across the river. 
Also goody, Darrowball just fucking torched your ass. You don't come back from something like that 
Also goody, kovin and John were also in eagle ems 
Also gottem

Also great job not tagging me 
Also great job throwing into triple coverage and getting your guy murdered 
Also Greg Schiano to Pats as DC
Also GroupMe dead
Also has sushi
Also has taken four punts back for touchdowns in his career. 🐐
Also have you asked them about their office thermostat policies 
Also he got a lot of flack for how he handled the Orioles situation this year and there is a report that he blew up at Pomeranz earlier in the season and that didn’t go over well with Dombrowski
Also he is just 90% of the time
Also heard good things about Posto but they don't have any gf options so I've never been
Also heard rumors that bears have been spotted hibernating in there. Can neither confirm or deny 
Also heard that on weei around when Ortiz released his video about retirement 
Also Hearts
Also Hi
Also Hightower is a piece of shit 
Also his responsibility is clearly the EDGE who dropped to the flat
Also how bout that humblebrag
Also how important are you that you're writing letters for the CEO
Also how is this affected by the giant heads coming and transporting earth to a different galaxy to participate in a song competition
Also how much local tax fits in your ass
Also I ain't a bitch so I drink lactose free milk and the supply is plentiful 
Also I am definitely not the only one that gave guesses for others before those people had time to guess
Also I am definitely out regardless of time.
Also I can confirm that chicks dig melted candle vibes
Also I claimed it was a 10 minute walk to the south end, which is far closer than the restaurant that you selected 
Also I denounce the coach, the AD, and the university president 
Also I don't think "a possible TB12 mindset" has been studied in a rigorous RCT
Also I guess Daniel Jones sucks again
Also I have to agree with Morcus that the CDC really shot itself in the foot for months with the response to COVID. Since they originally came out with inaccurate guidance, they have been pretty silent. Now they are pushing pro-masking guidance, which is almost certainly the correct way to go based on the evidence thus far, but I agree that their original stances really confused the situation 
Also I have to work tomorrow and Sunday
Also I hope LCA is feeling better after you tried to kill her 
Also I just want them to send me my next check
Also I personally don't think Tiger has been very influential outside of the sport of golf, but I know Bocker is going to fight me on that.
Also I saw conflicting reports. Some news reports are saying he was the shooter. Others are saying he was the driver of the get away motorcycle 
Also I thought Warner just snapped Gibbs's arm backwards 
Also I was not good
Also I was thinking today about how @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) has posted more from WW3 than @Skimmer 
Also I will have extra food if you need something, Joseph. Don't want you going hungry 
Also I’m sorry your friend is a poor who can’t live in a real neighborhood like Manhattan or New Jersey 
also if anyone saw the last preseason game, Sexy Rexy 2.0 looked amazing 
Also if Hilton is hurt from that makes four injuries this week for Emyr and Jordan 
Also if the rankings were random, how did the Pablo Sanchez vs. Pablo Sandoval matchup in the first round happen???
also if you ask me
Also I'm assuming that I can just cancel this if I lose 
Also I'm definitely eating dinner at 4 pm, playing some penny slots, then going to bed at 8:30 
Also I'm fat haha
Also I'm not going into a specialty so I'm not a piece of shit. Get your facts straight 
Also imagine not watching football and instead watching some 5th rate golf tournament 
Also IMDB
Also in
Also in
Also in 
Also in Rhode Island 
Also in that draft, Christian ponder, Andy dalton, Colin Kaepernick, Ryan mallet, tj Yates, tyrod Taylor
Also in the morning and at lunch time 
Also invest more resources and funding in preventative care 
Also Iran has been cleared by international inspectors every year since the deal was made 
Also is annoying Patriots chick going to be there 
Also is BB a genius for drafting Duggar and rescuing Peppers off of the scrap pile? 
Also it couldn't have been that fun if you aren't less than a half hour there 
Also it does not factor in the fact that I have had terrible experiences sharing walls with people in my last 3 apartments and I am fucking ready to not deal with that this
Also it still confuses me how every statement regarding Gronk has to come from both the Patriots and the Gronkowski family. You didn't see Gisele issuing joint statements with the Pats during deflategate 
Also it was a throwback not on Thursday 
Also it would decrease healthcare spending 🤔
Also it's $20/person. I can pay now and have everyone pay me back or pay when we all get there 
Also it's hard to predict injuries and decline in talent, so I don't feel like teams should have to hold on to bad contracts if people are performing poorly. If I Goody sexually harasses someone again and gets fired for the fourth time, he won't get paid the remainder of his contract 
Also it's my security deposit on the apartment so the faster she moves out, the faster I can have the landlord give me my money back 
Also it's racist 
Also I've decided to become a squatter in my hotel room. They can't kick me out if I never leave
Also I've seen several reports that the DoD and pentagon were blindsided by this. Another example of policy being driven by tweets and not by actual discussion and facts 
Also Jakobi Meyers is legit. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
Also JC Jackson is very bad 
Also jfc Gibson
Also Joe 
Also Joe buck is a pretty busy dude this time of year
Also Joe, the last time Palmer signed a contract extension with the bengals, he tore the same acl 
Also John, Olivia wants you to know that you are always welcome to go to her house in Stowe to go skiing 
Also Jordan hates him so any ill-will towards him is warranted because Jordan is an American hero.
also jordan, do your coworkers a favor and call out of work tomorrow. If you do have a virus, it's really contagious and you don't want to go ruining people's weekends 
Also Jordan, what's your pee level for the country right now
Also Joseph randle got himself arrested again. I can't believe that being drafted by Joe has sent him into this bad of a downward spiral 
Also Josh Allen getting more than 229.5 passing yards would mean I hit on my 4 part parlay. 
Also Jurkovec out with a knee
Also just tackle the dude. That's fucking sad
Also just want everyone to know that the game is not on at this one year old’s birthday party
Also just want to say that my shooting form is one of my strongest basketball traits
also kickers
Also kinda lame that you had Mac Jones model it tbh
Also Kittle
Also known as 2012
Also known as the dark ages 
Also kovin has to study for step 2 which is apparently far more intense than step 1 considering bocker is on the beach right now 
Also Kovin never texted me the diagnosis of the shoulder MRI which means I was right
Also Landry
Also Las Vegas gambling degenerates
Also lazy 
Also Les Miles, but that’s a different situation 
Also likes to talk to himself 
Also listening to Olivia's family during the game is very hard for me. 
Also living
Also look at Kovin talking about the master race. No wonder he took german in college 
Also looks like Dr. Cox 
Also lose my number if you think that the Fuckholes wouldn't know if I was having a baby before I told anyone else. 
Also losers: the rest of the world that has to hear about how fucked the Middle East continues to be 
Also malaria 
Also Marcus has been typing for >10 minutes. 
Also Marcus is more upset about Bocker trying to censor free speech than he is about Bocker deep dicking his girl 
Also Mayo is bad. Kraft has sunk this franchise for years to come 
Also me
Also me 
Also med school 
Also meth 
Also Meyers >>>>> Harry. Don't @ me 
Also Michigan state got fucked over 
Also might be daredorm. I wouldn't trust it

Also Morcus rn (get it?!)
Also Morcus's life
Also more evidence of not stressing
Also my "gaming computer" is 6 years old and was middle market as it was when I bought it
Also my anus was tight 
Also my boss runs the infusion center in our department for kids with IBD who need drug infusions. They write off thousands and thousands of dollars in losses every month from insurance companies just refusing to pay for infusions that they already approved to happen 
Also my child is perfect and would never need medical care
Also my final answer is a team of Jamie Collins. 
Also my least favorite character on lost 
Also my opinion
Also my own plumbing
Also my team is dogshit for unrelated reasons 
Also need a bunson burner blow torch drop right there 
Also new cdc recommendations are to not test mildly symptomatic people or people who have known contacts. They only mandate testing for those sick enough for hospital treatment. Which seems really counterintuitive to me considering increased testing is now coming online and testing everyone possible was how China and South Korea successfully contained the virus
Also Newtown was fake 
Also NH and MA had by far the worst roads compared to VT and RI
Also nice typos Anthony
Also nick perrotta?
Also no 
Also no longer alive, hence "was"
Also no posts from goody. He probably didn't even stay up to watch the game 
Also not a relevant hypothetical since I said I wouldn't take the SAT again
Also not adopting the rule placing cameras along the sidelines and endzone to ensure that the correct call is made every time 
Also not having outside OL depth 
Also not to joke about a shooting, but I wonder how this impacts republican opinion on gun laws 
Also noticed that no one thought that they needed an apple expert during a picking outing today
Also now
Also now I’m looking up recipes and I found this dank quinoa with herb, shallot, and bacon recipe 
Also now waking up in the morning feeling like pdiddy
Also NSFW
Also occasions
Also Olivia called chop suey "American goulash" 
Also Olivia can attest that I have always been a big swiftie. When 1989 came out, Olivia was driving around a shit box green VW that probably was giving us CO poisoning and we used to listen to the album on repeat as the fumes slowly killed us 
Also on
Also on choking
Also on the hunt for some prime deals. Hook a brother up if you find anything, goody 
Also one of the specialties that has a condescending name. Just call yourself an ear nose and throat doctor 
Also only 52 missed messages in 3 days is fucking weak
Also only 59 ICU patients and only 30 currently intubated
Also our best guess is that being infected with COVID confers immunity for a matter of months, not years or decades like some other illnesses 
also out
Also out*
Also paid* 
Also pan sear*. Not winning any typing contests tonight 
Also patriots are probably losing their long snapper
Also people think he sucked last year so we should trade him this year if he isn't good 
Also per urban dictionary

Also please tell Taylor that the Hotels say "happy birthday"
Also pretty fucked that NESN didn’t get to broadcast this game
Also pretty sure @Beanboy never confirmed that he was alive
Also probably don't need to punch people who are already in cuffs. That's the police's job 
Also probably nosy since they allegedly bug their locker room 
Also proven hater of women 
Also q tips aren't for your ears. Also, also, I easily double that physicians recommendation on a daily basis 
Also QB play and playcalling has gotten more suspicious as the season has drawn on. Dillon is banged up and the backfield could probably benefit from a rotation between Dillon and Levy.
Also r/mlbstreams 
Also read somewhere that Hyde was going to the Browns but I haven’t had time to confirm that 
Also really bad for IT a year before free agency. This will scare teams away 
Also recently engaged apparently
Also reply back with a Guatemalan rug pick to assert dominance. 
Also reports that Mike Glennon going to get $14-$15 mil. What planet is this?!
Also represents one of the Kavanaugh accusers
Also resign Matt Lengel, which is obviously a big deal 
Also RI allows carts and MA doesn't 
Also Ricky hasn't called me in a few weeks. Just hoping he's ok with that friend-thief Kevin around 
also rioting
Also ruining
Also running mesh against zone is dumb
Also runs 
Also said he was going to run at combine. Didn't. Said he was going to run at pro day. Didn't. Said he was going to run at private workout. Didn't. 
Also saying that you are on trial makes me think that you are the defendant 
Also Scam Newton's contract includes just $550k guaranteed. New Pats cap number is $260k.
Also Schefter says town Achilles for foster 
Also seems like there are a lot of bus stops. Uber's have been fine as well 
Also seriously, does Kovin live in Europe now? 
Also she didn't even buy the tickets. Her and her friend Kerri got fucked by ticketmaster. But Kerri's coworker got tickets, then was able to get back in line and get more for Kerri, but could only get 3 (they were aiming for 5)
Also Siemian didn't actually break his ankle. Just some torn ligaments. 
Also snapface
Also some data that virus mutated and is causing more severe disease in Italy/US than China
Also some people in here said mean things about his wife in the past
Also somehow 
Also SPOILERS
Also Stephenson is getting cut 
Also Steve bannon got added to the national securities council, and the joint chief of staffs and director of national intelligence were removed, so that's a thing 
Also still have never had this "posts aren't loading" issue 
Also still waiting for @Jamie Bourque to defend kirk cousins 
Also studied abroad in Barcelona
Also stupid that a turnover on downs has to be challenged
Also superfan
Also surprised none of you tried to fuck me over by picking up spencer ware for when Jamaal Charles doesn't play. This league has gone soft 
also switch out Chiefs D for someone else 
Also team #JustFacts✔️
Also team meetings and team press conference cancelled today..........
Also technically neither Morcus (unless he is paying with cash) nor I own homes until closing
Also tell me why you're hitting that dab pen. Too many chemicals in that shit. 
Also tell Taylor happy birthday 
Also that brie and pear dish from the most recent episode looked 💯💯💯
Also that dude that the pats had for a while who decided to pursue track. Demps?
Also that dude's drive was bad 
Also that food looks really good for being gluten free 
Also that guy is an idiot. Has he never flown? Why does he have precheck? 
Also that joke was A+. 
Also that just shows your mental fragility
Also that penis clearly has two descended testicles. That cannot be your penis Marcus 
Also that Ryan kid too 
Also that sucks. But also saving that guap 
Also that was DPI
Also that's a tight call for that spot of the game 
Also the abbreviation of the airport 
Also the ACLU obviously has already sued, as have several law professors
Also the animations are awful 
Also the ban has bipartisan support
Also the Browns have a rapist...I mean quarterback...sorry, slip of the tongue 
Also the buccs traded up to pick the kicker from Florida state in the second round?
Also the Bucks
Also the bum 
Also the CFL already had their grey cup 
Also the change hasn't been reflected in my HR account so I may not actually be paid for my 10 hours of sitting here 
Also the deed to all of Kristen's properties 
Also the dude shot up 3 different locations. Seems like maybe you could get a cop or two there in time before he left the third place?
also the groupme
Also the lack of cajones to not run a fake punt run on 4th down
Also the MAC
Also the most likely to currently have dementia 
Also the multicultural floor is contiguous with the other floors in CLXF, and was the only floor with any damage/harassment. I obviously was not there to judge the actions, but the news that has been reported is pretty much in agreement that it was racially motivated
also the new place*
Also the number of Seeders/Leachers is generally a good estimate of how safe the file is. If it's a safe file, it will be more popular than others with fewer Seeders and Leachers
Also the physician I do research for was supposed to conference me in to a meeting that started at 9. He confirmed this with me via text at 8:45. I'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs waiting for a call.
Also the promised land 
Also the Seahawks are miserably bad on offense 
Also the super league had rotators 
Also the team that "got first" last night was definitely cheating. I don't know for sure, but I am also saying that they didn't donate to charity. It is in the GroupMe so it is true.
Also the whole offsides thing on every drive doesn't help
Also there are massive multi-center studies working on this in the US right now. 
Also there are med schools that have completely med student run clinics that provide care to uninsured, poverty stricken, homeless individuals. I'm thinking of Drexel Med specifically. I guess they subscribe to the #KelleherPlan
Also there are reports that the cabinet is meeting to seriously consider the 25th 
Also there was an outbreak in the swimming and diving team and people were saying that the team was still practicing and going to the dining hall and such 
Also these commercials are all terrible
Also they are Catholic, therefore their mission is profiting off of the religiosity and charity of others.
Also they didn't take the shelter in place orders very seriously, partly because the government was really bad about discussing the severity.
Also things like facial hair prevent a good seal
Also think their line replacing the best defensive lineman to ever live is a pretty cool subplot 
Also this
Also this Bama qb sucks 
Also this game is horrible 
Also this is A+
Also this is going exactly how I expected Patriots free agency to go. Lose everyone, amass compensatory picks, resign mid to low tier guys on the cheap, wait til closer to the draft to pick swap for players on their 3rd or 4th year of their rookie deal. Rinse and repeat 
Also those data are not specific to births 
Also throw
Also TIL Kate Mara was in shooter 
Also to confirm, do you already have a trip planned to Wisconsin with other friends and are just trying to lump the Hotels into it only for us to show up to a weird Airbnb with 7 people we don’t know who all sing chorale songs all night?

Also UPenn. Fucking ivy league
Also v possible. 
Also very important
Also very legal
Also very much bothers me that you have Devin's name after his position 
Also veteran move Diggs to come back to catch that pass 
Also wanted to wait a few minutes to let the gravity of the moment sink in, but @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  "sorry to here that"
Also was driving and didn't see your message 
Also was really happy I got through security 1.5 hours before my flight. Got to stop for food. Ran into a friend and grabbed a drink. Showed up to my gate right when boarding started. Worked out great 
Also was this mailbox made out of platinum or something 
Also watching ESPN3. Looks horrible. Becker where on tv are you watching them?

Also why is he throwing a party with a dance stage if his parents were only out for a few hours
Also why were you up at 3 am? Were you also feeding a baby and changing a diaper?
Also why would you want to be CEO of Amazon? That sounds like a lame job 
Also will definitely not listen to this song ever again
Also will fill up the ERs with more accidental overdoses, limiting access to care for other people who need medical attention 
Also windmills cause cancer
Also windmills devalue homes by 75%
Also Winston replacing Fitzpatrick, and then fumbling to Mike Evans fucked over Jboss twice. Love it.
Also with me
Also wondering that 
Also would like to point out that I have already beaten Chan once this season. 
Also would prefer that we just run the ball every down from now on 
Also would support college football being a pro development league 
Also wouldn't have guessed the 1904 host 
Also ya boy nailed that interview and now has two mentors for his capstone 
Also yellow fever 
Also yes, I frequently say "your chest pain could be indigestion or your aorta could be ripping open and causing you to bleed into your chest" 
Also yes, please elaborate Nick 
Also you kind of have to put into perspective that they shaved 7-10 years of the development process.
Also you know you fucked up when Chris Christie is denouncing you on ABC 
Also you need a compressor which is pretty heavy and 
Also you never came to find me
Also you referred to the football team as the skins, which is not allowed
Also your bank information
Also your name
Also your residency is 1+4? 
Also your temperature preferences 
Also your use of acronyms 
Also your. It’s too early to type

Also you're from western mass 
Also yupo

Also*
Also, "elected"*
Also, "Orcarina"? Shame...
Also, #CancelYale is a thing now
Also, $19m guaranteed per report 
Also, @Anthony Goodwin forgot to respond to your message. I'm around Sunday night but not until after 7ish. Either day works for me 
Also, @BC Football is going 2-10  I did not run into Ryan Jordan today
Also, @BC Football is going 2-10 please give me Mahomes for Julio Jones 
Also, @DJ Chanukah Broncos are not good tonight, man 
Also, @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim, what's your mortgage? 
Also, @Skimmer  went to BC
Also, ^ I’m that person 
Also, 14 minutes in the 4th, down two scores. Definitely not garbage time 
Also, 171.4 which is .4 more than my first weigh in but 2 pounds less than last week so that's an improvement 
Also, 6% so if I don't respond to your chirps, my phone died 
Also, a caller just called into weei to say the league players have a bounty against pats players to try and hurt them. Who the fuck is trying to hurt dobson or amendola?
Also, a fellow I worked with knows the director of admissions well. She says she's weird, and by her description, sounds exactly like Bill. I'm not surprised they accepted him 
Also, a greater emphasis on preventative care and appropriate end of life care would reduce medical costs to begin with 
Also, according to GroupMe, consentual isn't a word. Interpret that as you will 
Also, according to their website, there may be one coming to Brighton? 
Also, according to Wikipedia, Taylor's death is undetermined, with no evidence either confirming nor denying poisoning 
Also, add banning direct to consumer drug advertising to my list of tasks 
Also, all courses must be paired with a wine and the menu must specifically be curated based on my dietary requirements 
Also, all I'm seeing in this photo is a clean pocket. Don't know why everyone is so down on the line 
Also, allegedly according to Browns fans on Reddit, there was a play when the Ravens had 15 defenders on the field and a penalty was not called. Can anyone confirm or deny? 
Also, anyone who hates @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 's dogpark Snapchat should go right ahead and lose my number
Also, apparently collie is still a receiver for a cfl team. I am honestly surprised he still knows his own name at this point 
Also, appreciate the nsfw tag becks (👉🏻^_^)👉🏻
Also, are we just going to let Johnny Dash claim he doesn't breed? We all know he breeds 
Also, as a heads up, this is school vacation week so it’s likely to be mobbed 
Also, at half time, Twitter told me that Diggs had gotten press coverage on like 70% of routes compared to like 25% during the regular season
Also, at least he diagnosed himself with narcissistic personality disorder 
Also, bad news when the military intelligence officer in the GroupMe doesn't know more than the rest of the GroupMe
Also, bad play call 
Also, BB is fully booked on Saturday until 10 pm................
Also, BC athletics back in the news again! They're getting reamed for fucking over smaller sports with their $200 mil complex 
Also, because I like annoying goody: mean, median, and mode are all types of "averages." When you compared the "average" to the median in your post, you looked dumb 
Also, Becker appears in one picture 
Also, been saying this for two weeks, but Elandon Roberts is going to be a star 
Also, before @Chandalay Industries changes the narrative, I didn't tag him in the previous post because he had already responded with his availability 
Also, B-fresh is opening in Davis square. Pretty pumped 
Also, BIG hire by Miami. Tiquan Underwood is their offense quality control coach
Also, Bocker is now a "pediatric medical professional" after working in a GI suite for 2 weeks.
Also, Bocker was going to get a credit card after we talked about it in the summer. Guess he was too busy with fantasy football to take the 30 seconds to apply for one
Also, bocker, rock spot is not as lavish as BKB, or probably as close to you, but if there ever is a time that you want to climb and John isn't around, I'll take you to Rock spot 
Also, Bocker, you got mad at me at the beginning of last season for saying that I thought Smith was a middle of the pack QB. I'm glad you came to your senses
Also, bold move by Marcus starting Alvin Kamara 
Also, bold prediction. Chip Kelly won't be the coach of the Eagles next season 
Also, Brazil's goalie is a fucking flopper
Also, breathe*
Also, bring back Channe Frank
Also, can't wait for this warriors/cavs final. Just what I predicted all along!
Also, Chan I apologize if it felt like I was coming at you. I didn't not mean to transfer or direct my feelings towards you in particular. Just want you to know that I still love you and want you always on my lists
Also, Chan would never insult me. How dare you insinuate that my good friend Chan would ever be disrespectful 
Also, classic Bocker move. I'm defending doctors and bashing goody and jordan and Bocker goes back several days in the groupme to prove me wrong. Be more Bocker, you can't. 
Also, classic fuckhole move to get too drunk to DD home 
Also, classic Marcus. Shelbie movies from Alabama to Chicago to be with him. Then he leaves for the summer before they get married to stay in DC, and then uproots their new family to move back across the country to Dallas 
Also, college football teams play 0 defense 
Also, commissioner @The Fucking Man, can you veto the suggestion for an offline draft 
Also, congrats on the job offer I suppose
Also, cooks was open 
Also, could you additionally imagine actually supporting LeBron? That dude is hot garbage
Also, COVID hospitalizations went up today
Also, Danny “Woodcock” is retiring 
Also, Darius Wade going to Delaware 
Also, darrow really fucked up this last Fuckhole dinner 
Also, Dave Roberts 🐐
Also, decided that I'm all on the Buttchug train 
Also, Delta is cancelled. 
Also, dental students dissected cadavers down to the waist at Tufts, so I think they learn more than just the mouth 
Also, did they have a veteran combine this year or did they abandon that after a season?
Also, didn't fivethirtyeight predict that Rubio would get the nomination? 
Also, didn't he have surgery? 
Also, do not like niners black jerseys 
Also, does your mother remember me or not 
Also, don't like to cheer for injuries, but Doug Martin left the game and my matchup against Jordan got a little more winnable 
Also, don't you want to go to B school just so you can travel the world and bang people named Taylor (siblings of this GroupMe excluded)
Also, doubt this cop ends up getting in trouble after watching the second video that was released. 
Also, drove all the way home from the same concert venue in Portland and did not get pulled over. 
Also, Edmonds is getting torn down today. Let's all pour one out.
Also, Emyr owned him and then dropped him. Also also, I know never to trust a pats wide receiver in fantasy 
Also, Emyr’s defense scored a touchdown. FAKE NEWS 
Also, ESPN is a big stakeholder in the NBA, which as I posted several weeks ago, is likely to have one of its worst seasons in terms of ratings in recent years. That's a big hit 
Also, fake news about the Uber situation. Did not have a problem whatsoever 
Also, first game in super bowl history where the quarterback who threw a pick six one the game 
Also, FOH if you don't think I have been awake for hours 
Also, for the next two years Gronk/Edelman/Lewis have an average COMBINED cap hit of 12.9mil. That's basically robbery. 
Also, for whoever is in Boston, would y'all like to come over for The Big Game
Also, forgot to mention that the $10 is good until the end of the month. Use it. Don't use it. Give it away. Literally don't care 
Also, from previous post, meant first three weeks*
Also, fuck aging, often injured running backs. I will have none of that on my team 
Also, fuck airlines that make you board just to have you sit there for over an hour due to a delay that they already knew about 
Also, fuck Jordan. I'm going to kick your ass into next week 
Also, fucking 2012. Holy shit we are old.
Also, fun fact, the lions blow and don't deserve to exist as a franchise 
Also, fun fact: I've met Secretary LaHood on two occasions, so I was pretty excited about him coming to speak and then never watched his commencement address
Also, FWIW, Hep C can be sexually transmitted but most commonly is transmitted through IV drug use or other sources of blood mixing
Also, FWIW, it was two pumps. That was a bad penalty 
Also, get Burkhead the fuck out of this game
Also, give me Tate > Jeffrey every day of the week and twice on Sunday
Also, good morning @Marcus Bauer 
Also, goody gets his hair cut in Melrose. 
Also, goody invited me to watch the Super Bowl that year in his apartment. I told him maybe because I had already invited you guys to watch in my room. You all ditched me for him and didn't tell me until halftime so I watched half the game alone in my room 
Also, goody is a bitch 
Also, goody, there was an NPR podcast about the question on your tax form that asks if you want to contribute $10 of your tax return to campaign financing. Apparently it was huge during the 80s and 90s. Candidates basically were funded by the taxpayers and each candidate got the same amount of money to use. But now no one uses it because they can raise more money on their own 
Also, goody. The Life of Pablo is bad, and you should feel bad 
Also, Gordon was late to walk through because he was at the party 
Also, grammar nazis 
Also, great move not calling timeouts at the end of the half when you could try to get into field goal range 
Also, GroupMe is so unlit today that we are forced to acknowledge the significance of July 2nd 
Also, had my senior prom there
Also, has @Chandler Parsons been here the last few days? Or has he just been playing Pokemon 24/7 and can't afford to minimize the game 
Also, has time to run four miles but not to listen to a podcast 
Also, he IS with the Sox still. Don't kill him off yet
Also, he just lost in court. How can he threaten judges, who work in courts, with a trip to court?
Also, heard "Crowell is going to lose snaps to duke Johnson" multiple places 
Also, here is Mr. F's twitter: https://twitter.com/mikeflaim1
Also, hi everybody 
Also, hi Jack 
Also, hope you had a great day today saving lives. You're my hero. 
Also, hope your microbio final went well today,
Also, how about @Skimmer  coming in to like your post "Skimmer" but nothing else
Also, how about Alshon Jeffrey just taking a ball to the doe 
Also, how about kovin not responding to my message in the GroupMe earlier, then trying to trade for a QB, and then just not arguing his side in the GroupMe 
Also, how about Marcus just ignoring my happy birthday text. Don't try and tell me that he didn't get it because he's in Sweden. 
Also, how come @#JustFacts✅ can post his Twitter feed but @Chancy Reagan can't?🤔
Also, how do I make Bocker meet himself? Do I just let him sit in a room alone? 
Also, how many times has mccown left the game with an injury 
Also, how was acquiring Melo going to help our lack of having a capable big man?
Also, I agree with Jordan's opinion on Christine
Also, I am going to miss Joe Judge for his ST coaching but definitely not his WR coaching 
Also, I am not sure there is much difference practically in having to take Friday off versus having to take Monday off 
Also, I am unsure how that escalated, but I think that was a little of an over exaggerated response to beckers comment. He was just doing his due diligence and talking shit to me. 
Also, I asked about Mrs Bocker and not Kyle Bocker 
Also, I bought an instapot during the first prime deal and it's the best kitchen purchase I've ever made. Would highly recommend anyone who likes to cook buy the one on sale today 
Also, I can easily see Morcus showing up 40 minutes before a flight but I still cannot get over the fact that Joe did the same thing. 
Also, I carried my dog 30 feet through a flooded river to drop my dog off at daycare, and Bocker can't walk from a parking lot because it's drizzling out 
Also, I did spent a lot Charles, but I also only spent $1 on Blount, who has 12 touchdowns. And we all know how overvalued touchdowns are. 
Also, I don't remember how Kovin became the troop hater but I am here for it 
Also, I don't think the pizza is actually crawling. I think he's trying but failing miserably 
Also, I feel like I missed some enthralling conversation 
Also, I fully expect Jimmy G to top that list when Tom retires
Also, i hate the selection of games that I can watch. Great, pats are on at one, perfect. Wait, fox isn't showing a game in my area so I can't flip over to that during commercials? That sucks. Oh, and the cowboys are the only team I get at 4:30. Well that blows 
Also, I have 2+ years of experience in streaming. I believe that should count 
Also, I have called ENT for hemotympanum and they don't care 
Also, I heard bocker only drinks water now 
Also, I instantly hate him for saying that the doctors are wrong because "it's not god's plan" for him to get that far just to tease him 
Also, I know I said “in no particular order” but that’s definitely in the exact particular order 
Also, I like morning football 
Also, I nominate Chris Truggs. 
Also, I obviously don't know how else to run the political system, the way campaign financing and ballots work and shit, but I think the two party system is bullshit. I would rather vote on someone's platform and moral compass versus what party they claim to be from
Also, I said 57, not 51. 
Also, I stood through it
Also, I think I'm exempt from the Posa this year 
Also, I think my presence in Southie has devalued the area enough for all the Fuckholes to afford units here 
Also, I think someone told Trump that if he brings back coal, he'll revive X many jobs, and that's a better headline than "Trump keeps X^2 jobs by investing in green energy." More impactful to create than to maintain 
Also, I think the argument "if you don't like the t, find another way to get to work" only strengthens Becker and my argument because you're admitting that the t sucks enough to force people to accept less intrusive inconveniences in order to get to and from work 
Also, I use "teach" very liberally. I kind of just sit there 
Also, I want to point out the fat shaming coming from some members of the groupme. Shoutout to Bocker, Goody, and Nick D for being the most woke members of the Fuckholes 
Also, I was actively infected last time you sat with me during a BC football game
Also, I was referring to John's occupational status 
Also, I was thinking about the similarities of his conspiracy theories with the anti-vaxxer movement and realized something really prolific. Alex Jones spews conspiracy theories. We have often suspected Joe of being Alex Jones. Andrew Wakefield is responsible for the lies about the MMR vaccine and autism. Joe is from Wakefield. Joe is also Andrew Wakefield.
Also, I was willing to give Tony Romo a spot for $0 because honestly my whole team is worthless so who cares if I burn a roster spot 
Also, I would have preferred that they lose in game 7 of the World Series. 
Also, I'd like to pay respect to Ellie Wisel after he passed away today. Great man, it's a shame we lost him 
Also, if 10% of 350 mil people get infected, that's ~30 mil people with mild manifestations who are out of work and quarantined for X # of days, plus all their close contacts who have to quarantine. That can't be good for the economy either
Also, if any of you just started to feel an overwhelming feeling of hatred wash over you, it's because I just landed in Boston. I've been known to have that effect when near 
Also, if anyone was accusing Bock of not posting that he was quitting in the GroupMe, they would be wrong. Not that anyone specifically is accusing him of that, but I distinctly remember him saying that he was no longer participating 
Also, if I could afford it since I didn't even pay for my ticket in New York...
Also, if Jac's falls through or people change their minds and are serious (and not just goody being sarcastic), Olivia is more than happy to have people over for the game. 
Also, if someone doesn’t pay, eventually the bill goes to collection 
Also, if someone needs a celeb shot, I'll be happy to hit a ball far into the woods for you 
Also, if Trump is convicted in the Senate, a simple Senate majority can vote to bar him from ever holding public office ever again in the US
Also, if you name your child Chaim, go jump off the Tobin
Also, if you recover an onsides kick as a receiving team, you get the ball at your opponents 45ish. Teams realistically need 10 or so yards before they can kick a field goal. If you suck at onsides kicks, you're almost gifting the other team at least 3 points
Also, if you're doing the sex and a girl you just met asks you to cum insider her, you best be questioning whether she is actually on birth control or whether she's some freak who wants to be impregnated by a big, strong, air force officer like yourself 
Also, IIRC about that Russian surgeon story, the rest of the crew outright refused to help. He did the whole thing upside down using mirrors 
Also, I'll be in class, so I can't make it 
Also, I'm going to skull fuck the shit out of your team and mop the floor with your blood. 
Also, I'm very happy none of you assholes called me on my 6 hour drive. I didn't want to talk to any of you anyway
Also, in case anyone was questioning how smart BB is; he had his team running hill sprints the weeks leading up to the SB to make sure they were well conditioned for a 60 minute game. 
Also, in case anyone's significant other is trying to get them to see Hail Caesar, please talk them out of it. Worst movie I have seen in the last 5 years 
Also, in response to Goody, NCAA hockey and baseball both allow players to get drafted and still finish their college eligibility. I think the NFL and NBA are just paranoid that their prospects will destroy their bodies after they expend draft picks on them 
Also, in typical Browns fashion, the scouting department wanted to draft Teddy Bridgewater with the Manziel pick but the owners overruled 
Also, initial reaction when I see that Bock has tagged me in a post about 'rona
Also, initial reports are that this was an AR-15-like rifle. I'm not a gun guy, but I see no value in allowing civilians to purchase that kind of gun 
Also, is there any purpose to a senate trial after Biden takes office 
Also, is there any remote possibility that If they find concrete evidence of tampering or votes, the election result is overturned, or are we too far past the point of that possibly happening 
Also, it wasn't collusion because Joe just picked him up yesterday and then dropped him, I assume to make him go to waivers, also because I am still typing this message despite already reading Joe's
Also, it's celiac disease awareness month, so give us recognition for our struggles 
Also, it's defuse, not diffuse 
Also, it's not his fault that he misinterpreted the tweet. Wiz should have been more clear that "kk" could stand for something other than Kim's initials 
Also, it's very common for palliative care/hospice to keep end-of-life patients alive and comfortable longer than experimental treatments (which are exponentially more expensive) which have severe side effects and may not improve prognosis 
Also, I've said it before, but I love having someone more staunchly liberal than I am in the GroupMe 
Also, JBoss apparently retracting his application to the Cabal 
Also, JFF is apparently living with Gordon 
Also, Jim Christian got paid $1.5m for a 2-16 conference record. 
Also, joe has decided that I'm picking the restaurant because he doesn't care enough about me to do the research that Goody did to find a gluten free restaurant for me 
Also, Joe Judge having to point where Brown is supposed to go is funny 
Also, joe maddon just fucked his team 
Also, joe, was going to suggest that you charge goody membership dues, seeing as he still is listed on a team. Glad that we were both on the same page. 
Also, Joff you're an idiot. They don't sell strawberries in pints
Also, John likes a girl who seems very nice and is interested in his interests. What a fucking loser 
Also, John, my pre-existing condition should not have an impact on my ranking. This is what Obama has worked so hard to stop! I demand a recount. 
Also, Jordan got trade raped. That’s an unfair trade. Don’t accept it, Commish 
Also, Jordan if you knew ANYTHING you'd know that Dion Lewis is coming off of the PUP, not IR. SAD.
Also, Jordy targeting the Pats
Also, just had some really good gluten free rolls so I'll pass
Also, just reading about Embiid. The dude broke a small bone in his foot and missed all last season and will probably miss this whole season. Suck it up and play
Also, just saw the hit Tom Savage took today. What the fuck. How does he get let back in the game 
Also, just want@The Big Dick Bandit  to acknowledge my pre-season appreciation of Bentley
Also, lol @ James trying to match into neurosurg
Also, lots of typos
Also, love that goody is a true pats fan. Goes to the bills game, doesn't even bother to watch the pats game live 
Also, love the energy from the Philly fans to boo Dak 
Also, Matthew Slater is good at football things.  
Also, may sound homosexual, but all this time at bc this weekend has given me the feels. I miss you guys. 
Also, Mayo calling the plays tonight
Also, met KD today 
Also, Moooooooookie 
Also, Morcus and I love mayo
Also, my attendance is dependent on my surgery schedule, which I won't have for another month or so 
Also, my co-residents planned dinner at Morimoto last night....not blown away for what I paid 
Also, my walk to school was uneventful. Too bad that you have to take the T 
Also, Nagy out hear lambasting the Bears for their shitty performance. Pot, meet kettle. 
Also, need Trump to get elected now. No way Brady serves this suspension with Trump in office. 
Also, N'Keal Harry with two great back shoulder catches 
Also, no doctor should be stunned if a patient passes a MOCA. That's literally what they signed up to do.
Also, no one gunna call out John for calling Gracie's ice cream "Christina's?"
Also, no thank you. Avocado makes my mouth itchy. I ain't about that life 
Also, not everyone skipped over them. Goody is the only one who made a list
Also, not going to use up any equity I have to leave my wife with two dogs and a baby to go to Wisconsin. And for that reason, I’m out 
Also, not mentioned previously, but Goody is accusing people of not caring about the league when he straight up quit when he lost to Jordan and Emyr\
Also, not sure why I tagged Goody instead of Marcus
Also, Nunes recused himself. That's good 
Also, oh look. @Ex-Ayatollah, Ex-McKinsey is out of the country again 
Also, Olivia and Kristen graduated the same year, so they were both at bc when Becker and I weren't. Becker did live a lot closer to bc though
Also, Olivia doesn't have pre check which is a real beta move 
Also, only going if Marcus and Becker wrestle before the fight 
Also, only one HQ game today. That’s bullshit 
Also, our patients get endoscopes and colonoscopies all the time. There are costs with doing the procedures. Anesthesia, the gastroenterologist, the nurses, the drug cost, preop and postop care, cost of preparing and sterilizing equipment. An insurance company may only pay for 65% of the cost of the procedure. 
Also, overcook*
Also, Patriots win over/under at 8.5. @Legitimate Business Man  might as well throw that whole stim check on the over
Also, pats fired strength and conditioning coach 
Also, people from Boston tend to be assholes in general, so I'm sure hay doesn't help. 
Also, Philly chested. The 4th and goal play only had six players lined up at the LoS
Also, pretty sure we punted more than nine times. We went 51 minutes of game clock without a first down 
Also, Ravens are hypocrites. This is them using the formation they lobbied to ban during yesterday's game 
Also, read the room Boutte. No one likes you. Drake Maye might actually be Jesus and thus only Ass Ketchum and Beanboy hates him 
Also, reese's has a new big cup with pretzels in it, and they are gluten free 
Also, release the emails Joe. 
Also, remember when tadala' whole 8 man was slipping us anonymous notes sophomore year 
Also, RIP Ravens 
Also, rumor has it we are in early talks with some national resident union leaders 👀👀
Also, San Diego State hired an AD that wasn't Brad Bates. Joe Bourque lies to us again 
Also, Sarah Duffy was my lab partner in chem freshman year. 
Also, Schefter is friends with mortensen, who couldn't report his way out of a paper bag 
Also, September weekend works better for me but I don't have the money to spend to really go anywhere. I just spent a ton of money this weekend at s friends wedding. I would probably join online 
Also, side note, I just tried adding Jamie to three different non-Fuckhole groupmes and he can't be added to any of them. He definitely needs to fix something on his end
Also, since I already hate myself enough, I will just leave this here so we all know how we could have converted on the 2 pt attempt 
Also, since the beginning of july, there have been 8 delays considered at least "'moderate" during commuting hours. So that doesn't include middle of the day, early afternoon, nights or weekends. Delays are a fairly common occurrence 
Also, skimmer 
Also, skip your run and hike rainier. 
Also, so that everyone is equally as outraged as I am: the US Attorney based out of Manhattan, who is investigating several cases against Trump and Guiliani has been fired by Trump. Barr announced yesterday that the attorney stepped down, but then the attorney clapped back on Twitter and claimed that he did no such thing and that he planned to stay in office until Congress approved a replacement. Well now Trump has just fired him, which means Trump has fired a DOJ employee who was actively investigating crimes that the president may have committed.
Also, someone should probably fix the groupme avatar now....
Also, sorry for anyone who hasn't gotten a thank you card yet. I may get to them eventually 
Also, spicy take: Damian Lillard's shot was amazing but does not mean anything about his ball size. If he misses it, they go to OT. It was a win-no lose situation.
Also, steelers d baby 
Also, Stowe does not get the pats game 
Also, super lame that kovin asked a question then just up and left
Also, superhero movies 🐩
Also, switching gears, I now love Joe Kelly 
Also, talk about being too chicken to do it on your own account. Sheesh 
Also, talk about letting someone do it on your account. Sheesh 
Also, talking about the opposing team's head "coach" doesn't count as Pats talk
Also, tell her that Kovin2 being a bridesman is cute
Also, that purell bottle was empty and still has not been removed from my bag. It did help me fight germs back in the day
Also, that's "well respected TD Garden manager Mr. Savarino" 
Also, that's a quality baseball fight. Baseball needs more of those. #MakeBaseballFunAgain
Also, the AF vet/terrorist who was shot obviously can't be arrested, but her parents should be for spelling her name "Ashli"
Also, the answer is yes 
Also, the more I look at Jon Jones's hit on Allen, the more I think it was a clean hit. Allen lowered his head and initiated contact. Jones turned his body and did not lead with his helmet. Helmet to helmet contact is not illegal when a player is a runner.
Also, the more oil pipelines, the better. We aren't getting fully electric cars anytime soon, so we might as well do everything we can to lower gas prices 
Also, the Nugget is bad at kicking
Also, the salsa is not a slow dance 
Also, the size of his nose rivals only Goody's
Also, there is a bus that goes essentially from my apartment right to downtown, so if you're fine with getting bus aids, you have that as an option 
Also, there was no pressure up front with the exception of a 39 year old edge defender. Vaitai was clearly their weak link. Scheme something to put more pressure on him 
Also, there were 105 aircraft carriers in use throughout WWII. You can't tell me that building those is harder than 600 million doses (just for the US) of a sterile, injectable cocktail of magic that isn't going to kill you and is going to save you from a deadly virus
Also, these grad student vacations are getting out of hand
Also, they asked us to start moonlighting in the positions that PAs and NPs work in the ED because they are short staffed but are offering to pay us half of what a PA/NP would make per hour because "we don't want to pay you more than your other moonlighting experiences to draw staffing away from those positions"
Also, this is pretty awesome 
Also, this split is crazy
Also, this whole draft is completely covered. How is this still considered outside 
Also, those were the only playoff home run gifs i could find because fuck Bing 
Also, thought we were meeting in charlotte, nc. No? 
Also, TIL that BC has not attempted a field goal all year
Also, TIL that The Beatles were only together for 8 years. 
Also, TIL that Woody is in Kingdom Heats
Also, to be fair, when the reporters from ESPN misreported the OBJ story, Adam Schefter tweeted that he didn't think it was going to be overturned 
Also, to Goody's point: if you ever want to see if a stranger is a terrible person, watch them wait for a drink at a coffee shop. If they stand directly in front of the pick up counter, they're likely to be a selfish puppy-murdering asshole 
Also, to john's chlamydia comment. I was trying to find the gif of fat bastard saying maybe from Austin powers but couldn't find it. So you can all imagine it
Also, to the previous question, according to Wikipedia, Maine is also named after the French province of Maine 
Also, to the quote Goody posted from the WHO speech, about following asymptomatic cases and their contacts: are they not transmitting because they have been diagnosed and are isolating or are they not transmitting because they aren't shedding the virus?
Also, to watch Tyrod Taylor to make sure he doesn't scramble out of the pocket 
Also, Tony Kornheiser and Mike Wilbon say he's a team cancer, coach killer, and uncoachable, so I will take that opinion and use it as my own 
Also, track sprinters push off of blocks. I don't believe they use blocks at the combine
Also, Trump's ad during the football game last night was deemed so racist that Facebook removed it 
Also, Tyler lockett 
Also, typo 
Also, walked about a mile along the Charles last night and only encountered one magikarp. You guys will be out there for a while to get 400
Also, want to correct my their* from earlier 
Also, way different than Canadian bacon
Also, we know that by shitting on John's choice of fashion, we are guaranteeing that he will go out and buy those shoes, right? 
Also, west Virginia is more white than NHS
Also, whenever I think of libertarianism, I think of the planet money podcasts where they go to conventions in the middle of the woods where everyone pays with shavings of gold and I just think you must be mentally handicapped to do that 
Also, where we brunchin'
Also, whether or not it's intentional, Shelbie is clearly shaming Marcus with her food puns 
Also, whichever team sends us the highest bribe will win 
Also, while I would certainly appreciate you helping unload it in melrose, I don't expect anyone to come all the way out there to do that and will be happy to look for additional help on the other end if you could only help in aouthie 
Also, who do the Pats play next week after their bye this week? I didn't see the result of the Titans game 
Also, who is Jeff 
Also, who schedules an 8 am meeting where there is prep work involved day-of?
Also, whoever bought that is no longer allowed to possess testicles 
Also, whoever doesn't show up (or gets up to get pizza) is getting Austin collie #sophomoreyear
Also, why does this city have so many red lights 
Also, why would I send you stale gluten free bread for a running back?
Also, WMed's waitlist is very fluid. Also also, it saves me from having to spend another minute in Kalamazoo 
Also, Woody harrelson in a star wars movie sounds awful 
Also, would like to point out that I am clawing my way back into my matchup with Darrow. No chance I win, but trying to put up a respectable performance in my last regular season game
Also, would rather gouge my eye out with a flathead screwdriver than drive anywhere in NJ
Also, WOW airlines flight to Iceland from Boston, $99 (one way)
Also, wow Kaizer (spelling?) is bad 
Also, Yolanda's sister is a bridesmaid. I will show you guys the pictures after tomorrow 
Also, you accidentally a word 
Also, you guys are morons for choosing the Team of The Fuckholes to be the team that will lose to Brock Lobster
"Also, your list went from 
Position - Name 
to
Name - Position. 
That bothers me. Fix it. "
Also, your*
Also, you're all bad at organizing meals except for Chan, who was the only one who took the initiative to pick a place
Also, zero chance you get him to come out and do anything nowadays 
Also,@DJ Chanukah  would like to state that I am 3-3 and have four starting caliber running backs on my team
Also,@Skimmer  that's a fair interpretation
Also. You were ALWAYS my friend 
"Also: 
https://twitter.com/deangelorb/status/788840691313086466"
Also: "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts informed us on February 11 that vaccine will no longer be distributed to any Massachusetts hospitals, except as needed for the second dose vaccination. The only sites that will receive additional vaccine are clinics operated by cities and towns, local pharmacies and the state." Lol.
Also: "Three days before the pro-President Donald Trump riot at the Capitol, the Pentagon asked the U.S Capitol Police if it needed National Guard manpower. And as the mob descended on the building Wednesday, Justice Department leaders reached out to offer up FBI agents. The police turned them down both times, according to a defense official and two people familiar with the matter." 
Also: niners are legit reborn. Jimmy G is the second coming of Jesus (the first coming being Tom Brady)

Amazon also said that the average salary for jobs created will be six figures. You aren't helping the disadvantaged populations who have fewer opportunities for jobs as it is with those numbers. You are helping the people who already have the means and resources to be successful without Amazon

An NFL required press conference should focus on football. If the athlete wants to make himself available for time outside of that, be my guest. Brady and the patriots made it clear he wasn't going to answer questions about trump. His last interview, he got asked one and decline to answer. The reporters were warned that there was time for one more question and another reported asked him a second question about trump, which of course he declined to comment on. Just a waste of everyone's time

And fix the wifi 
And for all our girls to send Darrow nudes 
And for conception help, you'd see a gyn specialist, which may require a referral, higher copay, higher out of pocket cost, etc. 
And four players got hurt today 
And free WiFi and TV's that sometimes work 
And Friday night fsu game. But they play 10 straight weeks before they get a bye week. That sucks. 
And from the games I have seen, Wilson doesn't look like he is running as much. He's good when he moves his feet, he's not a true pocket passer and I feel like that's become a big part of their offense 
And from the NYT, no less 
And FS1 worked hard to get great ESPN personalities like Colin Cowherd and Michelle Beadle 
And fuck becker 
And fuck bocker. 
And fuck Darrow too 
And fuck if I'm using AirPods with a Google pixel
And fuck you Ryan 
And fuck you. 
And funding organizations linked to the hijacking of several planes and the murder of thousands of people
AND giant vegetables. This place has it all 
And Gilmore
And golf 
And golson to Florida state 
And goody doesn't have to lose my number 
And Goody is googling them. By the transitive property, Bocker is googling them.
And goody just lost his 8th grandfather last year. The wound is still fresh 
And goody was not at that one. Pretty self explanatory 
And goody wouls know. He is often full-throated. 
And goody, he's unreal. I was just doing this thing where I give you shit for no reason at all
And goody, you can call your insurance company before a procedure or test or medication and have them tell you what the out of pocket cost would be. Just no one wants to wait on the phone to deal with an insurance rep 
And Goody's cousin, Marquise Goodwin opts out 
And Gurley fumbles. Everything coming up Joff
And had to get benched in the super bowl 
And happy birthday Jamie!
And have contingency plans in place to scale back if needed. If you take it at the right speed, you should be able to do it safely. 
And he almost got John Farrell fired last year after his "instagramming while taking a shit during the middle of the game" stunt 
And he already have up $15 to chan for Christine Michael 
And he can't get into a top grad school and do fantasy football 
And he could have traded Bradford to the Browns for a first rounder 
And he didn’t even invite me
And he gets a catch 
And he gets to cover the emergency department! 
And he had the opportunity to say one small thing about it and move on, but he chose to discuss it for a good five minutes 
And he had to go sleep in the hallway/bathroom in case he threw up 
And he has aides
And he has luscious hair 
And he helped reverse the curse 
And he is going to be a doctor 
And he leaves super bowls early 
And he left with a hip injury for part of it 
And he made fun of my co-residents multiple times, which I enjoyed 
And he outplayed both the wr1 and wr2 that week soooo
And he says Joe is white 
And he spreads rona through not following appropriate social distancing efforts
And he thinks Bocker and I are whipped. 
And he took that hit for nothing 
and he will never be lovable due to his complete indifference towards losing weight, getting in shape, not being a douchebag
And he won't get jerked off because the bills lost 
And he’s a snake
And he’s subject to waivers! Browns get their quarterback! 
And he’s the definition of a neck beard
And here I thought he only wanted to avoid getting lunch with me, not climbing with me too 
And here I was thinking that we just established him as a non skimmer
And he's a hero 
And he's already posted the same tweet twice. He's trying to be funny
And he's been so good that they went through most of the year without having their lack of corner depth be exploited 
And he's in an awful offense on a bad team
And he's old
And he's supposed to help people with mental illness
And he's ugly
And his brother too :( 
And his brother. And he was just married like 10 days ago 
And his burgers are overpriced. Fuck that guy 
And his burgers suck
And horrific punt coverage 
And how can the packers have the best rb AND best wr. That's just unfair 
And how could I forget that greatest day in nfl history 
And how much would you have won if Bocker wasn’t there
And I agree with Chanimal that we should do something Friday 
And I agree with McCown. He has essentially been a coach for the last 5 years
And I also agree that the people who stormed Costo and grocery stores are making the problem worse
And I also agree with Bocker
And I am also not saying to fire him, I'm simply arguing that he is a mediocre coach at best.
And I am both
And I am qualified to decide what is worth it for him 
And I apologize for disrupting the flow of the GroupMe. Hopefully we can return to our regularly scheduled programming 
And I brought buffalo chicken dip and honey Sriracha wings 🔥🔥🔥
And I can see that I didn't miss anything important. Good, I was so worried. 
And I connected it to my facebook
And I didn't even text the radiologist 
And I didn't say I wouldn't enjoy the taste of the food 
And I do like rap music. Your narrative is incorrect 
And I don't like that there are other buttons next to the text box when I am trying to send a text 
And I don't trust you to not fuck this up again 
And I got my churros which were not perfect but satisfied my craving
And I guess 1/2 sorry @Jordan Kelleher 
And I guess we fundamentally disagree on this, but saying that the coaches and players with preexisting conditions don't matter and that you should work around them is pretty shitty to say. All I can say is that I am glad you don't make decisions that impact my health.
And I have returned this year as a hopefully more disciplined player 
And I heard that Danny Ainge likes Lonzo too, so unclear if he'd be disappointed in having to take him 
And I kept obj and bell. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise 
And I know goody disagrees with me, but I'm a firm believe that Jimmy G is the next lord and savior of foxboro, but I don't feel like we're going to have many more chances to play for a super bowl going forward 
And I like to ignore that my team was last place in the standings and focus on how my team was probably only seventh in everyone's hearts 
And I love @#Just📠✅ for his hated of cfb
And I meant "as of 2014" referring to the games since the overtime rule change 
And I need a miracle to win. Which makes miracle whip relevant. Sort of?
And I probably won't be available tomorrow 
And I realize this is probably how most people felt when Brady gets the same ESPN attention 
And I realized how unrealistic it would be for me to be happy moving so far away from family and friends. And Olivia's parents might have me killed 
And I respect you for that 
And I said I was busy. Still didn’t get an invite
And I think Oregon too
And I think there is a difference between that posted on a Wordpress site and an article in the Washington post...
And I think we all remember that she was head cheerleader 
And I thought that it was the buffalo bills, not the buffalo hillarys #badtwitterjokes
And I vehemently support the troops 
And I want to know why Drake is on one of his songs now 
And I was only saying they suck because you have connections. And you're dead to me. 
"And I was only there for 5-10
Minutes "
And I was the fucking assistant principal's son! Where the fuck is my special treatment!
And I won 
And I won't be in Boston so you don't have to worry about that either 
And I won't it in a raffle that I didn't enter at a conference back in high school 
And I wore a mask most of the time to protect my brother so he didn't bring it home to his 36 week pregnant wife 
And if Bourne and Pop don't get massacred 
And if he didn’t actually have a legal DNR, you’d get sued 
And if his rebar isn't going well and he isn't worth that much, I don't keep him and I still have plenty of money in my free agent budget 
And if I did, I wouldn’t tag you in it 
And if I don't know, do I lose Thompson points?
And if so, yes probably by him 
And if you don't believe, just read the reaction on social media after his comments last night 
And if you're Auburn, you just plain lose 
And I'm asking for suggestions so I don't eat more of fruit and protein bars than I already do, numnuts
And I'm level 13
And I'm only helping care for people dying of chronic illness. I can't imagine how difficult doing finances for a discount department store must be 
And I'm pretty sure I've been added to the 🐩 list at least 20 times 
And I'm pretty sure you can't change the draft time on draft day 
And in a way, her whole life is a performance
And in game management has not improved
And Indian chicks. 
And is this Chris Chan or Chan who isn't attending? 
And it also limits the services that are covered. 
And it avoids putting drug abusers in jail. Which keeps them working and contributing to the community while still ensuring that they follow-up on their court appointments 
And it costs Jordan Richards his leg 
And it gave you AIDS
And it is cross platform too. So I am playing with people on Xbox as well
And it just so happens joe is employed in the former category
And it was also due to a mask shortage for people on the front lines 
And it was online registration, which takes away the fun of actually registering 
And it was the inspiration for one of my favorite mashups 
And it won't stop 
And it’s at 3 pm and 9 pm almost every day 
And it's not a good way 
And Jboss didn't sit the year before. Clearly the punishment was really having an impact on the league...
And Jboss is about 17 minutes from finishing, according to his live tracker
And Jefferson tried to murder a fan 
And Jeremy just watched you do it 
And joe and Jamie once they come to their senses and move here 
and joe got him
and joe. BWW by the square one mall?
And Joe's second favorite BC sports team is losing to perennial powerhouse Belmont 
And Joff
And John can chip in a few bucks after he gets rich off of his healthcare mutual fund thing 
And John invited Kloee to spy on me 
And John just said that he might enroll in it 
And John, if they win their next five games, 100% chance at an undefeated regular season. If they lose one of them, 0% chance at an undefeated regular season 
And Jordan
And Jordan and Morcus 
And Joseph is trying to replicate it by saying it would take him 5 tries 
And just like that, Bocker and his optimism has doomed BC football to lose out 
And just realized that I can use my slingbox to get to nesn if this stream stops working again 
And just to avoid spoilers, no one in this groupme should watch until I do 
And kick
And Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. 4.9 stars on Google
And lack of understanding of how virus was spread, so lots of healthcare professionals were infected while treating patients
And Lamar Miller tore his ACL 
And Larry Fitz 
And last years scores were higher than this years 
And Lebanon 
And lebron is unhappy 
And LeBron missed the playoffs because he sucks as a teammate and no one wants to play with him 
And legal
And like Christian Fauria's son broke his leg "tripping over his puppy" on his stairs 
And like I said, true to my punishment, I took the WHOLE exam, which is more than you could say 
And like trading your 3rd round pick for another team's 1st round pick 
And liked the post I tagged you in 
And live near my aunt? I would kill myself 
And lobster wok
And lol you don't want to drive into the city at 7 pm. The roads around MGH are a mess 
And lots of bear mace
And Mahomes is so far below Brady 
ANd Majora's Mask
And make it independent of colleges. 
And Manafort sentenced to an additional 3.5 years today. Then immediately indicted on state charges. Thoughts @Jordan Kelleher ?
And maybe I won't suck next year 
And maybe someday, Peyton and Brady can both pass Kirk cousins on the goat scale 
And maybe without your DC too
And me? 
and mlb too 
And mucho mexicanos 
And murdered the bots (most of them) 
And my background is just six years in marathon medicine. 
And my best man/med school friend 
And my butler 
And my tight end do anything 
And my vast experience as an armchair gm gives me the authority to say that 
And Nate Frees predated Daz
And next to Jordan 
And Nick but only when he posts and it's funny with is 95% of his posts 
And no Darrow, that was Students for Sexual Health
And no, Jordan, I didn’t admit anything. I just said that Vontez didn’t do it 
And no, Jordan, we don't study Latin anymore. One of my professors has already complained to us about that 
And no, Scotty Doesn't Know wasn't even nominated 
And non-almost dead people 
And not be a bitch after you drop it 
And not blowing in the way that Goody blows
And not pay taxes 
And not the kind that's good to look at
And now add weird females to the list. Do not want. 
And now it's even better 
And now it's in the groupme, so it must be true 
And now KC is giving him another chance for the 2 point conversion. 
And now must hand over all of that $120 mil 
And now no one is going to actually look for who did it, if not her
And now that tight end went and concussed himself. What an idiot 
And now will Fuller is dead 
And now you know the story about how I should be rich but still am a poor 
And now you're enabling goody by not denouncing him. 
And objectively attractive, no homo
And of course saving Hyrule, illuminating the Depths, and visiting all the Sky Islands 
And Olivia
And one final point, I have also not seen any data to suggest that it ISN'T beneficial, again because I haven't looked. 
And one year I wasn't in a tent 
And others 
And our defense needs to stop getting penalties 
And our soccer team didn't get to use a locker room. We literally changed every day on the side of the field on the Lynn fells parkway. Parents were constantly complaining about the naked dudes pissing changing on the side of the road 
And pac man jones should be thrown out for pushing the ref 
And Patscap has the same number
And pays themselves!
And pegging
And people are too stupid to realize that
And people feel like they don't want to pay taxes for someone else's health care 
And people say having a baby is hard 
And Philly's D doing a complete 180 from last year/the beginning of this year has been cool to see. And it's fun when Morcus is dumb 
And Pop was open
And Prima brought this man to the Eras tour...
And probably will keep Landry 
And questions about his desire to play through
And randy moss in!
And remember that I agreed to pay $50
And repeatedly raped women while high fiving friends that were also raping women 
And replaced it with your whole foot?
And Ricky? 
And right across the bridge from where I work. Ipso facto you probably don't want to work there 
And right around the corner from me 
And rivers 
And sacks 
And said that *we need to play better" but didn't comment on how awful the coaching was 🤔
And sailing isn't ACC either 
And Sammy Watkins has a broken foot 
And Sandoval gets the first RBI of the season for the Sox. Just like everyone predicted 
And Schefter is reporting that a 1 game suspension is likely for OBJ. I think we have to keep goody away from all sharp objects for the next few weeks 
And Schumer said he's firing the sergeant in arms if he doesn't resign too 
And Secret Life of Animals 
And shafting 
And smoking weed 
And so I guess we're not going to be able to pay for chandler jones
And some people in this GroupMe trust this guy to read, interpret, and effectively implement evidence based research 
And someone is still going to pay him 250mil after this year 
And someone punches Allen Fung in the face 
And son has been broadcasting the ALCS games for the national network since 2007. They offered him a national spot in 2011 when his contact with NESN was up and he opted to sign back with NESN to stay here. Guy grew up in Melrose, this was his dream job and the team he wanted to cover. Sucks 
And soon to be a ranked Cuse
And sorry for spunky. Autocorrect from doubly
And sounds like it will be a long hike, so plenty of time 
And Southern California is getting shit on currently. Bad news. 
And southern Mass! 
And spelled threw wrong
And stay home!
And Steve young 
And stole Mr. Bourque's gurl
And stored at -80 degrees celcius
And surprisingly it wasn't me!
And syntax help 
And Taylor. Nice 
And thanks Jboss, appreciate the input
And that Ben could sit down with any player and immediately command respect and than Brady couldn't sit down with the pats defensive line for pizza and command respect from them so why should Bart Scott respect him 
And that is every UFC fighter I know 
And that is why He's a DH
And that is why I am only a 2 on the pee scale. Jags gunna Jags 
And that isn't meant to be a Browns vs patriots question. More money vs winning 
And that knocked goody out of the playoffs. And for that, we are forever grateful. 
And that person was not Andrew bocker 
And that will be my last post on the matter. My new argument is that all college should be free.
And that’s why he’s my friend 
And that’s why you have to have an extra slot or three extra slots for teams like BC who go 11-1 but lose to their conference champion
And that's #MyNarrative on why the Chiefs suck ballz
And that's 100% targeting.
And that's almost in Melrose. So at least we have that going for us, which is nice. 
And that's an understatement 
And that's his favorite fucking memory in four years at bc. Getting norovirus from contaminated burritos 
And that's not because of any of his other policies. That's simply because he lied about Tom Brady's support 
And that's with missing three or four games due to injury 
And that's your downfall 
And the 11 minute train was packed 
And the 2024 BC Eagles
And the 9ers have a game today
And the bar for retiring a jersey/number needs to be much higher
And the baseball and softball coaches. And women's hockey and basketball. And sailing 
And the bengals may lose up to 10 players for to close contact to a positive test
And the Broncos just figured out that the right end position still existed last night. Before last night they were only averaging 20 yards to tight ends per game 
And the Carolina Panthers 
And the CBO thinks that insurance premiums will continue to rise for at least 10 years jordan 
And the decision is final? 
And the Dem candidate beat Kobach in Kansas gov race 
And the DNC royally fucked up by not putting someone who was actually likable on the ticket 
And the first place afc schedule. Not fun
And the first time it happened on a published paper. You'll get there someday
And the guy expects to play a full football game in the NFL. Dude has balls, I would have pussied out after being in the er until 2 am Tuesday 
And the Koch brothers announced they'll pour money into candidates to defeat anyone who votes yes 
And the layout and format is very subpar 
And the neighbor you pass the infection to has a better chance of living if they are also vaccinated
And the Ners
And the offensive line that was Swiss cheese 
And the only people who nutted over Gordon were you, Emyr, and Joe.
And the orange line is fine as long as you don't go past back bay 
And the other brand you tried on was saucony 
And the packers have a non existent short passing game. Which the patriots have essentially perfected 
And the play didn't even count 
And the prophecy is fulfilled 
And the second down play 
And the steak continues 
And the world is starved of khakis 
And their roles aren’t working for me 
And theismann was also at the game today 
And then Chiefs get the ball back with like 30 seconds left and the first play they run, Alex smith can't find a receiver so he runs 10 yards to the middle of the field and slides when he could have run out of bounds. So they burn their last time out, then he gets sacked and they all just stand their for the last 10 seconds and let time expire without trying another play 
And then do the same with Brad Bates and hopes he ends up at Michigan and ruins them for stealing Don Brown 
And then everyone went PC and said the Globe was sexist 
And then gronk gets the touchdown obviously 
And then I hit her with a water balloon condom 
And then I see becks type "that was fun" 
And then I'll probably agree with you 
And then it just spread for there 
And then Kovin will read your MRI 
And then lose it.
And then miss the xp 
And then Morcus said that college football parity is perfect 
And then murders his career, dooming him to a backup role until he retires in disgrace?
And then picking them back up six times a game
And then qbs who shouldn't be more than 2nd or 3rd round picks end up with the expectation that they will start and lead their teams to glory
And then refused to fix @joffbot
And then steal your TV 
And then subtly get another hit in just after the whistle
And then telling a GroupMe full of dudes about it
And then that week, they switched to mostly take out only
And then the entire Epic system literally crashed the very next day
And then the next play is a pass to Kittle that gets knocked down at the LOS
And then the Yankees crying about it 
And then we got murdered
And then you can celebrate with KFC 
And then you could squad up with us
And then you met Joe Bourque 
And then?
And there are pictures everywhere of laypeople using ppe incorrectly.... Touching their face or phone with contaminated gloves on. I would find it hard to believe that the general citizen would don/doff an n95 without contaminating their hands
And there was no streaming services back then 
And they all suck
And they are gonna send back a late round pick to Miami too
And they are in like the top 5% of programs in terms of competitiveness. Didn't even try 
And they both have cap space
And they didn't hire their interim coach who got them to the playoffs. Lol
And they get paid goody. Fucking awful 
And they got an extra 4th 
And they had to wait to tear down Edmonds until they finished 2000 comm ave and this new building 
And they sent a cease and desist to Pokevision. Fuck them. 
And they sometimes get to sleep some of the hours they are there
And they still let you serve in the military? 
And they will still lose in the NLDS
And they're all pussies because it's mostly children and old people and people in poor countries without running water 
And they're SAD 
And they're trying to take away American jobs by hosting in Australia next year. 
And this guy is a doctor
And this is exactly why no one expects anything from Chan 
And this is from a so-called center of higher learning. Shame.
And this is Linsanity
And this is the guy who wants to lead our league. smh
And this is the man who is responsible for defending our nation 
And this play was in development for a year 
And this. Lit. 
And Thompson looks like he's concussed too 
And threatening to punish players with less playing time if they reported covid symptoms and refusing to wear a mask
And through House oversight committee?
And TJ Yeldon
And to be fair, that team was in last place when Jamie had it because Chan relied 100% on the broncos and everyone on their team got old or retired 
And to be fairer, commissioner Darrow has been advertising the draft as 9/3 at 7 pm since day one. 
And to find out right after the birth of his son
And to prove that she isn't a brainwashed sheep
And to think Dan Hanzus was so high on them in this week's pregame show 
And to think I was under the impression I couldn't respect the Thompsons any less than I already did. Then they go and do something like this. 
And Todd Bowles is fat now 
And trying to knock Norman out with cheap ass helmet to helmet shots 
And turkey 
And unsurprisingly I think he was injured during the final stretch 
And vaguely Mexican/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean?
And vollmer. And Mason. 
And vouri everything
And vVable as a CEO head coach has to find both an OC and DC 
And walruses don't usually live this long
And was going to run as an independent for president but then dropped out, correct?
And was wrapped up 
And wasted a timeout. Yaaay 
And we all know it's about me 
And we all respect you for that, Joseph.
And we are bad
And we don't know what Emyr, Jamie, and Morcus got 
And we get to hear Ian Foutes 😑
And we have ochocinco
And we have the same name, so it was practically like I was doing it 
And we only beat them by a touchdown...
And we only paid $325k on it too! 
And we sell Rhode Island to Mexico 
And we should invest in PottyView
And we were both right 
And what time 
And whatever program your school used to match you with people who don't watch movies 
And when I said "I think we all agree with," I was referring to the groupme, since everyone who has weighed in said they supported stricter vetting procedures
And when I say could, I mean could. He could also rule right away that the nfl wasn't following the cba when issuing punishment 
And where is my invite 
And while it was busy, there was always a room open. We sometimes had to wait for a room to clear if we wanted to work on a specific challenge, but we often just moved to whichever rooms were open 
And while that game was okay (denounce the anti-Semitic undertones), it was no TotK
And with that, I'm going to bed. Good luck finishing the fight, Becker. 
And without doctors, neither the engineers nor the finance people would have jobs.
And women's right*
And would be funny if he ditched Mike Lombardi at UNC
And would have won the election had China not hired Eric Cartman to steal ballots and hide them in a Hummer dealership
And would you rather Umass/Harvard/Uconn be a home team at Fenway next season and further cement BC's fall to irrelevance in New England?
And yeah Jacksonville missed the boat. He would have sold tickets 
And yes 
And yes Goody. They benched Kelly and he left the team. He was their starter
And yes he's a Mormon 
And yes I know, my team sucks, but still.
And yes, I do know I could have kept him for crazy cheap money. 
And yes, it's fucking crazy 
And yes, we are at 4 pm on Saturday 
And yet everyone still blames Bill like it was 100% his choice
And yet Tufts still won't let us have an outdoor graduation...
And yet you support them financially....
And you actually think I am being serious about that?
And you can get repeatedly nominated if you're a badass 
And you can't convince me that that was "juice" that spilled on the couch cushion. Definitely was purple drank.
And you could have them with or without sauce 
And you get all the perks of being a "donor"
AND YOU GET NONE
And you have a 33.33333% chance of not making your flight. Not great odds 
And you made it our problem
And you'd have one less car to pee on
And Young Sheldon (RIP in peace)
And your $28m figure is misleading because two of the players you listed are still on their rookie contracts, and as you mentioned, Brady's salary shouldn't even be part of the calculation because it's so unfairly 🐐
And your at med school and can't stir the pot as often 
And your comment about Umass's off campus stadium- it's literally a two hour drive away from their campus. Fenway is a 20 minute t ride from BC. Completely different situations 
And your company doesn't pay for someone to clean your shit dick off? 
And your name on the Fuckholes trophy (provided you won a legitimate championship)
And your practice squad-WR-turned-QB had the same number of picks today as Tom Brady 
And your starting line up has as much of a chance to get injured as I have to mismanage my team 
And you're coming back to the "no added sugar" exercise in consciousness 
And you're slowly getting lung cancer from second hand smoke 
And yup

And, like many constitutional matters, is based on interpretation of a document produced in the 1780s that was used to govern the east coast of a new country with the fraction of the population and no such thing as assault rifles

Andre Carter
Andre Johnson is flying on Jim irsay's private jet to Indy. Doubt either of us will get him 
Andre Williams hate has been discussed on multiple occasions in this GroupMe. This should not be a TIL and represents your failure as a human being.
Andre Williams was a 4th rounder, so I would be hard pressed to count that as a bust 
Andrea is a nice woman, please don't corrupt her with your unemployment
Andrew "Chris Chan" Bocker
Andrew Becker. So brave. 
Andrew Bocker, MD, MA, MFA
Andrew Bourque: following in Uncle Becker's footsteps. Named the next BCEMS Members Services Coodinator 
ANDREW JACKSON DID NOT WIN. THIS TOURNAMENT IS BULLSHIT 
Andrew Jackson got shot so close to his heart, that they couldn't operate. He not only continued and won the duel in which he got shot, he went on to be a badass. Nomar hurt his wrist didn't play anymore 
Andrew Jackson is Stephen Jackson's uncle. Darrow, you need to support him 
Andrew Jackson is the only true 🐐 in this tournament. Do you really want to agree with goody on his choice of 🐐??
Andrew Jackson is the reason why Native Americans don't have more land. Therefore, it's his fault we don't have more casinos around the US. I'm sure Becker will agree that this is a travesty 
Andrew Jackson was always my favorite president 
Andrew Jackson was paid to kill people. Specifically, he fucked up the British army. That's as badass as it gets. He (probably) single handedly won us the war of 1812. As that old saying goes, the enemy of the British is the 🐐: Andrew Jackson=🐐
Andrew Jackson? 
Andrew Luck garbage time TDs should not count 
Andrew Luck just died I think
Andrew luck with the worst throw in history 
Andrew Luck 🐩
Andrew Luck? More like Andrew Fuckingucks amirite
Andy Brickley, color commentator for the Bruins, is also from Melrose 
Andy dalton can't win big stage games. He isn't a good quarterback 
Andy galick
Andy Reid and tom coughlin have been coaching for too long to be this bad at clock management 
Andy Reid gets like 14 minutes to decide to challenge or not 
Andy Reid is a pussy. Go for that on 4th 
Andy Reid is probably fine. I haven't seen any reports about the virus infecting walruses 
Andy Reid never loses after a bye. The offseason was an extra long bye. Good for the chiefs for mentally coming back after being raped in the Super Bowl. 
Andy Reid should have gone for it on 4th and half a yard
Andy Reid. Not talented. Looks like a walrus.
Anecdotal, but in March 2016, I bought a brand new set of Vokls with bindings for $500. The same set was selling for about $900 during the season. I’m sure there would have been a bigger discount had I waited a little longer 
Anecdotally, I do tell people to try to drink warm tea or soda. Sometimes the warm helps relax the muscles in the esophagus and the soda may break up any impaction, but only if they aren't vomiting or at risk of choking. So your info was better than Kovin's 
Angela being in charge does not bode well for my status in the clan

Anthony, I noticed you liked Kovin's comment "How I imagine Joff as a glutard." I hope that you are not deviating from team #JustFacts*green checkmark*. It would be very hurtful if you were supporting Kovin over your good friend Joff.
Anthony, I think that’s where we disagree. In my view, by agreeing to take part in a civilized society, it should be incumbent on you to adhere to a certain set of laws that ensure safety of everyone else in the society. If the society determines that something is unsafe for the society as a whole, it should be within the power of the society to infringe on whatever personal liberty you think you have for the common good. Obviously that argument can’t apply to everything because you enter into the gray area of authoritarianism, but I think the data Jordan posted show pretty resoundingly that much of society supports at least some type of increased restriction
Anthony, I thought you'd be smarter to realize that a gif of a wink doesn't count as a legally binding agreement, and thus doesn't hold me to the terms of the deal. If you have a problem, you can take it up with my in-house counsel (council?) @Skimmer 
Anthony, if you didn't notice, none of the things I listed counts as physical activity. I know that a complicated sarcastic response like that one goes over your feeble head, but that's ok 
Anthony, keeper of the L's, explain how I took an L to me.

As @Mr. Large Pectorals was present, he can attest that Devin asked me in person to add him and I felt bad saying no. Once he was here, I enjoyed his company and didn't want him kicked out. Those two things are not mutually exclusive
As a BC fan, I hope it doesn't trickle down to college 
As a big coffee drinker, Dunkin is objectively bad coffee but it's our objectively bad coffee
As a big Keltics fan, I am devastated
As a Boston Fuckhole, I am working
As a certified fatty, I have become one with the fat jokes
As a completely unbiased observer, #TeamBecker clearly won that argument 
As a concerned citizen, I would rather listen to more news about the report if it meant having the most accurate interpretation of what it means. I think a large portion of the country would agree with me. More than those who couldn't care less about the report 
As a consumer of news related to the NBA, you are complicit in the railroading of the Buccs
As a consumer of sous vide meat on many occasions, I am v much looking forward to cooking in sous vide bags 
As a devout Catholic, I am of the believe that you should only jerk off one dick in your life. Or something like that. Either way I'm invoking religious privilege!
As a devout crossfit member, I am sure Joe is happy to hear that his sport (once a crossfitter, always a crossfitter) is saving lives from both diabetes and COVID
As a fan of football, this is a good game 
As a fellow homeowner, I'm glad @quintenpostsuperfan222 is a rich and supports the cause 
As a founding member of donahue's disciples, I have been unable to watch BC basketball due to the horrendous play during this era
As a Fuckhole, I obviously claim to be a baseball expert and I hate that call 
As a Fuckhole, I support the narrative that Bock is a welfare queen. As a theoretical member of a GroupMe that celebrates property owners, I am 100% behind my good friend Bock 
As a future parent, I'm working 24 hours a day
As a general rule, I hate watching amateurs play sports and this is even worse because it's middle schoolers 
As a general rule, the GroupMe should stop interacting with high schoolers 
As a guy rooting for the 'cos, I like the no challenge

As a lifelong Ners diehard fan, I am in the same boat as Jordan. 
As a Maine resident for 14 weeks of my life, I am confident that Maine will win 
As a Matt Ryan fantasy owner, yes. 
As a medical student who was actively prevented from directly caring for COVID patients, I definitely think that all of my med school debt should be forgiven
As a new parent, I can't always make the time to eat healthy. I understand what @Champion ‘11 & ‘20 goes through 
As a newly minted bridge expert, it was the design as a "fracture point bridge" that led to its failure. Essentially there is no redundancy in the safety systems, so when one critical piece of infrastructure goes down, the whole bridges collapse
As a non MC student, I am aware that the Hebrew translation uses a generic word for fruit. When translated into Latin, the word "malus" was used, but at the time malus meant apple, fruit, and evil, so it was a three part word play. Apple was historically referenced in future literary artworks and paintings
As a non participant, I also assumed that John would have made a reservation 
As a non Western Masser, I know that that’s Old Stone Church in WEST Boylston
As a non-playoff contender, probably the worst idea ever suggested in this groupme

As a public health student, we used a lot of what the WHO published as gospel throughout many of my courses. But between this and the Ebola crisis, it's clear they can't handle emerging infectious diseases 
As a recent (i.e. last season) listener of the Athletic Football Show, I need Dan and Marc to join The Athletic to bring their brand of football podcasts to mellow out the tapeheads 
As a registered Democrat, @jordanbot only likes free money when the government gives it to him

As a rich, I have decided that I am only eating from minimum 6 course tasting menus from now on 
As a society
As a son of two teachers, I 100% understand the fear of going back to school, especially when these transitions back to the classroom are rushed and done without adequate preparation (not saying that's the case everywhere). However, you can't have it both ways, you dummies. Live remote teaching sucks (my opinion from being on the student side for 3 months) but you can't refuse that option if you already refused the alternative.
As a spectator (and probably as a player), I would feel like I had a sense of closure with playoffs. Without, it's just like meh I guess the season is over. Like can you imagine going into week 15 and already clinching the championship?

As an aside, anyone else personally offended when your professor uses comic sans as his ppt font?
As an aside, I have a signed Suns stoudemire jersey. I'm assuming that's worth like $1200 right? 
As an MD MPH JD, @LiChan al Gaib is right
As an MD/mph student, I think it's more acceptable for me to idolize Paul Farmer 
As an offensive lineman, how do you accidentally line up in the backfield 
As an outsider in this conversation, I have no idea which side I agree with. Such a difficult issue 
As an unbiased GroupMe member, I can confirm that those screenshots prove that Bock is a massive hater \
As an underpaid and underappreciated resident, I think expenses made for my benefit count as charitable donations 
As another quick aside, you wouldn't believe how many people our age go to hospitals for psych issues. I treated probably a dozen kids I went to high school with at my old job, and Olivia routinely gets college patients on her floor at MacLean. It doesn't take much to get yourself admitted 
As any good detective knows, however, you can't stop at just one suspect
As backwards as he was, I think Simms cares. He literally said "if he wasn't good, he wouldn't be playing in this league anymore" in a way that criticized the culture of the NFL. Where if you produce, I don't care what else you do 
As Becker said 
As best as I can tell, as of November, there were multiple countries reporting hundreds of confirmed reinfections each 
As best as I can understand it 
As Bocker and Jordan golf on the regular, I denounce Bocker for supporting Nazism
As Bocker said, I have more school pride based on how we rank academically compared to other schools than I do with us beating USC in football. School rank is what is going to help you get a job after college, make money, have money to invest donate back to school, etc. Sure sports are entertaining but I guarantee a sports program is not why an average student is choosing where to go to school, especially in the northeast
As Bocker said, it would be nice to know what "very rare" means
As Bocker said, the Stanley mugs are definitely a 2023 thing. Every nurse in my department has had them for months 
As both a Married and Reproductive Fuckhole, I denounce cheating on all forms 
As CEO of Ross, it sucks that you hate Catholics and love terrorists 
As confident in that as I am that bocker got trade raped 
As discussed previously on this groupme chat, I was given permission from the commissioner to cancel my scores before I left the testing area. I made use of that right, so you will not be seeing scores. 
As do the Cowboys
As does Joe at investing. Also college sports.

As goody said, Siena is objectively not a color 
As he should. Right on time to dash goody's hopes and dreams 
As I am not a Danny Dimes believer, if Saquan is out, I believe the Giant won't score another touchdown all year 
As I am*
As I eat my mac and cheese with bacon, fried chicken, and bbq sauce....

As I will be in clerkships, I will not be able to attend regardless of price

As it was, my landlord bought our unit for $630k in 2016, so he's barely making anything off of it
As Jerry S would say, they know how to take the reservation, but not keep the reservation. Shame. 
As Jordan said, focus on the trenches to protect your future QB 
As Kovin's eternal roommate, I can confirm that he is in fact a Vampire. That's why I woke up one night to a red mess all over his bed, the floor, his pillow, and the toilet bowl
As Kovin's lifelong roommate, I can confirm that he's more of an ookie cookie guy 
As Kovin's medical proxy, I can report that in fact has died 
As Kovin's roommate, I can confirm that he's a big orgy guy 
As lame as it sounds, I would recommend keeping a journal of when the pain occurs, what you were doing, where the pain is located, how long it lasts, etc 
As little as I can be a troop hater, just wanted to be the LAST to wish our resident troop a safe deployment today if you haven’t left yet The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) 🫡🫡🫡
As long as all 450 of lucks passing yards go to Allen as well 
As long as Biden forgives my loans 
As long as Brady is under center, the offense will find a way to work. Stack that d with talent and the worse thing that happens is you end up undefeated like the Broncos with a qb who has a soggy egg noodle for an arm 
As long as China has Stephon Marbury, they shouldn't care what the NBA does 
As long as I have Chipotle Away, we are all good
As long as it's after 8 pm on Saturday, I am down for any blackjack-hooker party 
As long as it's not at the time where I promised other friends I would make a zoom for them  
As long as it's the same Yolanda 
As long as Jboss still comes
As long as Joe and Marcus hold on to their leads, doesn't matter 
As long as my vaguely Mexican/Italian/Middle Eastern friend Bocker can make it into the US without being cavity searched and detained, I agree with whatever policy is in place
As long as they aren't infants, it's fine
As long as they don't skip leg day
As long as they tell Vince McMahan and Dana White to stop hosting events with crowds during the pandemic 
As long as we can agree to burn jersey to the ground (sorry chan) and rebuild our own jersey shore. That way we can ensure that all visitors have access to rum ham 
As long as we keep Kelly Olynyk, we'll be ok. 
As long as you are arguing against college football, I am 100% in support. I don't need to hear your argument 
As long as you didn’t steal yo boss’s girl, I think you’re good 
As long as you rerack your weights, you're not a selfish asshole and you can't get coronavirus
As long as you tell me that it's for me, I will feel satisfied 
As long as your mom brings her friend who helped you move in junior year 
As many as you want
As Marcus never attended this university, likely does not give money philanthropically, and only is associated with it through fandom for of their football team, this gesture CLEARLY reflects what we think about Marcus as a person.
As mentioned previously, my stats professor hates 538 because he hates Nate Silver 
As mentioned previously, this is both a bad week and bad choice of location for me. And for those reasons, im out 
As Morcus would say, do you really trust that the government isn't going to fuck this up?
As much as I hate to criticize one of the best pieces of film to ever be produced, bill simmons was the worst person to choose to play that part 
As much as I like it now, Nate Tice (who now writes for Yahoo sports) was the cohost up until a year and a half ago and he was phenomenal. Best person I’ve ever heard combine in depth analysis with an uncanny ability to simplify it for the average football fan.
As much as I love monument, I will pass 
As much as I love this "hate on Becker" thing we have going, I think we are all losing sight on how awful joe is. 
As much as I want Becker to lose, I think he's going to enjoy going to Mohegan sun too much 
As much as I want to make fun of you for having a bad team, you have no influence on Emyr’s horrible performance 
As much as I want you to be made whole, I also kind of don’t want them to pay 
As my hero Tom Brady would say, QBs need to protect themselves 
As neither side has shown that they can effectively compromise, I stand by my comment.
As of last night he was still in the hospital 
As of today when I checked my mailbox, Marcus was always my friend 
As one of the self appointed best cooks in the GroupMe, I am offended that I am not considered someone with good taste
As one senator put it, "the Senate is becoming the House" 
As one who will not be betting and thus has no biases, I will volunteer to maintain a list of all bets. If that is agreeable

As someone who is currently trying to better myself, this isn't how you do it 
As someone who is not good at anything and is also very poor, I cannot fathom dropping $1500 on a poker tournament with any expectation other than to be served a divorce 
As someone who lives in Boston full time, we are the laughing stock of sports fans here. I can't tell you how many times I've met people who automatically take digs at BC football when they find out I graduated from there. It's embarrass 
As someone who pays for oil heat in an older house with a really old furnace, I am fully on #TeamEnvironment
As someone who played defense my whole soccer career, any game with <5 goals is not worth watching
As someone who played soccer, it's super fun to play but it really isn't nearly as fun to watch, IMO
As someone who was all over the place in my argument with Morcus not more than 15 minutes before this discussion, I understand lol. Also just want to reiterate that I didn't mean to take away from any of the experiences you, your family, or Asians in general have experienced.
As someone who watched one at bat during the regular season, I think Cora should have brought Chapman in to pitch the last out of the 8th 
As someone who works in healthcare, insurance is that bad. 
As someone with a chronic intestinal disorder who does research on bowel diseases, I second Becker's recommendation. I go twice on a normal day, up to 4 times if I eat a lot of dairy 
As someone with no real income nothing to claim, turbotax's free service has been adequate for the last several years. Never needed an expert though
As someone with the leverage, I do not endorse keeping the SAT as the punishment.

At MelWak, I hated days because the charge nurse Monday-Friday was a nurse in her 70s who hated everything anyone ever said or did. Everything was wrong. But she refused to retire and just tortured me and all the other techs for 8 hours everyday. It seemed like most of the older, slower, crotchety nurses were tenured to that M-F 7a-3p schedule and never had to deviate from it.

At the risk of being shamed by famed movie critic @Matt Levine’s Parrot, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the new Will Ferrell movie
At the risk of creating more heated GroupMe arguments, maybe we shouldn't be accusing each other of racism for our varying political views. I recognize my previously contribution to this narrative as destructive to the many friendships that I have and hope that the GroupMe can continue to learn from and support each other while bringing about discussions that enhance our collective understanding of issues regarding race and social justice.
At the risk of pulling a Chan...
At this point he is probably too far removed from the league. 
At this point, I am not sure that I can trust anything that @Lin Chanuel Miranda  tells us. He is clearly trying to cover something up. I think that we have to solve the mystery of the #ThirstTrapShooter💁🏻‍♂️📸 by ourselves.
At this point, I don't know if it's actually @AbadBot's birthday or not 
At this point, I honestly don't care.
At this point, I just assume that all JBs are AG
At this point, I think the issue is with Goody's expectations of the work environment, not with his coworkers' dedication to their jobs.
At this point, why not combine them and make a single “Scouts” organization? Everyone learns to start a fire, to survive in the wilderness, to help an old lady cross the street, and to pressure mentally weak individuals (and Darrow) to purchase cookies 
At this rate, you'll actually be able to afford your half of the mortgage

Baseball being a game to "put on the background" is exactly why it is losing traction. The game isn't exciting enough to capture attention. If all the games matter, it will start to shift in the right direction
Baseball has the hardest cap. That's why the Red Sox had to trade away their MVP 
Baseball is always on in the background
Baseball is bad, and should feel bad, because it suffers from the issue of not every game mattering. You could not watch for a month and there is a chance that your team didn't do anything to change its place in the standings.
Baseball managers don't matter. Convince me otherwise
Baseball would be infinitely more fun if the infield dirt was actually a moat filled with crocodiles and hippos. Every infield player has to travel in a kayak, but they have a butterfly net instead of a glove. The outfield would be a corn maze that fielders had to navigate through to field the ball. A home run results in a player from the other team being taken out of the field of play, like a red card in soccer. Pitchers are fined $50,000 for every new baseball they request and if a player steps out of the batter box, the other team's dugout has a right to pelt him with lacrosse balls

Basketball is over. Let's talk about the looming NFL minicamps 
Basketball is too long of a season. We should just cancel it all together 
Basketball isn't a real sport
Basketball isn't anything more than a pickup game played in front of dumb spectators, so debating the "bamboozledness" of trades is a useless exercise 
Basketball people: "let's trade one of our best players, that will surely make us better" 
Basketball playoffs are long enough to be their own season. They don't need any more teams in
Basketball talk. Perfect time to go into airplane mode 
Basketball*
Basketball: Did you play for the same team for more than 2 years? Number retired. Did you score 1000 points in your career? HoF
Basketball: top 12 sport at best 
"Basketball:
Curry
Lebron
Durant
Anthony Davis
Leonard"
Bass's kick was obviously terrible but Allen was v bad on the previous 3 play sequence. Bad throws, bad decisions.

BB loves Mark Bavaro 
BB might be a fucking genius. Need a fucking replay here 
BB murdering Sam Darnold, again 
BB said in an interview this week that he won't challenge PI because he knows he won't win. The fact that other coaches haven't learned that after 7 weeks is insane
BB still #1
BB tapping into the DL pipeline from Northwestern Missouri University. Can't wait

Be careful about laughing. You may miss your wizard drop 
Be careful about making these jokes. You don't want to be blackballed by the cabal. I hear they ban you from all Ross stores
Be careful becks, I've seen Jordan punch a wall for less. And that cost him money. Punching you would be free 
Be careful chan. You don't want to incur the wrath of the fantasy gods, especially with such an injury-prone running back 
Be careful goody. Becker could sue you 
Be careful what you ask for with goody, John

Beautiful screen pass 
Beautiful throw by Allen, great catch too 
Beautiful throw into double coverage 
Because #FuckTheRules2.0 I would concede that the ners would be my next nomination if I couldn't nominate the pats 
Because acquiring AJ Mcarron is worth celebrating....
Because Asians hate Jesus? 
Because AVP has no ability to install concepts on his own
Because baseball statistics are not team oriented 
Because Bill is going to pay OBJ 20mil but won't pay Cooks 8.5mil
Because browns 
Because Chin, while in this context referring to the anatomical position inferior to the mouth, is also a stereotypical Asian surname. Therefore Chan, who is the most racist out of all groupme members, is making a claim that Marcus is racist by including "Chin" in his groupme name 
Because computers aren't waterproof, Nick. God get your head out of your ass 
Because despite his GM doing everything he can to bring in the talent he clearly needs in order to win, he still can’t win. 
Because despite your efforts to help Kovin cheat by jinxing me, I have no intention to lose 
Because every time someone asks a question about the league, no one answers
Because everyone has a constitutionally protected right to choose their leaders. 
Because everyone has the weekends off from work... 
Because first and foremost, they are people first. They aren't their illness 
Because Fleming was always the backup to the backup, and they use him when they bring in an extra OLineman. Waddle has a higher ceiling but is hurt easier so they’re playing Fleming over him probably to manage Waddle’s time 
Because GoogleDocs don't have logs that track every update
Because GroupMe not lit, I have some news to share. Olivia and I were pre-approved for a physician mortgage loan yesterday. We will be looking at about half a dozen houses this weekend. There is one we really like (from seeing it online) and if it plays out well today, we may put in an offer. 
Because he beats dogs. I get it 
Because he drives like he's running out of time 
Because he has 73 passing yards with 9 minutes to go in the fourth. 
Because he is frequently in horny jail 
Because he is going to be he next best receiver/kick returner 
Because he is surrounded by people and a political party who continue to support him, no matter how vile he is.
Because he stepped up when we needed him most 
Because he sucks and his teams go 7-9
Because he was a white guy who was in the military and played baseball. That's the type of guy Marcus fawns over
Because he was never caught. Just suspected 
Because he wore a letterman jacket to a Monday night game against the pats and got destroyed
Because he’s on IR...
Because he's excited to tell us about the deal. Keep doing you, John 
Because he's fat 
Because he's going to leave in a year and they're not better than golden state right now, so why bother staying with the team 
Because he's in the gym, working harder than anyone else
Because he's too old to marry another rich woman to steal her fortune
Because his most famous role is planes trains and automobiles 
Because I ain't a bitch like Marcus is 
Because I am a poor, and extremely bored and have power tools that I wanted to learn to use, I decided to build instead of buying. It was similar in price to buying used stuff from Craigslist 
Because I am hungry for more wings, if you jump offsides during a hardcount, your coach should be allowed to cut off one of your toes
Because I am not a big baller
Because i appreciate Bocker’s chirp 
Because I don't have a mortgage, duh
Because I don't have any good keepers and I feel left out :(
Because I don't have disposable income. Or income.

Because I was bored in budgeting and management class

Because I was so light, I was the easiest kid to tombstone
Because I wish she held my shaft 
Because if I pick a matchup that is riskier, I have a higher chance of being eliminated this week and not getting any money anyway 
Because if it was hacked from their phone, they didn't purposely circulate it 
Because if someone turns in your presence, you want to be stuck on a vehicle hurdling through the sky
Because if you wait til the offseason, the Celtics can theoretically explore deals which could increase competition and drive up his price
Because I'm unoriginal and stole Jordan's model and adapted it for my own purpose 
Because it bites your face while you sleep, shits in your wound, and bounces without even making you coffee in the morning 
Because it breaks parliamentarian tradition and makes it easier for whoever is in power to appointment members to the SCOTUS. The senate has always had protection for the minority party; that's pretty much dissolved now 
Because it currently is not lit
Because it ends with you not being able to fit into your pants? 
Because it is a legitimate fact that they are. Not all black people are poor, but they are significantly more like to be poorer than a white person from the same neighborhood. It's a proven demographic fact.
Because it makes you feel dumb? 
Because it would have missed further right 
Because it's college football 
Because it's in the middle of the desert
Because it's less competitive to charge the consumer more money. It's a business market and more consumers will go to cheaper care centers. My insurance charges me more money for a copay for providers that charge more money for their services. They basically direct me to the cheapest care centers 
Because it's open news for everyone. I assume Joe would have heard by the tonight. And I need the instant gratification of laughing at Joe 
Because it's Wednesday 
Because I've been subjected to them and others have been allowed to simply just not do the punishment. I can't support something that isn't going to be applied fairly and universally.
Because I've eaten out the last two nights and I'm starting to feel like Marcus 
Because Joe likes it 
Because Joe lives in Boston 
Because John, jordan sent you a smiley emoji so clearly he wants to fuck you on the side of mt Washington 
Because literally every other reservation slot is booked. I'm trying to book our group before we lose out 
Because making an argument that basically only Marcus agrees makes you seem so much more intelligent
Because Mookie took one off the hip last night 
Because my three starting running backs are I jured 
Because no chance they get nesn
Because no one knows the current rules, let's say $22
Because no one wants to waste a top 10 pick on a player who is going to be spending games suspended on the sideline for doing stupid shit 
Because nothing that was ever said suggested that Becker and Maggie dated 
Because of Bocker's union 
Because of Daz!
Because of failing to pass healthcare or taking private jets with taxpayer money? 
Because of his huge nose?
Because of leadership he displayed 5 years ago when on a trip to Israel
Because of my testicular cyst, I have gotten several intimate dick and ball exams. I can confirm that it is very hard to get a boner. Lots of shriveling happening when some Eastern European dude is applying cold gel to your taint to do an ultrasound 
Because of stroke risk ^^
Because of the AirPods 
Because of the glasses?
Because of three games? No. 
Because of Tito or because you want Cubs fans to suffer?
Because of what Goody is arguing
Because people like @Joey Brackets  voted for him twice
Because people pay money to go to games to see them play. Because abc and espn show a lot of nba games and people won't tune in if stars aren't playing, so they'll lose viewership. 
Because people who have had rona can still get rona again 
Because Reddit is always right, one guy on Reddit says that the Blackhawk was instructed to cross the flight path after the AA flight landed. They were told to keep a visual. But allegedly they were looking at the wrong plane, thought that they had space, and tried to cross 
Because serving in an apparently disposable position in the executive branch makes up for missing out on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court 
Because she said she “wasn’t ready for another relationship even though I really like you” only to date someone like Tyler a month later 
Because she's married to Morcus? 
Because she's over 18
Because sports and friends aren't worth it for you and you quit on both
Because taxi services likely already exist in those areas 
Because teams were jumping at the chance to sign Michael Sam 
Because that’s not within the standard rules @Marcus Bauer 
Because that's an RCT that will get approved by an IRB]
Because that's totally plausible 
Because the around the NFL podcast didn't pick the Bears the week before the Fuckholes did or anything....
Because the BC career center doesn’t care about non-CSOM students because they don’t have any money to donate to the school 
Because the Celtics collapsed? 
Because the fix is in
Because the fix is in*
Because the NFL sucks Jerry Jones' penis 
Because the Pats are the most important team in the nfl 
Because the system isnt there to protect the best teams. They don’t have a right to win the championship. If you’re better, then prove it and win the game 
Because then it’s him abandoning the lakers and not the lakers abandoning him
Because there is a living, breathing commissioner who is trying to make changes to the game that benefit fans? 
Because there is no way pats are signing him for more than what Oakland, jets, etc offer him 
Because they are a) sick of this shit; b) can get paid more to work as a travel nurse
Because they dont let him!
Because they either come in in custody or not 
Because they trade them for players 
Because they were busy sucking Chris Johnson's dick 
Because they were on the team and could be disciplined for posting stuff like this on Facebook, probably 
Because they're poor 
Because they're public school teachers and charter schools have a reputation of taking funding from public schools 
Because they're the Bears 
Because those of us who are bad managers didn't have good keepers a few years ago. That made us pay more for the non-keeper players who were still on the board, effectively preventing us from ever having good keeper values. Now the top two or three teams control all of the top players and it's honestly not very fun to get stuck with a suspended running back as the best available 
Because we are the best 
Because we hate each other\
Because we talked about it last night (or are you asking why Becker added badger?)
Because we were told they expected to sell it by January and the realtor is literally telling potential investors to raise the rent after they buy it
Because we're the two best teams, John. Have faith in yourself 
Because you are all waiting on my every word, Halo 4's gameplay is great but the story is subpar thus far.
Because you are such a good friend, I am happy for you that he made that kick 
Because you are the one who benefits
Because you didn't bring us as your +1
Because you didn't come on the Zoom call early enough last time
Because you don't have money 
Because you gave me shit last time, Ryan you're more than welcome to come to the bar in Stowe that I will be at. 
Because you have HIV? 
Because you proved me wrong. That's the lowest of low right there 
"Because you skimmed, Jboss:
Joff Savarino:
Jboss, how did you get all the brains and talent and Patriots fandom and good looks while your older brother was left with nothing?"
Because you think it's protecting you, you actually put yourself at more risk by using it incorrectly
Because you think you'll be the 5th team
Because you told me that my question to bocker was insensitive when I was just trying to liven up the gorupme. Now we got #TaxTalk
Because you touch yourself at night
Because you touch yourself at night
Because you weren't wearing pants 
Because you’re a moron 
Because you’re really going to use that $5 really wisely....
Because you're awake

Becker doesn't normally go this long without starting an argument in the groupme. I'm slightly concerned for his well being

Becker learned for years under Marcus, the master of arguments, that the best way to win an argument is to yell really loudly. That will serve him well in any commissioner debates.
Becker likes to browse /r/all instead of his front page. 
Becker loses a starter, starts someone in the hospital, and watches the patriots pull a win out of their ass. It's been a great day

Becker told me he'd use the money to buy me dinner when I come to interview at his school, otherwise I'd be super pissed

Becker was correct 
Becker was fapping it the whole banquet. Made me uncomfortable. 
Becker went to an MIT frat party. The next night, he hyped it up to us, so we got a group of us to go. Traveled all the way to MIT and there were no parties to be had; frat row was completely empty. No one was even walking around. So we decided to walk/run the distance back to campus. Got bored. Stopped for uburger. Took the t from bu back to bc. Forever have Becker shit for lying to us

Becker, as a Giants fan from January 2012 until February 2012, how do you feel about the report that tom coughlin is going to resign on Monday
Becker, don't you have a 35 page thesis that you should be writing?
Becker, give me back duke Johnson so I can trade him to Ryan for luck 
"Becker, I agree with chan's view because my work situation isn't exactly private. I never log into the browser, but I'm in tight office quarters and any pictures or gifs could be seen easily on my phone. However, the groupme is based on free speech so if posting big black dicks tickles your fancy, that's fine with me. I definitely don't think you're wrong at all in that regard. If those pictures come up, I just don't open up the groupme for an hour and hope it calms down. I will reiterate that it would be super helpful to have a nsfw tag, but I won't be leaving the groupme if that doesn't happen. 

Tldr: he overreacted, but his point is valid and we should all be friends "
Becker, I glad that I provided you with the strength needed to overcome your adversity 
Becker, I regret dropping Eli manning. I don't like my quarterbacks. Can I have him back?
Becker, I watched your team for two hours before a game once this year because you were starting an inactive player and I did not say anything 
Becker, I will never want you to ever support me with anything 
Becker, I would say that you could have the bobblehead two days a week, but that would require me to see you on a biweekly basis. So fuck you. 
Becker, if you want to deal with the food thief, just bake cupcakes and lace them with either laxatives or rat poison (your choice). Wrote "do not eat" on the container and leave them in a public area. Guaranteed that the thief will take one 
Becker, I'll bench Wilson if you get Carrie Underwood to sit in my face 
Becker, I'm 1-0 against you this year. Talk shit when you beat me 
Becker, I'm going to skull fuck the shit out of your team this week. I'm on the fucking warpath after losing to jboss like that. 
Becker, I'm sorry you're stuck with Goody loving you.

Becker, why do you have this irrational hatred for other teams? What did they ever do to you expect go out and play a sport
Becker, why don't you send your thoughts here?
Becker, you ask for a qb for your running backs and then you deny everyone's trade offers. Can't have it both ways 
Becker, you haven't accepted my trade yet 
Becker, you should have posted he asshole piercing.

Becker. Beat you in both the games we had open. 
Becker. I am too upset to even gloat at the fact that I'm 2-0 against you this year

Before I catch up on all the missed messages, I have been in Vermont at Olivia's parent's house with no Internet since Thursday. Their cable company shut off their Internet on Wednesday. They told them it was a technical issue. They waited until a technician came out today only to find out that it wasn't a technical issue but instead it was an issue in their billing department where they mistakenly marked them as having several late payments despite them enrolling in auto pay and being debited on time every month

Being #TeamSoftBody is a risk factor
Being a bike advocate may be as bad as being a Nazi. 
Being a doctor is not a right 
Being a Fuckhole is not about being mediocre. It's about constantly claiming that you're the best and shitting on everyone else
Being a good human literally kills you 
Being a quitter yourself, I would have thought you'd be more sympathetic 
Being a skimmer does not equate to being the wildcard
Being a working parent is hard. 
Being able to read, interpret, and effectively implement evidence based research is not a skill most Americans have. Have you seen most Americans? 
Being able to walk down the street and get a spritz to go for 3 euro is a baller move. Go Italy go 
Being affordable is not a pro. We have to keep the poors out 
Being an adult who flies with a stuffed animal is immediately a gulagable offense
Being evaluated for one 
Being forced to watch the rewind of the royal wedding with Olivia's family instead of the Celtics 
Being friends with Bocker. 
Being from New Jersey would explain both the craziness and the sense of entitlement. Right Chan? 
Being in a groupme with goody is like walking through a mine field. You never know when you'll set him off and when you do, the whole groupme is fucked
Being in Iraq and blowing up Iran is not an excuse for skimming 
Being Mortal by Atul Gawande is an amazing read for anyone interested in end of life care
Being murdered is also a disability
Being narcissistic doesn't mean you definitely have NPD. It's a special type of Trump-esque narcissist that gets diagnosed 
Being on the Yankees will do that to you
Being on this earth with you is my heaven 
Being on vacation in Europe for two weeks with friends with whom you have replaced us might have contributed to the problem.....
Being president of the US sucks. Being leader of the Fuckholes is an honor, and you dragged it through the mud and took a shit on it 
Being stuck in the middle of the ocean with a ton of people who don't know including a billion kids that are all incubating every disease known to man? Pass
Being wrong is a state of mind, just like being poor

Ben McAdoo to the Pats would be one of the worst things to happen this off-season

Ben Rice? Yeah, who grows up a Yankees fan in Massachusetts 
Ben Volin is the worst Boston sports reporter besides Dan Shaughnessy

Better than when we used to get penalized for a pick 6 even though the defense wasn't even on the field 
Better that than trying to find new friends
Better then I thought I would tbh
Better to just bear hug a bus
Better without Jimmy G
Better yet, someone go to the dark web, save the naked pictures, and post in the groupme

Bobby Bonilla was owed $5.9 million when he was released. The Mets took a deal for deferred payments because the owner was making more money off of a Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme than the interest on Bonilla's contract. Instead of paying the $5.9, Bonilla ends up getting paid almost $30 mil. It is lol Mets because the owner is paying 5x the value of the contract because was too invested in a pyramid scheme

Bocker, are you coming to dinner on Saturday 
Bocker, are you depressed? All the things that once brought you joy now make you sad 
Bocker, calling me your coworker implies you actually did work 
Bocker, can you crunch some numbers for me? How many games of monopoly have you and I dominated together?
Bocker, can you pick me up from Valhalla Int'n Airport when I land tomorrow?
Bocker, could you please bring Ricky to your NYE party. Him and I haven’t bonded in a while 
Bocker, did you go into work today 
Bocker, did you kidnap JJ as leverage? 
Bocker, do you feel at all threatened that Big Dick Rick is in your chick’s bed every night? 
Bocker, don’t let your hatred for the Red Sox blind you to the truth 
Bocker, don't tell anyone, but I miss having you in the office. Come back to me 
Bocker, former Yankees fan, has now renounced his love of baseball. Much like he renounced his support for all seven football teams for which he used to root.
Bocker, have you ever been loved, cared for, or even tolerated since the day you were born? 
Bocker, how do you feel about us poaching your receiver, your corner, and your running back. Give us all your fucking skill position players 
Bocker, how do you feel after working for the first day in your life 
Bocker, how nervous does it make you that I've already worked 11 hours today? Still want to come in on Monday??
Bocker, hurry up and get to work so we can go get coffee and gluten-free snacks 
Bocker, I appreciate you trying to make it to Chan’s tonight. It really means a lot that you would try and go through the trouble. You’re a true friend. 
Bocker, I clearly qualified my opinion by saying I wasn't a homer so you can't say that I am being a homer.
Bocker, I don’t think that “according to Joe” is a smart way to end your statement 
Bocker, I have watched three sketchymicro videos and they are far more effective than our lectures. Thank you for always being there for me, unlike@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
Bocker, I still worked 40 hours, despite only working four days and had to leave early to see my grandma in the hospital. Lose my number and go back to work 
Bocker, I think you're misdirecting all your hatred for Joe towards me. 
Bocker, I understand that you’re fired up right now but that post does not violate your social media rules 
Bocker, I want you to know that Olivia and I will be over, I will actually see Kristen and apologize for missing her during the run, and to not worry about anything gluten free related because I couldn't pass up el pelon 
Bocker, I wasn't being sarcastic. I thought to myself, if Bocker gets faster than me, I'm going to have to jump off the Tobin. That was motivation enough to get to the gym 
Bocker, I’m going to drop AB and Fournette. They’re all yours buddy

Bocker, i'm sorry about your situation. I have nothing more to add than our other friends, but I agree that you should feel zero responsibility for your brother's lack of motivation and your parents enabling attitudes.
Bocker, in case you didn't notice after this weekend, no one in this groupme cares about either of us enough to hang out with us. They'd rather sit at home than see their "friends" go off to medical school 
Bocker, Kristen, Joe, Marcus (not Shelbie though?), Joff, Olivia...that's six. Anyone else?
Bocker, shhhh. You never point out the flaws of your own arguments in this GroupMe
Bocker, take your L 
Bocker, thank you for referencing something and posting a link to what you were referencing simultaneously
Bocker, that’s just insensitive. He just lost his job and now you’re trying to get him to blow all of the money he has left 
Bocker, that's why you pay someone to help give you investment advice. Someone who went to school for many years and got licensed to give that sort of advice.
Bocker, they let me into medical school. I'm pretty sure being licensed to practice anything means nothing

Bocker, you could pretend to be Muslim, Mexican, or Italian. Whatever would help your case. You're the ultimate wildcard candidate. 
Bocker, you have neurosyphilis. There kovin, I diagnosed it 
Bocker, you might not want to be anywhere near Boston this weekend. I’m not sure you’ll make it through the weekend 
Bocker, your explanation is pretty much exactly what Olivia did when we started dating. I had never been skiing but she grew up on the mountain. She spent years teaching me so we could enjoy it together. She still skis alone when I'm not around but it's not something we enjoy to do together despite me having zero experience 
Bocker, your team is great and you're a great person. 
Bocker, you're not going to win this. You're just giving more ammo to goody to continue this argument 
Bocker. Always having the greater good in mind

Bold for me 
Bold move. I respect that. 
Bold prediction time: Texans take Jimmy G off the Patriots hands for 2017 first and second and 2018 second and third. Patriots trade Butler and a 2017 second for Sherman and a 2017 fourth 
Bold prediction. Mariota and Winston will start less than a combined 12 games this season 
Bold prediction: Beckham finishes with three catches for 42 yards. Book it. 
Bold prediction: Marcus will post about MACtion later tonight and be unaware that this conversation took place (already proven wrong, but I will post this anyway) 
"Bold predictions for the game:
1) Pats put up 60
2) Jeff Fischer permanently bans Bill Belichick from the side line at Rams games
3) Jared Goff will cry at least twice during the game "
Bolden and Edelman with key third down drops. If only Brady could throw AND catch 
Bolden shouldn’t even be allowed on the team plane home 
Bolden’s only job on this team is to play special teams. He gets paid a lot of money for someone who literally only plays special teams. If he’s doing his job, fine. But he’s not. He’s had at least three really bad ST penalties this year, including one that could have lost us the game last night 
Bomani Jones and Stephen A. as well 
Bomb threat at bc. I think it was Becker, since it is wok away night tonight

Boris Johnson got the rona
Boris Johnson stepped down. The Tories chose Liz Truss as the PM. She sucked before she was appointed. Immediately after being appointed PM, she proposed a tax plan that was so unpopular, that the British markets plummeted. She fired her chancellor of economics. Despite that, her party turned on her and she stepped down 
Boris Johnson? More like Boris GONEson. Amirite?!

Both above the Dalton line, both franchise guys
Both are fair points. I can't believe uber has only been here for three years. That's incredible to think about 
Both are not rosterable
Both died 
Both FSU quarterbacks hurt 
Both games are miserably bad. 
Both have a ton of pros that I like. I think we would lean towards UVM, but Lahey would offer the opportunity to be on the ground floor of creating a new residency program and I could have a true leadership role in the growth of academics in the department; positive and negatives for both 
Both have been guilty for weeks 
Both Joe and Kovin waking up with Easter egg all over their faces 
Both my grandfather's died before I was born. Don't be so insensitive 
Both my parents are teachers. They deserve more but they also have three months vacation, as John stated 
Both my parents were teachers and reached their max retirement before I went to college. AIn't no inheritance coming to me
Both my parents were teachers. They worked hard. My mom would be working from 7 am to 7 pm pretty much every night. She's definitely an exception. Most of my friends from Melrose went into education and I wouldn't a few of them to teach me to tie my shoes, let alone how to assess the complicated geopolitical climate during the American revolution 
Both of jboss's starting quarterbacks might be out next week. 
Both of Jordan's are wrong. Texans yes 
Both of the DLinemen that Pats have acquired will probably do well in the Pats system since they rotate their linemen constantly. 
Both of them would eat us before we could tackle them
Both of those were with Addazio 
Both offenses are modeled around running the football and have been limited by other teams when trying to pass....
Both parties agree to terminate it?
Both rounds should be over by 9pm at the latest 
Both soccer and basketball are fun to play and abysmal to watch
Both stir fry and salad have vegetables. 
Both teams' defenses are miserable*
Both the fantasy league and the nfl 
Both these teams are fucked if this goes to extras. Who else is available to pitch?
Both things can be correct
Both tufts and mgh have had to stop scheduling vaccinations due to lack of supply from the state. So that's nice 
Both weekends. However, next weekend doesn't include girls tournaments, so will likely be less busy

Brady gets no calls
Brady getting the ball back with 3:30 left? Hmm I wonder if he can pull it off 
Brady going after Telvin Smith in coverage. 
Brady got benched after one half of bad football last year. Yes he didn't lose his starting job, but bill loves jimmy g. If Peyton continued to throw picks, he would be pulled and jimmy would be put in 
Brady has objectively not been good but his receivers have objectively been some of the worst in the NFL, the OLine is bad, and the running game may be the worst that the Pats have ever had. That being said.....17-2. Book it. 
Brady has violated, state, municipal, and NFL policies. He's a loser and a fraud
Brady is a fucking vulture
Brady is a product of the system 
Brady is at war too. Except he won't stop until he has slept with goodell's wife over his dead corpse 
Brady is sneaky athletic 
BRADY OR LOSE 
Brady plays all three phases of the game 
Brady scrambles to the right and threw a pass to amendola who got past the coverage and probably had a td but the sideline judge blew his whistle as if Brady stepped out of bounds while the ball was in the air so the play was dead 
Brady sucks. He only has the most post season touchdown passes ever 
Brady takes a sack if someone so much as breathes on him 
Brady took longer to step up into that pocket than it takes @Skimmer to reply to a comment in the GroupMe 
Brady traded to Jaguars and gets 2 wins a season confirmed. 
Brady under center with one yard to go. Let's not put someone over the center so he can sneak for the first 
Brady went halfway down on his own 
Brady won't finish his career in New England unless because the Patriots will eventually need to move on and I think that will happen before Brady wants to retire. I can see Brady playing for another team for a year or two before retiring, and Bill coaching the pats without Brady for a year or two 
Brady would have gotten that call!!!

Broken collarbone. Book it

Broncos Chargers is not how you want your kids learning about football 
Broncos crushing uncrustables
Broncos D + $10 of Becker's draft money for teddy bridgewater. Deal 
Broncos d has 16 take always. Patriots d has 6. Peyton had thrown 10 interceptions on his own, three of them being pick 6s. He is the best option on a team where the defense can pick him up. No chance the patriots are anywhere near 6-0 if Peyton starts every game and throws 10 picks because our defense can't get the ball back. 
Broncos d looks good and manning may be physically handicapped but he is still mentally smart enough to not fuck up every game 
Broncos sign Bortles. AFC West is all but wrapped up now

Btw joe, sorry but I am on the plane waiting to fly back to Boston. Sorry to inconvenience you 
BTW, none of us are commenting often because kovins Hulu is 2 minutes behind 
Btw. Put up the most points all season second week of the posa. Go figure

1) Ryan and Emyr because of the friendship they formed while children in canton 
2) Kevin and John because of twin telepathy

5) Jamie and beer. Self explanatory
6) Jordan and Jill

but #notmynarrative
But @#JustFacts✅ already knew that 
But @The Big Dick Bandit isn't here anymore 
But a lot of the chefs on there are young and definitely not indicative of an entire lifetime of work 
But actually
But actually 
But actually congratulations! 
But actually, he is a great player and his absence will surely hurt the Chargers 
But actually, that's what happened 
But actually. Totally clear there was no way a hobbled quarterback could hit the end zone from where they were pinned. Made no sense to have a slow, lumbering tight end out on coverage 
But again, that could be wrong depending on state/county/city/hospital/day of the week/# of test kits/whether you are a Tots fan or not
But also also...Ashli...
But also because he did bad things
But also I understand and recognize the point you are making 
But also lose his number 
But also shoot up
But also, they just started construction at the possible site of a new stadium in Inglewood, which is where the Rams were thinking of moving 
But Amendola has taken three pay cuts in the past three years so it would kind of be in bad faith to trade him
But Andrew Yang is giving people free money 
But Anthony lynn should be fired for being awful 
But Anthony, the one guy on Twitter disagrees with you
But any country club that rejects Gisele supports terrorists 
But anyone around today to do something 
But apparently the Broncos are afraid to make a tackle on a QB to prevent a touchdown
But apparently the team didn't tell him to lose weight. Even though they did 
But apparently they overturned it?
But appreciate @Ass Ketchum responding 
But aren't those notifications default? 
But as a rich, goody doesn't pay taxes
But ask yourself. If you score the most points in the posa, did you really win?
But at least he has consistent receivers 
But at least I don't suck cock like joe Bourque 
But at least I'm doing something about it
But at least the T is cleaning their trains once a day now.
But at least your dick will be sucked so much you won't have to worry about carrying your excess sperm weight 
But at least you're not joe Bourque 
But before you ask, no he can't pitch 
But Bill Coughlin probably won't be in Providence this weekend 
But Bocker definitely still definitely texts him to invite him to do things like trivia 
But Bocker, the COVID-19 list and the 16 player practice squad were built specifically to mitigate any cases. Surely the NFL didn't need to do more to prevent a scheduling nightmare
But both will retire around the same time. I just don't know that Brady will play his last game in a pats uniform 
But brah, he couldn't take pictures.  Basically prison 
But brah, the patriots filmed the Rams walkthrough before the super bowl!!!!! That's why they won brah. They haven't won a Super Bowl without cheating
But Burrow got hurt on the second 4th down play 
But by then there were 54 seconds left or something and we did not recover the onsides kick. Which we were also offsides for 
But can you do a kickflip?
But Charlton hospital is in Fall River confusingly enough 
But congrats on your new position with her 
But congratulations 
But could he name their OL?
But Cruz was born in Canada!!!!!!1!
But Darrow would have to get famous on the bachelorette first in order for the show to be successful 
But Darrow, you already have one under armour shirt. Surely you don't need another one 
But do you just walk around all day at work catching Pokemon?
But Dobson has shown some promise today 
But does it provide you with a convenient way to track Pokemon?
But don’t worry guys, lipid metabolism was way more confusing for me than carbohydrate metabolism, and I have an exam in a week and a half. Be prepared for a ton of snaps
But don't act like you're not impressed 
But don't worry guys. We got Hoodie Allen our senior year 
But dude, he got to be the first one to hold a baby after it came out of a women's vagina. 
But everyone from Stowe still skis the goat glades anyway 
But everyone on Twitter is saying its extremely surprising 
But explaining it that way makes you look like less of a dick
But fewer shrooms still sending this even though goody beat me 
But for clarification, I definitely don't have a sister or a dog 
But for real, we probably shouldn't be body shaming people on here. Jordances with Wolves wouldn't be too happy 
But for serious, they are going to get blown out this week, so John, you should trade me their defense for my defense. Guaranteed to be an upgrade for you 
But fuck all of you anyway 
BUT FUCK GOODELL 
But fuck manning. He fucking sucks and the Broncos suck a load of cock 
But fuck the other guys! 
But fuck you 
But fuck you anyway john 
But fuck your anyway 
But given how big of a fan I am, I can guarantee you I will watch it 
But Goody is suggesting the opposite of TDE
But guys, the program was moving in the right direction. Don't forget that 
But he can't catch 
But he had cancer so he has to succeed in the NFL because the NFL needs a feel good story to make people believe they still care 
But he hates Mondays 
But he is getting cucked
But he judge has been hitting the NFL hard in court. Way harder than nflpa's side. He is really tearing them a new one and Brady's lawyers seem much more prepared and confident 
But he just sucks so hard
But he picked out the exact ring, just within the style she liked 
But he prefers running to sex
But he scored a touchdown tho 
But he should totally still get a statue at Penn State, right guys?!
But he was an nba all star!!
But he’s not a celebrity....
But her Fappening pictures are from when she was 17
But he's god's hero, so that's all that matters to him 
But he's taking you to the high school track
But he's to the former 
But he's too scared of his own power 
But hey, at least you didn't drop $51 on a waiver wire player you could have gotten for 3
But hey, they covered the spread! (Still don't know if that's the right lingo)
But hey, we're only down a field goal!!!
But his first wife said he had a thing with mick jagger
but his granddaughter is hot
But honestly I read it senior year, don't remember specific answers but remember the questions it strives to ask 
But honestly. Stripes. Meatballs. Kingpin. Space Jam.
But how do you feel about bats 
But how do you feel about having baseball on in the background
But how do you feel about our immigration argument 
But how does this affect LeBron's legacy 
But how much from @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
But how much is his mortgage worth?
But how will it affect LeBron's legacy 
But how will Marcus ever make the time for us with all of the studying he has to do for the exams he doesn't have? 
But I agree, it's bullshit that it's not right there anymore 
But I also agree with Nick in his first statement that even going that far gets someone labeled a socialist and is not politically viable.
But I also touch myself during the day 
But I also understand Becker's feelings and agree with his opinion for if anyone asks, liking your girlfriend is totally gay 
But I am compelled to hate Ryan a lot more now 
But I am doing work 
But I am fine with the mega jerk 
But I am moonlighting tonight and working Saturday and Sunday and Monday
But I am no longer there. I had to drive up to Portland to pick up my keys because they wouldn't give them to me when I move over the weekend 
But I am sacrificing time with them on Saturday to hang out with my real friends 
But I am trashing everyone so 
But I appreciate it  
But I appreciate the intellectual discussion 
But I can't say it
But I didn't take the SATs. I took the ACTs
But I do greatly enjoy Joe's analysis on my waiver wire transactions and hope to see it continue in the future 
But I do need their team to implode so we can trade for AJ Brown 
But I do not have a banana 
But I don’t start work until 3pm
But I don't analyze baseball because I don't understand that aspect of the game. Someone like Becker might be able to watch a guy pitch and understand exactly what is going on. Or understand why they are shifting a certain way 
But I don't read SBN?
But I don't shoot guns so I admit ignorance and probably a little bias  
But I don't think Hightower gets the ball again 
But I don't think that's the one becks is referring to. I remember talking about s different restaurant but I am drawing a blank on which one 
But I don't watch the show, so I don't know enough to dispute you 
But I enjoyed being able to enjoy football for football and not obsessing over whether every play went to my fantasy players or not. It was liberating as a fan
But I forgot that every terrorist at the Capitol was watching CSpan so it's okay because they probably already knew. The guy who wanted to put a bullet in Pelosi's head probably didn't need any info.
But I got my direct deposit
But I got trade raped, amirite?
But I guess that's more getting done than doing 
But I guess that's the same as an unmasked indoor dinner for hours 🤔
But I guess the GM CEO is also involved with Trump, and GM is partnered with Lyft, so the whole thing is a little incestuous and probably won't make any difference, which is why I included the /s
But I guess you don't want that either
But I hate Kovin more
But I have cake
But I have the weekend OFF BABYYYYY
But I have to go to work tonight and work all weekend 
But I have to work the next three nights 
But I have to work tonight, Sunday, and Monday 
But I have to work tonight. Also 4pm??
But I hosted the zoom call
But I just closed and reopened the app and its appeared 
But I just got a gf Nashville hot chicken sandwich and a milkshake so that's awesome 
But I miss you 
But I read it on Twitter....
But I really liked stanford 
But I still have to work
But I still have to work tonight and tomorrow night
But I think it's set 
But I think you missed the point that her parents named her Ashli and should be stoned to death for that 
But I thought Darrow took Angela?
But I thought that he was reaching to grab the baton
But I thought that NJ was the best place on earth 
But I thought that the Eagles and Rams traded for good qb's that each fit their systems?!?!
But I thought the 'cos were getting AR
But I thought the whole point was that he didn't eat asshole 
But I thought Trump was supposed to make me rich
But I usually like 🍑
But I vote nomar 
But I was at work
But I was just using that as an example. I notice it happens much more with oil 
But I was the first to wish him a happy birthday 
But I was told that Pitts/London/Robinson was the backbone of an elite offense
But I was told that putting business people in charge of hospitals was good for making money and caring for patients 
But I work today and the next 3 nights...
But I work tonight and tomorrow night
But I would support a punishment that was feasible that included volunteer work
But I wouldn't put Junior Attending Physician in my email signature like a Senior VP might put in theirs in the Kartel
But I’m on the other side of this so #NotMyNarrative 
But I'd never be mean like that to Goody. He has been nothing but nice to me for my whole life. 
But if anyone asks*
But if he’s not there he’ll get fined
But if he's injured, the +10 waiver value applies?
But if they didn't take it in the first place, I would never have lost it 
But if they take that money and sign a proven receiver or OL depth, then it makes sense 
But if this recent comment was directed at you, it would have occurred when he responded to you initially hours ago and not after someone else had asked 
But if you are anything like me, you will kill yourself two days into the trip from all the "happiness" 
But if you don't make contact, then it's legal no matter where it happens. Patriots receivers always make contact 
But if you wanted to fight with the Kurds, Bocker could have just hooked you up with his friend 
But I'll be on the clock from 7 am until 9 pm tomorrow, which will be fun 
But I'll totally train with you 
But I'm a moral person, so I won't give in to peer pressure 
But I'm at work 
But I'm going into work in an hour 
But I'm here 
But I'm in a lecture hall waiting to take an exam thinking about how I wish my school didn't have exams
But I'm not bitter.
But I'm on a flight 
But I'm still at work
But I'm still on vacation until Sunday
But I'm sure that someone as dedicated as you are went for a run after work. No? 
But I'm sure you've had more eventful evenings 
But I'm working this weekend 
But imagine how much more lit the Groupme would be if he didn't wake up
But in all honesty its darrows fault 
But in all honesty, chan is right on this one. I do agree with el pres (and A LOT of Boston sports writers and radio personalities) that JJ Watt is a narcissistic, self-obsessed asshole. He does a lot of fantastic charity work and I really think he does make a big impact on his community, but I hate the media swarm that takes every opportunity to report every little thing he does. I used to write it off as something that he could do nothing about, but in my opinion, he has let the attention get to his head and now he just tries to be over the top ridiculous in order to garner extra media attention 
But in all honesty, it was a great game. Congratulations to all involved 
But in all seriousness, I think investments in facilities are the way to go
But in all seriousness, they're making money for the school. They deserve a cut. Enough of this "play for the love of the game" bullshit
But in terms of bed space and stuff, we will likely have three rooms to spread out in and really won't be in the way. 
But is their a rule change that will bring you back to the league? 
But it feels good getting my second win ever against you 
But it is in long form formating?
But it is the best city in California, and the best team in California
But it's 12:46 pm on a Thursday 
But it's also after Goody's bedtime 
But it's how a 32 year old man pretending to talk like a kid would use the term 
But it's not Covid and Kristen isn't sick 
But I've also heard by Houston and Dallas aren't bad by any means 
BuT jAmEs HaRdEn!!! 
But Jim Christian is going to turn the team around right?! Especially with his recruits transferring right?!
But Joe told me that we were gunna win...........
But Joff, an elephant doesn’t forget 
But Joff, Chaim is a traditional Hebrew name meaning "Life," and you're being anti-Semetic by saying that it is a dumbass name.
But joff, clearly taken from off the porch 
But Joff, did you even show up to Bocker's rehearsal dinner 
But Joff, didn’t kraft try to get taxpayers to fund Gillette stadium? 
But Joff, didn’t you vote for 212 yesterday instead of your own nomination of 188
But Joff, didn't you already try to add him back? 
But Joff, didn't you binge BoJack Horseman on Sunday? 
But Joff, didn't you completely ignore working on that paper until after the Fuckhole zoom last night? Seems a little rude to call out Bocker in the GroupMe when you didn't do anything either.
But Joff, didn't you have a turkey sandwich for lunch? 
But Joff, didn't you just fix it
But joff, don't you know that Stephon Marbury retired last year and is now a coach
But Joff, don't you own a house that's a 5 minute drive from a secluded neighborhood beach that no one knows about except if you live here
But Joff, he was a doctor 
But Joff, he’s skiing, so maybe he isn’t looking at his phone 
But Joff, India's official languages are Hindi and English. "Scheduled language" just means that they are officially recognized as languages used in specific regions of India.
But Joff, it says he was a contractor, so he was actually a private employee.
But Joff, maybe you should read the updated terms of the contract which with bonuses, actually comes out to 3 years, $21m, including $8m on the first year and then an early team option to terminate. 
But Joff, Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara were on bye when Marcus lost to you
But joff, signing a free agent would be equally as expensive 
But joff, that looked like a clean hit 
But Joff, that was like two weeks ago. Surely the two aren't related 
But joff, that's six receivers 
But Joff, the Giants quit on him immediately before him coming to the Pats 
But Joff, the Patriots have a ton of cap space and surely would be able to lock him up to a long term deal, if BB so desires
But joff, there is another ice cream place called Christina's. Maybe they went there 
But Joff, wasn't it the FL senator and not governor? 
But Joff, you are in Maine. Fucking skimmer doesn't even know he's in Maine when he just said it 10 minutes ago.
But joff, you didn't watch the play well enough. It wasn't his man that made the tackle. Jimmy G actually pancaked his man 
But joff, you had one true patient in 8 hours today and he had shoulder pain. You didn't do anything to save him 
But Joff. Did you even eat dinner or go to the wine bar yet? 
But John Oliver is back and had a whole segment on them getting a deal. Is it a different union that went on strike at the same time?
But Jordan, the college football season and is new and exciting every year and so much parity exists that you never know who is going to win from week to week 
But Jubilant Joff is just going to let it go.
But kawhi doesn't want to play for them 
But keep your colon empty!
But leave it to @Bryson DeChanbeau to be opposed to being included on a list
But let's get real, they'll fucking suck. Shut em down 
But lets ignore that
But like I said, it's not a diet. It's a way to identify where you're unhealthy and where you can make incremental changes to make yourself healthier. Small things like picking ketchup with less added sugar or going for brown rice instead of white rice 
But like I said, there are other one size fits all n95s
But like say you graduate and don't declare for the draft. Once the draft is over, can you just sign with a team as a free agent or do you have to enter the supplemental draft?
But like the spin bike where I can adjust resistance and speed based on music 
But like, chapman has all off season to rest. Surely he's fine to pitch another inning 
But luffas are cool enough for all to enjoy 
But Marcus says that Addazio is a good coach
But Marcus trust's the browns offense for $30?
But maybe it's different for excess timeout 
But maybe you should. Time to be realistic
But Miss Peaches will never do any wrong 
But most of the other PCTs and nurses work their full time or more frequently than Olivia. Yesterday was her first shift in 2 weeks. So everyone else had already been given N95s and the stock was pretty much out
But moving prescription drugs to over the counter is a horrendous idea lol. 
But Mr. DiBlasi liked it
But my barber and his client both said that they liked Elon
But my bosses enrolled me in a biostats class through our research department. So once a week I get to sit in a class where there is no work and no expectation to understand more than the basics 
But naturally yes 
But new
But no. I guess goody is just destined to a career and life of severe depression and several relapses with alcohol and prostitution 
But not 100% of the time?
But not both because fuck them 
But not that it's truly definitive, the draft time is still set to Saturday at 7 pm 
But not worth it at this point
But obviously you photoshopped that before you returned to the groupme. 
But on a serious note, I hear northwestern Vermont is experiencing a tech renaissance.  The area is projected to surpass the GDP of silicon valley by Q3 of this year 
But on average, he was hit in the backfield. Have to make those tackles 
But on Tuesday night during his most recent round of attacks against windmills, Trump cited what appeared to be a brand-new reason people should avoid the turbines. “They say the noise causes cancer,” he told the crowd at the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual spring dinner, punctuating his impassioned rhetoric with hand gestures and an exaggerated imitation of the sound of windmill blades rotating.
But once you download the file, you it will start uploading it for others to download (Seeding). Just make sure you turn this off because it could slow down your internet connection and generally the people who get in trouble for torrenting are the people who are actually sharing the file, not necessarily the ones who are downloading it 
But only if CMC stays healthy
But only one of them is protected by the constitution. 
But other joff, that would be dumb because Gracie's is literally across the street from where they ate dinner 
But others contest that, thinking that the judge might ultimately say he has no power to overturn a decision due to article 46 of the cba 
But our fans don't stay for the full game if we aren't winning 
But please bring dessert 
But Prima did tell you that I sought her opinion on dinner last night? 🤔
But probably earlier than you guys 
But real talk. How did incest porn become the default 
But really, Vermont is great in the fall 
But really, why are the Mavs green 
But Rex gave him a big contract so he must be good 
But same opinions 
But Selena acts with old people. Isn't that funny haha 
But seriously I have watched the whole game and both teams are miserable. 
But seriously Vernon Davis to Broncos 
But seriously, -3 for a missed XP is fucking outrageous
But seriously, am only rooting against him because he's up against Matty Ice 
But seriously, for 24 mil in a single weekend, they couldn't get Tswift?
But seriously, I don't know how Doug Whaley still has a job. I also don't know how Jerry York doesn't find some way to repossess the niners. 
But seriously, I got a little riled up there. Sorry Chan. You have no idea how bad patriots Twitter was during the past 24 hours. 
But seriously, I lost both APs touchdowns and Keenan allen's touchdown and all of their yardage 
But seriously, what happened to @2020 Champion 
BuT sHe Is MoRe RePuTaBlE
But she represents Colorado tho
But she will be lucky if her Facebook friends actually see the pictures since they’re sandwiched between the 17 other posts she shares every hour
But she's wrong 
But six interceptions. Six. 
But steelers are officially filing a complaint with the NFL 
But Stephen A plays the race card. That makes him a polarizing talking head 
But still 7 pm?
But still, never admit you're wrong. Fuck that guy 
BUT SUCK IT 
But surely the Rs would not do that. States' rights and all
But tbh, he drafted from France last year and seemed to do fine
But Ted Wells said that Incognito was Hitler and that Martin was an innocent victim 
But thank you for responding
But thanks for the invite!
But that award "profiles a person, a group, an idea, or an object that for better or for worse has done the most to influence the events of the year" 
But that doesn't include the $600 front line worker bonus I got in November 
But that throw and catch with Burkhead tho
But that was a 5-95 ball
But that would never happen
But that's how Bocker "won" 
But that's just my opinion that I formed based on the opinions of others expressed in articles and tweets 
But that's not the format of a battle tag....
But that's ok, the prompt explained those things, if you took the time to read it
But that's the trade off with the lenders. You invest in residents and doctors who don't have large savings to put into down payments with the hope that you're buying cheap into a population that will be wealthy some day and have a steady income streak 
But that's two NFC teams...
But the 10% I saw didn't leave a good impression on me 
BuT tHe AaF 
But the administration doesn't want metal detectors because it would look bad 
But the apartment near John has been very lit
But the children who are lying about their age!!!
But the drive there is pretty sweet 
But the fact that (according to "reports") Homeland Security apparently had no say or time to plan logistically is pretty shitty
But the fact that Jordan doesn't know what bocker is talking about makes me feel a little better 
But the interception hasn't happened yet on my tv 
But the isolated social bubble I've surrounded myself with has been exclusively critical of his actions thus far, therefore everyone hates him. 
But the Israel trip 
But the more we talk about Yeezy, the better place the world is 
But the one time I did look in his fridge, it was 90% Bud Light...
But the patriots serve warm Gatorade so they are the worst team in football 
bUt tHe pSi
But the pundits think he should go first overall. When have hey ever been wrong 
But the punishment can't be overturned based on that. The NFLPA has to prove that Brady did not get due process and that the NFL was unfair in their ruling 
But the real question is: are the jets good? 
But the Red Sox can't score runs 
But the red Sox never sign large deals that end up backfiring? 
BuT tHe RePoRt DoEsNt MaTtEr
But the sixers have the #1 overall pick now....
BUT THE TV AND WIFI DONT FUCKING WORK STILL AND COMCAST WONT LET ME TALK TO A REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE ITS A KNOWN ISSUE
But the WNBA should market everyone equally 
But then all they need to win is a field goal. You are reducing the requirement to win the game just by putting a staggering offense on the field first 
But then Carrot won't see the city?
But then she called me Joe for the rest of college so I guess it didn't go well for me 
But then they will find the brain chips 
But then they will spend all their money on synthetic weed and fall out of third story windows!!
But then when I am wrong, I will look dumb
But then you relive you still won and it doesn't matter 
But then you'd have to wake up early 
But there are a lot of commanders in Washington 
But there was a twist 
BUT THERE WERE THREE OTHER PLANES 
But they all tried their best and that's what matters
But they already paged surgery so if they're wrong, someone is getting in trouble
But they also played to run the clock out on the last drive. 3 runs of less than one yard and gave GT the ball with a ton of time left. Didn't even try to get a first done 
But they are 2-1...
But they can just let him walk at the end of the season after they win the super bowl?
But they did make a couple of bad decisions. First of all, the initial coin toss. They should have kicked. Secondly, they shouldn't have played soft coverage on the first possession. That's exactly manning's strength 
But they didn't trade FLB2 away? 
But they didn't. Receiver running the pick didn't make contact but still slowed the corner enough to free up OBJ
But they don't seem to be citing a lot of strong data so I'm really not swayed 
But they haven't uploaded any super bowl videos 
But they heat the hallways/lobby and mildly heat the garage
But they play in Oakland currently. Not San Francistown 
But they seemed interested and me joining when one opens up, and he expects several to open up in the next few months 
But they were good enough to get me a win in the survivor pool 
But they're in billions of dollars of debt 
But this was before @ABot was in the GroupMe...
But those data are good news
But to be fair, cross contamination doesn't kill you 
But to be fair, I believe Ryan said that this girl had been to the MFA almost every weekend since winter break ended? Or was that the other girl. Too many girls 
But to clarify, am still around for dinner at 8 pm or later. Happy to meet you guys if you want to eat earlier 
But to him, he's meddling because the team sucks thanks to Bill. He probably doesn't think that his meddling is causing the sucking 
But took a long time to get back up 
But truly, I am not upset that Gregg stayed. I am upset that the three were put in a position where they had to choose. I am still mad at NFL media 
But trump says he's going to be tough on Wall Street 
But unlike LeBron James, you are actually vaccinated? 
But wait, I thought Tom Brady hated the Patriots
But we are going to score in the top of the 9th so it won’t be tie game 
But we aren't his friends? 
But we can certainly go back to the Panthers game when Luuuuuuke held Gronk in the end zone on the last play of the game, which wasn't called 
But we can disagree, that's ok. That's what the fuckholes are for
But we had it from K-12
But we have joe vellano....
But we have joe vellano.../
But we have the league's best coach
But we need to squad up still 
But we stole that ball from them 
But we took pictures for 5 hours. She finished with over 1500 photos
But we will see if they flake. Which they have done several times in the past few weeks, so it's possible I might be joining. 
But we're you firm in your pants 
But what about HuffPo?!
BuT wHaT aBoUt JoSh GoRdOn?!?1?!
But what about launch angle?! 
But what about LeBron's legacy
But what about the fact that he's the savior and much better than Cam Newton and is the future of the franchise? 
But what about the fat gamers
But what about the shirt, should that be complicated?
But what does it all mean
But what happens when the sauce is gone?
But what happens when you pick up a piece of produce and realize that it has a rotten spot? 
But what if you have to pay for parking?
But what Jordan does with his players is our business 
But what when a player plays well and #FitsMyNarrative? 
But what's the time of possession breakdown? Most important stay in football /s
But when are you going to apply to grad school? 
But when do you start at BC 
But when we bring back TB12 and Josh McDaniels and Dante Scarnecchia next year, we will be good for at least 5, maybe 9, more super bowls 
But where do we stand on the Loco plans? 
But which one 
But who do we have to beat to get nine wins? 
But who is going to buy the soccer ball?
But why male models
But why not first lieutenant
But will be there
But will jboss have phone service
But will*
But with an incapable backstage crew instead of an incapable host 
But with freeney hurt, we don't have depth to do that 
But wouldn't something like that delgitimize a whole season? 
But ya boi joff did his part and got tested before moving back to Maine 
But yeah I use my credit cards for everything and then pay them off right away
But yeah, I'm sure one person grabbed a bunch of tp and then someone followed suit and then everyone saw a shelf with not much tp stocked, so they panicked and started buying as much as they could 
But yeah, so lost everyone except for Kap pretty much 
But yes 
But yes he made a bad play call worse by being dumb 
But yes I agree that cider and beer are two different alcohol entities and should be treated as such.
But yes I did 
But yes, he went 3.1 with 5 ERs, 2 BBs, 3 SO
but yes, they bought a place and are moving now
But you are very handsome 
But you can also buy them 
But you can leave Bill Murray off your list?
But you didn't post it here 
But you didn't say where he matched so does it even contribute to the conversation?
But you didn't unlike it tho
But you didn't. Saugus went instead. 
But you guys are right that a year of communication classes aren't going to do much
But you have to pay money to play golf. Pokemon Go is free!
But you have to take the class
But you lost in the playoffs. Regular season doesn't count. 
But you pushed an elderly man who was clearly not in a position to brace himself to the ground, which is made of cement. What did you think was going to happen 
But you were the second
But your first name is Chan
But your point is valid 
But you're abetting your brother
But you're right that Infinite changed that 
But you're still am sheeple
But you're wrong 
But you've never been wrong about a pick in your life 
But, I'll do whatever the group needs. I'll just make sure to complain about it. 
But.......he was
But....he doesn't want to do that
But....that is objectively your prefix 
But...but...that doesn’t fit your #Narrative 
Butker misses wide left
Butler will be tendered with a first rounder (I hope). If anyone signs him away, I think BB is fine using the draft pick to draft someone to replace him 
Butt fumble 🐐
Butt plug
Butter til the pan begins to smoke, but not too hot. Pat scallop dry. Salt both sides. Pan seat for a golden crust. Don't overlook them. 
Butters brings people to the DMV to talk about their problems and founds a new religion around the government 
Buuuuut Joe Staley just retired so
Buy all of Tuscany 
Buy Hulu TV and add on the RedZone package 
Buy me w ps4
Buy out for BB is only $10m. Just saying 
Buy the bahn mi on an interest free loan and then flip it for a profit when our civilization devolves into a nuclear wasteland 
Buying tickets from stubhub would be $30. Can I get anything cheaper at the box office? I assume it's going to be more expensive there 
Buying Twitter for 44 bil was a bad business move 
BVI? 
BWW sounds good to me 
By accidentally, I mean I woke up late and then didn't eat anything until lunch around 1 pm and haven't had anything except water since dinner around 7
By all accounts, Mayo's contributions have been appreciated by the Pats, but he's only been there two years, and this year the LB core was essentially non-existent. I think his success is TBD. I genuinely think Slater would be a great ST coach because of how smart he is. Troy Brown has also been with the Pats a few years as an offensive assistant/WR coach, but again, I don't think you could call his work "successful" thus far. The rest of the suggestions were purely homerism.
By answering your question, bocker has consented to being called "medical nerd" going forward 
By Anthony, I mean anderson silva
By being a Fuckhole, you are entering a social contract to commit to spending time to the Fuckholes whenever there is a fathering. John Locke wrote about it. Get educated and do some reading. 
By being at my wedding, you were invited to get sexually assaulted 
By being dumb. He pulled him down 
By climbing wall I assume they mean top rope
By default, any muscle injury should be treated with RICE and if it doesn't get better, go see an orthopedic doctor to get an MRI 
By default, any trade involving Bocker has a loser 
By default, yes 
By far the worst character in the first three seasons. The Greek is #2 
By getting to know him 
By Kristina 
By my count, John, Nick, Jboss, Jordan, and Emyr are the only ones to have not been vaccinated or not announced their appointment date in the GroupMe. Nick, and I believe Jordan, have already announced their intention to receive the vaccine. That leaves John, Jboss, and Emyr. 
By my count, Kristen owns two condos. I think she is the true real estate mogul
By New Year's 2023
By no fault of Emyr's goody just gifted him the perfect keeper team instead of fairly diving up keepers between Emyr and Jordan, which actually happened under Commissioner Darrow's watch. 
By promoted, you mean that you quit and got a real job? 
By rule, it should have resulted in a do over which robbed of a touchdown. But they gave us the ball at the spot of the reception and called a 15 yard penalty on Rex Ryan for walking in front of the official while the play was still going 
By sending him a letter, apparently. Not even in person? 
By settled his debt, you mean that you released coronavirus into his new apartment and watched him die a painful death, then took all his assets?
By subjecting small children to substandard medical care provided by incompetent medical students 
By the time you walked 1000 miles to my door, I will have moved 13,894 miles away 
By the way, are you calling me Joff because of GoT? I just kind of realized that's what the reference was to 
By the way, before I blow my lead tonight, we should talk about how two of my players put up a combined 61 points on Thursday (blow my lead looks an awful lot like blow my load)
By the way, Darrow was 30 minutes away 45 minutes ago. Odds he shows up? 
By the way, did we auto draft in our ESPN fantasy basketball league this year? Like did it auto reset?
By the way, for those keeping track, I only sat in the bar by myself for 24 minutes, not 30 minutes 
By the way, fuck Goody for voting for Trump. What a fucking moron 
By the way, Marcus Bauer, who was just recently urinating next to a supreme court nominee, believes himself to be in the same financial situation as me. The only person who urinates next to me is the homeless man who lives outside of the medical school and drinks steel reserve all day
By the way, my dad's coworker at the garden is the one who orders the beer. The garden charges a 7000% markup on a cup of beer 
By the way, what's everyone's opinion of ppr next year, but touchdowns only count as 4 points?
By the way, you are all getting rekt in our NFL pickem
By utilitarian principle, Saturday would be the most fair day

Cam should really try and approach the game like Thomas Brady. I've never seen him calling for flags to be thrown or yelling at the ref or engaging in a year long court battle. 
Cam was given that laptop as a gift and I've never claimed otherwise
Cam wouldn't have thrown that

Careful Goody, he's judging your recommendation. Don't want to give him any reason to give you a bad review 
Careful guys. Bocker went to a Beyonce concert. He might be upset at the negative things you're saying 
Careful or you’ll get preempted 
Careful what you say Bocker. You are expected to unconditionally support your team and never criticize them ever, even if they continue to make the same mistakes year after year and never get any better and continue to lose to every big name team while only being able to beat cupcakes
Careful with meeting up in January in DC

Newport Vineyards is a fun spot. The chef there has been recognized pretty widely. 

The Newport Hospital has my favorite ED in the whole state.

Chan, actually we didn't let talib go. His contract was up and the Broncos overpaid for him with the idea that Peyton can't feel his fingers and has a noodle arm and they needed to spend all their cash to "win now"
Chan, as the only two GroupMe members who care about football, I'm glad I am experiencing this with you 
Chan, at first I was upset that you had any shred of happiness after last season. But my attitude has changed and I'm glad that you had the opportunity to experience a truly magical post season run to end one of the best qb of all time's career. I'm glad you're able to experience that happiness again, just a few hours before dealing with a dozen pats fans watching their team win a fifth super bowl

Chan, I am happy for you at all, but you do realize that the Broncos won DESPITE Peyton manning, not because of him, right? 
Chan, I am sorry for not believing you. Best of luck with everything. You always have a couch to sleep on when you come back to Boston. I wish you told me so I could have bought you Sprite
Chan, I appreciate you contributing to my knowledge about this subject.
Chan, I disagree. Her voice was like a mixture of fergie and Jesus. 
Chan, I don't ask for much. But I'd appreciate if CJ Anderson would let Booker get 15 points next week too. 
Chan, I heard that the Rams training staff already cleared him to return to practice
Chan, I just want you to know, regardless who wins or loses, I will still buy you sprite. You're a fantastic competitor 
Chan, I know you sometimes like to skim but you must have missed when Marcus declared, via text, that BC was a 10 win team. Our fate has already been decided, please keep up.
Chan, I know you're already upset that you lost the upcoming Super Bowl, but you have to stop grasping for straws with you're trolling. Quite frankly, it's embarrassing. But if you need a shoulder to cry one, don't fucking come here because we have no sympathy

Chan, I will change my stance. Don't push me 
Chan, if you ever stopped giving me shit for everything I do in life, I would be sad. I feel like it is what our friendship is built on

Chan, I'm officially all about Brock. If only he took over the offense last month so it could have been Brocktober
Chan, Joe, Goody, Darrow, Jordan, Jeff. Anyone else? I know Kovin is busy, John is away, Bocker is in NY. Marcus won't read the groupme for a week. Nick is in RI. @Skimmer? @Jamie Bourque ?

Chan's jokes are relevant and hilarious. I think we all appreciate the good laugh we get from his classics.

Combine that with Capital One Shopping 10% cash back
Combine that with the fact that you didn't wake me up for game day last Sunday 
Combing two different running jokes from the groupme. I like it. 
Comcast 
Comcast still doesn't include ESPN in their basic cable package #chan
Comcast told me it would be fixed at 710. It is now 715. It's not fixed. I call again, they tell me to check back in 24 hours 
Come anytime after 530. I will be making buffalo chicken dip and probably some other stuff. Bring whatever you want to snack on and any beverages you want to consume but don't feel like you have to. Parking is free on the street on weekends and there are normally a good amount of spots around
Come back home 
Come back to me bby
Come back to me Goody. I’m trying to circle jerk basketball and you are just taking a pass 
Come back to us bby
come from lower SES backgrounds**
Come on guys, this last one is head and shoulders above the other players at his position 
COME ON JOE BACK ME UP HERE 
Come on man, I already whipped it out 
Come on PC Principal. Channel that anger. 
COME ON REF OPEN YOUR EYES 
Come or don't come, either way, fuck you. 
Come play pogo
Come study pulm with me?
Come to Cranston 
Come to hang out. Spend whole time looking at past GroupMe posts 
Come to Maine. We have tubing here 
Come to Somerville. You'll be in for a shock 
Come to think of it, never seen Zuber and Zappe in the same room together 
Come up with a better question 
Comeback started 
Comeback story
Comey found out he was fired from a tv report while he was giving a speech to the LA FBI branch 
Coming
Coming
Coming back against goody. Count on it. 
Coming back to Boston for dinner on Saturday/full time job?
Coming for Sackler, as in you’re going to push Oxy into millions of people and play a huge role in causing the opioid epidemic? 
Coming for the number one spot bby
Coming from Ryan, I find that 50% more funny 
Coming from the person who was pissed that you shit in her toilet tracks
Coming out of a burial with zero GroupMe messages. No one wanted to squad up with me. Things are looking dark for ya boi joff 
coming*
Commanders 3rd longest with 18 years 
Commanders caved big time 
Comment on the part that I read*
Comment*
Comments like that paper ticket one are what gave Jordan’s team the motivation it needed to win 
Comments on others' "pussy feelings." Leaves the groupme because of a comment about a mass shooting at a gay club. 
Commercial 
Commercials* not time outs 
Commie uniforms suck
Commish, I vote that Marcus loses two points form lions D. That interception was a result of a missed defensive holding. Make it happen 
Commission of domestic violence while in the commission of a burglary
Commissioner Darrow is the definition of unbiased 
Commissioner Goody supports #TeamJoff 
Communal underwear 🐐
Communist. 
Commuting*
Comparable
Comparable to that broncos WR a few years back 
Comparatively, Brady and Gronk have connected on 3 of 6 attempted goal line fades. Small sample size, but one play call is a true 50/50 jump ball while the other one is clearly more successful 
Comparing Mahoney to Favre is just disgusting 
Compelling argument 
Complain about losing in fantasy 
Complaining about likes isn't going to get you anywhere 
Complete double standard. You can post NSFW pics during work if you warn first, but can’t post a dude who’s foot fell off with a warning 
Completed it? No. I saved Hyrule, but I still have at least 7 months of gameplayeft 
Completely different park in a different country but the parking lots at Banff were full by like 7 am 
Completely fine. I'll just pop them in when you're done or when there is space. 
Completely for them 
Completely made up 
Completely normal Wednesday. Nothing special about this particular Wednesday compared to the other fifty one Wednesdays. 
Completely selfish suggestion: TITS in Porter square has trivia Mondays and Wednesdays, the food is delicious, and the hosts are always pretty cool 
Completely the point of his character. Done very well 
Completely true. Especially with the lag in test turnaround time, case counts are still several days behind. Plus as Bocker has been pointing out, you only get tested if you're moderately symptomatic so you are essentially losing 25-50% of your true cases based on how widely you screen.
Completely unlike using "we" when referring to the Patriots. As diehard fans, we contribute immensely to the team's success in OUR league

Connor is from Wakefield and is JBoss's age 
Connor Orr is on the next pod 👀
Conor has no business being famous anymore. He sucks at fighting and at not breaking his leg
Conor lamb won reelection in the combined district. That's pretty cool 
Consider it ignored
Consider me back out of your life. 
Consider me out
Considering goody started the game off by saying this will be a game where we see who makes the least mistakes 
Considering he said before and after the super bowl that he was coming back, but he just hasn't said it in the last month
Considering how he's managed the secret Moses this year, do you really want him managing a whole athletic program? 
Considering I’m on vacation, I did take the day off 
Considering most of those players aren't starters and have more missed calls with less playing time, it seems that Cam Newton is protected pretty fairly 
Considering Olivia and I paid for the live stream instead because we couldn't get tickets 
Considering Shrinkng as well 
Considering that's the abbreviation of the Seattle Seahawks
Considering we have >4 people if Joe is still coming

Conspiracy theory: Anne Frank never existed. The German government wrote “her” diary and published it and now makes money on every copy that gets sold 
Conspiracy Theory: Morcus has a fleshlight. Shelbie found it and didn't know what it was and Morcus convinced her that it was a European flashlight. Now he is trying to hide that from his lovely wife.
Conspiracy theory: the #FakeNewsMedia staged the coup attempt to increase cable news ratings. Change my mind.

Could also be an inguinal hernia
Could be a lot of things. You aren't telling me anything that makes me think you're in grave danger. My rules for seeing a doctor immediately for abdominal pain include persistent fevers, pain that is persistent moderate to severe and doesn't get better with Tylenol, vomiting that prevents you from tolerating fluids, persistent rectal bleeding, among other things
Could Biden be more absent during this pandemic? I haven't heard a peep from him since that last debate with no audience
Could happen to the best of us. Or the worst of us like me
Could have at least made a joke about how you hate him and we're going to avoid seeing him 
Could have been your throne 
Could have built in extra bye weeks too for added flexibility
Could have done this anonymously but nope, needed the world to know that he donated on GoFundMe 
Could have easily stopped that 
Could have ended the series in like 2 scenes
Could have just said "when I send stuff"
Could have just woken up earlier to ensure you had adequate shitting time 
Could have used duct tape
Could not have put that ball any better 
Could use some better play in coverage from our linebackers and secondary but pressure up front gives us something to build on, especially with Gonzo coming back 
Could we fit in some time for a reading seminar? 
Could you guys imagine if Jordan drone struck one of us 
Could you guys possibly imagine not being done with clan games? 
Could you imagine
Could you imagine how good we would be if traded for Dobbs instead of letting him go to the poopy Vikings
Could you imagine living in Manhattan anyway? I'd probably shit on the floor of the A train and then off myself by fighting a horse in central park within a week
Could you imagine? 
Could you not depress the shit out of us? 
Could you please inform Faiz that I never received a save the date. Kthnx
Could you remind me about it again?
Coulda been here

Counterpoint, get Marcus in more trouble by telling Kristen to use them
Counterpoint, he has a history of doing dumb shit and doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt 
Counterpoint, maybe now they are used to a dude not named bocker and will come out of their shells for me. 
Counterpoint. All American money is blood money because of how we murdered and pillaged native American lands to build our empire
Counterpoint. Fantasy football ownership shows superiority over those two countries 
Counterpoint. Maybe if there were actual consequences, the administration would be less accepting of its teams chronically underperforming 
Counterpoint. They pick the controversial winner so people will actually talk about their magazine for the requisite one time a year that they are mentioned 
Counterpoint: he never did

If not, do I separate my role into research vs. non-research and split it up between both sections?

Dak Prescott now
Dallas has the best o line, supposedly, and best running game last year, and we held their rushing yards down and put tons of pressure on weeden all day 
Dallas is not taking a QB. Giants probably don't take a QB. Philly might take one? Chargers don't. Vikings don't.
Dallas scored to quickly 
Dallas sure looks like the super team that everyone thought they were...
Dallas? More like DaLOLas. Or DalLOSE
Dallas? More like DLOLas

Defense and offense good
Defense can carry teams to the Super Bowl. Pitt doesn't have a great defense, Denver does. Plus home field. Would prefer Pitt 
Defense doesn't exist in college football
Defense good. Offense bad. Special teams baaaaaad
Defense lost this one. Way too many big plays
Defense sus
Defense wins championships.

Definitely will vaccinate again when they know more. They'll look at each individual patient and see if there are other risk factors for the clots. This is the type of thing where they will end up saying, "the patient has no other risk factors so it is likely that the vaccine contributed" or they will highlight the other possible factors that could have caused it

Dems trifecta for the next 3 decades confirmed 
Dems wanted a vote on DACA before approving the CR to fund the government. Trump wanted money for a wall and immigration stuff, etc. Couldn't agree, so CR wasn't passed and government shut down. Dems blasted McConnell and Trump for refusing to vote on DACA despite the senate supposedly having enough votes to pass a DACA agreement. Schumer was basically given McConnell/Trump's word that sometime in the future, they'll vote on DACA and people are pissed that the Dems caved to let the government open back up without actually getting more than a promise, which may end up meaning nothing

Denver had a 20 play drive at the end of the first half and converted twice on fourth down, but couldn't convert on 4th and 2 in the red zone. So they are still down 10-3
Denver is so thirsty for Rodgers

Denver offense has done next to nothing. They've been helped by the defense (touchdown and three turnovers) and a big run back from a punt

Dependable? I don't know what adjective was used. Fuck you. 
Depending on your choice of location 
Depends how long the extension is for 
Depends how much you buy from amazon 
Depends how much you pay me
Depends how you feel about being up to $400k in debt without a way to pay it back
Depends if you go for the just-fucked-a-bag-of-flour variety. Rare, but can really fuck up your day 
Depends if you spit or swallow
Depends if you think he’s ready to play or not 
Depends if you want Caleb or not
Depends if you want cash rewards or points/miles rewards 
Depends if you're planning to leave to get your MBA next year or not 
Depends on if they are 400m hurdles or 110m hurdles 
Depends on the clinic. Some places, like BCH has people who do all of this. But in a small primary care office, they likely don't staff someone to help with those processes as thoroughly
Depends on the day 
Depends on the personal foul 
Depends on the state
Depends on the state. NY is age 21
Depends what my situation is next year. I don't see what the big deal about carrying an extra player is? I moved dion Lewis to the ir spot and had an open roster spot. If I need it later, I'll drop him

Didn't exist when I played
Didn't expect to see a murder so early in the late afternoon
Didn't get the discount 
Didn't he retire to be a clergyman and then get arrested on gun charges?
Didn't he try and patent "Money Bags" 
Didn't hear that part 
Didn't Jordan ask this about 12 times? 
Didn't Jordan just run two miles in like 18 minutes or something?
Didn't Jordan say that Hilary was going to blow out trump like an hour ago?
Didn't know Bogaerts switched to a fake sports

Didn't look like a Joe Bourque slice to me. Looked like it was going straight for the window of a backhoe

Didn't the Rams realize that the redskins fucked themselves by leveraging the long term success of their team by trading all of their draft picks? You'd think that the Rams would think about that before doing this

Disappointed that partisanship has led us down this road where we are not removing protections that the minority party had and essentially eliminating an effective system of checks and balances, at least as it pertains to SCOTUS nominees 
Disappointed. Congress should be protecting me, not multi-billion dollar businesses who purposely sabotaged the economy to make a quick buck 
Disappointing that Jordan, a fake ners fan, did not care enough to stay for the full game

Disney appropriates Asian culture. #ChangeMyMind
Disney Cruise adults might be the worst population in existence
Disney is absolutely trash. The entire place is just a money suck. You pay like $150 a day just to get into the park, and then each meal is like $40 a person. The lines are abysmally long during any time of the year you'd actually have the time to go. The rides aren't that fun. 75% of every park is gift shops.

DJ Big Tiny made a lot of right career moves
DJ Chanimal is honorary guest and headlining DJ at my "not invited to the wedding" party 
DJax to the Eagles
DK can play RT
DK, Godwin, Tee would have at least been upgrades to our #2/#3 receiver positions, even if none of them are true #1s. I am not convinced that an old Diggs coming off of a knee injury when he was already on the decline is going to be much of an upgrade 
DLine is arguably the best position group on BC football. DLine coach is leaving. 
Dline shifts and draws a false start. The pats do that all the time and it works so fucking well. Exactly what Tomlin bitched about in last year's season opener.

Do it 
Do it anyway, Goody. Ignore the people who don't give a fuck

Do the move sets differ between teams? I didn't read anything when I chose my team- just chose blue because Darrow told me to 
Do the right thing, Bocker. Release the texts.

Do we even know if he made it out of the Caesar's loading dock?

Doesn't like bigets cleaning his ass. Doesn't like tongues cleaning his ass. 
Doesn't listen to the announcers. Doesn't just the performance based on sound quality or actually singing and is just happy listening to an mp3 of all of Rihanna's songs spliced together. 
Doesn't look like it
Doesn't look like roughing the kicker to me 
Doesn't make sense to run that play when Clemson is clearly not trying to block the kick and is in a defensive look
Doesn't matter goody, you lost to your rival 
Doesn't matter if he's targeted if he can't get open and make catches 
Doesn't matter if you can't stand upright to throw
Doesn't matter if you kick the shit out of poor Kevin 
Doesn't matter what evidence you have, you're still wrong 
Doesn't matter what happened in any other groupme. This is the only groupme that matters
Doesn't matter, free coffee
Doesn't mean I can't hope season 5 will be great 
Doesn't mean I have to care about anything Bocker says 
Doesn't preworkout protein have caffeine added for that purpose?
Doesn't really fit with the "pay everyone everything" solution
Doesn't seem as unreasonable in this situation 
Doesn't seem replaceable now. Don't see you selling khakis 
Doesn't specify but I assume no 
Doesn't stand up to Left Shark 
Doesn't stop be from ingesting sustenance through my oral cavity 
Doesn't the fact that it backfired make it a bad call? Now instead of three, you're giving them a chance at seven
Doesn't want to lose the 1,000 rushing yard title 
Doesn't work that way

don’t do the voice 
Don’t do this to me on Christmas....
Don’t forget a first round left tackle and a right tackle who false starts every play
Don’t forget that his brother was interviewing him like every night on CNN and he always wore that bomber jacket. He came off as a star. 
Don’t fucking disrespect Bocker like that. He’s a wonderful person 
Don’t get me started on whether Tweets should count as posts 
Don’t hate me when he scores 23 touchdowns this year 
Don’t insult Marcus like that 
Don’t know enough to comment 
Don’t know how buffalo ends up losing yards on that 
Don’t know how I could be happy as a Bills fan with that game knowing Cook’s usage
Don’t know what I was expecting

Don’t know what’s worse. That or
Don’t leave before Kloee sells for $20 billion, John! 
Don’t let goody decide to eat at the restaurant closest to him. Darrow, make him go all the way to the one closest to your parking spot 
Don’t let that distract you from the fact that the patriots didn’t blow a 23 point lead -Reddit 
"Don’t let the suckiness of the Phantom Menace distract you from
Joe being in the Posa "
Don’t let this argument distract you from the fact that Goody muted the Groupme, AGAIN, on a game day Sunday with fantasy playoffs
Don’t let tiger distract you from the fact that Bocker skimmed Goody’s post about the new “EA UFC” game

Don’t talk about John’s husband that way! 
Don’t talk about mama Goodwin that way. She’s a saint 
Don’t want to miss anything 
Don’t want to take them away, just want people to be smart with them 
Don’t watch videos in the GroupMe though
Don’t worry Bocker, I won’t be there 
Don’t worry bocks. I saw the news on Carr last night. I didn’t see JBoss on the Tobin while I was up there last night
Don’t worry friend. Since collusion apparently isn’t illegal in this league, I’ll bench my whole team so you’re sure to win 
Don’t worry, I found it myself. Thanks for nothing Marcus 
Don’t worry, I’m ignoring that because it is #NotMyNarrative
Don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll answer you within a reasonable amount of time

Don't be one of the five people to die climbing to the top in the last month 
Don't be so confident in your old team, JBoss. The lineup lost to me twice.

Don't believe him, @Channe Frank. He's going to try and get you thrown in an internment camp 
Don't believe you
Don't believe you Ryan 
Don't blame bocker for not knowing the difference. He only drinks waters 
Don't blame me. I'm glutarded. That pizza wasn't for me 
Don't blame Shelbie. She is infallible. 
Don't blame this on COVID. COVID is just misunderstood

DONT EVER DISRESPECT MY RUNNING BACK AGAIN 
Don't fall for it, @Ass Ketchum . I came down to DC and messaged the GroupMe, tagging Morcus at least a dozen times and he still has not recognized that he stood me up
Don't flatter yourself. No one in this groupme wants to see your dick. 
Don't forget about domestic terrorists, although the last two categories kind of blend in with that 
Don't forget Bocker going another day without fulfilling his duty to the GroupMe 
Don't forget Brianna Fitz. She cooked for me and then came down with the celiac

Don't get the splint wet*
Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'm walking in in a minute 
Don't give goody that option 
Don't give him any attention. He's literally dead to me
Don't give in to the lies John!
Don't give me that. You're the one who left me for New York you ungrateful piece of shit 
Don't give them anything. If they question you, get really defensive and blame them for losing your gift
Don't go against the union 
Don't go to your boss. Go to us. 
Don't hate me because i have an actual work ethic, while others in this groupme seem to be allergic to hard work (Kovin, Bocker, Omyr, Nock)
Don't have 4th year schedule. I think that's the last week of my first block. If I am doing an away, I will be moving back home that weekend but will know further down the road. Not a hard no.
Don't have a job = a poor 
Don't have either 
Don't hold your breath. He never showed up to hang out with me 
Don't impersonate a Syrian refugee 
Don't insult a man's livelihood, Bocker. 
Don't interrupt me. I'm busy 
DONT JINX ME 
Don't know 
Don't know him? That all sounds exactly like what Joe would do 
Don't know how accurate that actually is 
Don't know how anyone in the Pats organization watches this game after what happened earlier today and thinks that keeping Mayo is the right answer 
Don't know how he didn't go down but fucking phenomenal pressure 
Don't know how I autocorrected to gif 
Don't know how I could have since she posts every other day
Don't know how I didn't get that right away 
Don't know how I made that typo 
Don't know how that wasn't blocked
Don't know how the DB doesn't make a better play on that floater
Don't know how you call a pass in that situation 
Don't know how you could be a bills fan after reading this
Don't know how you don't call a time out there. Still, this is a lot of time 
Don't know how you fuck that up.
Don't know how you have the Super Bowl on a field like this 
Don't know how you trust your defense down two of it's best players over your offense gaining a yard 
Don't know if I agree with that result 
Don't know if I'm proud that he didn't skim or sad that it took him 2 days to recognize this achievement
Don't know if overreaction because media is media or if this is just the new expectation 
Don't know if the two things were related 
Don't know if this is old news but Eddie lacy took himself out of the game because he was having an asthma attack 
Don't know the other two 
Don't know what that is
Don't know what was worse. The kick return or the camera angle 
Don't know what you're talking about, Joe is the foremost thinker in this Groupme regarding BC football issues
Don't know what you're talking about. My bitmoji is clearly eating a sandwich
Don't know what you're talking about. We've won the Super Bowl twice in the last 3 years. Don't remember any missed kicks, nope
Don't know what's going on there
Don't know where that emoji came from
Don't know who Joe Danneman is but maybe he knows something
Don't know who Sandoval is?
Don't know who that is but that is horrible 
Don't know who the fuck Austin is but okay 
Don't know why anyone would think anyone other than Seth Moulton was the right choice for this country 
Don't know why I said infinite. Most recent one I've played I guess 
Don't know why it didn't quote it like I asked it to
Don't know why Joe would do that to you 
Don't know why that doesn't get as much love as Die Hard in terms of Christmas Movies
Don't know why that rule exists in 2020 but I am sure Morcus will write a long-form about it
Don't know why that tag got fucked up like that. @The Big Dick Bandit 
Don't know why they called the time out too early 
Don't leave BoChangles Nix (From a Middle Class Family) off of your list

Don't let it happen again. Study the manual.

Don't let kovin skimming and bocker getting trade raped distract you from goody posting last week's waiver wire report thinking it was today's
Don't let me be the LAST to wish @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD and @LIV Strong a happy and bike-free birthday 
Don't let me win three in a row next week Jamie

Don't listen to the haters chan 
Don't live on the west coast

Don't look now Darrow, but I'm coming for you
Don't look now, but Cooks has a catch 🐸
Don't look now, but Ebron has a catch 🐸
Don't look now, but sterling shepard has two catches 🐸
Don't lump us all together. Some of us understand 
Don't make it so obvious next time
Don't make me send the triggered video again 
Don't make Morcus buy in
Don't make trades bro 
Don't mind Becker, Ryan. He doesn't have "blacks" in Long Island. You'll have to excuse his racial stereotypes 
Don't need credit to own a debit card. IDIOT.
Don't need Joe to puke a second time
Don't need someone alive for WW2 making policy decisions that affect my life
Don't order without me. I'll be there any minute 
Don't pay her and still don't worry about it
Don't pin this on me. Maybe you should look internally to figure out why Emyr doesn't respect you as a human
Don't pin this on us performing well 
Don't put it all on Aaron Jones. I had several members of my team underperform
Don't put that hypothetical on me 
Don't put your face there if you don't want to get hit
Don't remind me 
Don't reward skimming. Reward shitting on skimming
Don't ruin my moment joe

Don't say this too loud. @AbadBot might hear you 
Don't see Adam Sandler making an NFL PS roster...
Don't show Angela 
Don't show us all up 
Don't spoil it. It's been lovely.
Don't stick your face next to someone's elbow
Don't take it personally Jamie. Joe didn't invite me to play march madness with him junior year and we lived in the same suite. He's just a dick 
Don't take it personally Jordances With Wolves. You have helped me solidify a lot of my political believes and have pushed me towards the right on a lot of issues. Most importantly, you have helped me become informed, which is all you could ever really ask for amirite?
Don't take that title from me 
Don't talk about Jameson like that
DONT TALK ABOUT MY FRIEND ANTHONY LIKE THAT 
Don't talk about my Pokemon like that
Don't talk about my starting quarterback like that!

Don't tell The Athletic Football Show
Don't tell the Cabal 
Don't tell the progressive left wokies that I used a Dave Chappelle gif 
Don't tell them what to do. 
Don't they know that most fans are over 30 years old and should be asleep by now
Don't they pay for you to have first class in JetBlue?
Don't they teach you this stuff (along with all cocomelon songs) in pediatrics school
Don't think he actually went to college 
Don't think I haven't looked at that but I would need to switch multiple shifts, which just doesn't work in June 
Don't think I won't do that 
Don't think I would have attended if there wasn't a way to watch the game
Don't think I would have gotten green
Don't think that will sell you, but something to consider
Don't think you're a catch 
Don't touch that hot take, you might get burned. 
Don't try and dodge the issue Goody. Thanks for not believing in me. 
Don't try and point out things I did in order to drive my roommate kovin and me apart 
Don't try and take control of my body, john. My body my right. 
Don't try and tell me how I identify.
Don't try to deflect blame. If you had just made bots for all of us, I wouldn't have had to try to make one 
Don't try to shame me for trying to connect with my good friend @Skimmer 
Don't use finals as an excuse 
Don't want the devil's drink to turn you into the person you claim not to be even though you clearly Google all your sports grid answers
Don't want to know what that is 
Don't want you to think that we cared about you 
Don't watch past season 3
Don't what? 
Don't wish that evil on him, Ricky Bobby 
Don't worry about gluten restriction. I can find a gf alternative or work around it
Don't worry about me. I am not drinking tonight
Don't worry about us, we are just grabbing lunch now and then probably heading home. We will be back in plenty of time 
Don't worry bby, I drive home tomorrow 
Don't worry BDB, I got you 
Don't worry Becker, I was the underdog last week too. You can do it 
Don't worry Becker, maybe next week we'll have saved up enough to buy groceries 
Don't worry Bock, Lamar vultured your TD, not Collins
Don't worry chan, Becker went on a rant about how he hates when people post pictures of themselves at a wedding without any of the bride and groom. I had just posted the exact picture he was describing about an hour earlier 
Don't worry Darrow, he'll probably fumble and then break his hand and not play the rest of the game 
Don't worry Darrow, we have the jags vs the Titans next Thursday night. 
Don't worry Darrow. Once the rest of Joe's team severely underperforms, you'll still beat him with the 78 points you put up this week 
Don't worry Fuckholes. Made it to Texas safely. I know you were all waiting anxiously 
Don't worry goody, sal palentonio is reporting that NFL security officials are very concerned that the cold weather will cause the footballs to drop below 12.5 psi in the Vikings/Seahawks game today. So I think that means we're getting our picks back. Right?!
Don't worry goody. We won't let the foreigners dictate our jerking regimen. We will e-jerk whenever we please. 
Don't worry guys, Carson's fumble turns into a Vance McDonald TD, so net +4 on that
Don't worry guys, I'm getting an mph to improve the way we handle end of life care. I got this shit. 
Don't worry guys, they're keeping Loseston next year 
Don't worry he slid forward head first 
Don't worry John, hurns is practicing today 
Don't worry Jordan, two of his three wins came against me. So essentially he only got 1 win against a real team (provided that it wasn't against John)
Don't worry Kevin, we can do our own fuckholes thanksgiving on the 14th 
Don't worry man, don't ask don't tell has been rescinded
Don't worry though. I was at a wedding today and was talking with a friend's husband. He's a position coach on a D3 football team. He said that all BC needs to do is pipe in some NIL funding and hire the HC head coach and then we will be golden 
Don't worry, @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson. Your belief in climate change put you out of the running from the getgo 
Don't worry, @Chandrew Becker , I know you posted about Kaep before Jamie did.
Don't worry, Adams is back 
Don't worry, been pounding back them waters
Don't worry, Chan already said he'd pay for it 
Don't worry, Darrow has generously bestowed it with a like.
Don't worry, he already put a hole in the shower while moving his new recliner in the house 
Don't worry, he's going to make the end result really really good for states 
Don't worry, I can wait 
Don't worry, I haven't listened to any of your IG songs
Don't worry, I only have dirt folders on Bocker, Morcus, and Joe. I tried to keep one for Goody but it filled up my hard drive
Don't worry, I removed my like 
Don't worry, I root for my NFL team to win. 
Don't worry, I was wrong about eliminating penalties 
Don't worry, I won't
Don't worry, I'll be living my best life today 
Don't worry, I'm sure Goody will be applying to grad school any day now
Don't worry, I'm sure Hopkins has a lot of yards this game
Don't worry, it gets easier when it happens four years in a row 
Don't worry, it's ok. You're going to change the world. 
Don't worry, Kai's Kai is trying out for us today 
Don't worry, one headline already wrote that letting Brady leave was the equivalent of trading away Babe Ruth
Don't worry, Russ is going to throw a pick 6 on the 3rd play of this upcoming drive
Don't worry, she's not home 
Don't worry, the invite is valid for tonight's nightshift too 
Don't worry, they will trade back to the 5th round
Don't worry, they're bringing him back next year 
Don't worry. I ain't mad 
Don't worry. I am sure Mahomes will throw seven pick sixes 
Don't you dare accommodate me, you son of a bitch. 
Don't you dare fucking jinx me 
DON'T YOU DARE REMOVE FLOWERS
Don't you dare say that about the grittiest player in the NBA 
Don't you dare speak I'll of @JustFacts✅. He almost died changing his pants 30 minutes ago 
Don't you fucking jinx me
Don't you go ruining this for us 
Don't you go spinning this compliment, Mr. Tony
Don't you have a flight to miss or something
Don't you mean as of 6/30?
Don't you mean...................Hammsome
Don't you remember? Bocker said that you can't get a steak to taste anywhere near as good as if it were at a surprise if you cook it yourself
Dooms*
Doritos used to state that they were gluten free but they no longer state that and there is concern that they aren’t safe 
Dorsett already hurt and our Oline cannot run block 
Dorsett doesn't turn his head and Meyers can't catch
Dorsett. WR1 threat 
DOs are fine. 
DOs are real doctors. I have also worked with many amazing IMGs
Double bonus not looking very favorable right now 
Double entendre intended
Double gulag for people who don't have their passport out despite her asking twice before boarding started 
Double lol
Double 🙄
Double, RBI single, error on a bunt down the first base line. 2 on, no out right now. Stephens hasn't looked great 
Doubling down on their mistake. Those refs can join the Fuckholes any day of the week 
Doubling down on your horrendous take. Gutta respect it. 
Doubt it. I'm pretty good at scouting 
Doubt it. You couldn't take more than 7 at once 
Douchey hot take: warriors will lose every game the rest of the season
Doug flutie 
"Doug Flutie
It is with a heavy heart that I am making this statement. This morning my family experienced the tragic loss of my father, Dick and mother, Joan. My Dad had been ill and died of a heart attack in the hospital and my Mom, less than an hour later had a sudden heart attack and passed away. They say you can die of a broken heart and I believe it. I would like to honor my parents for all that they did throughout my and my brothers’ and sister’s lives. My parents were always there for their children, from the days my Dad coached us as kids and my Mom would work the concession stands, through to this morning. The most important part of their 56 years of marriage was providing opportunities to their children. They were incredible parents and Grandparents and my family and I will miss them both. On behalf of me and the entire Flutie family, I would like to thank you all for your well wishes and prayers during this difficult time.

Emyr is a kind and competent leader. Your smear campaign is unfounded and deplorable. 
Emyr is coming to Boda Borg 
Emyr is right and I think that there are a few reasons behind it. The most obvious reason, as goody mentions, is that we have been there so often. It's not like we have a track record of not making the playoffs or losing early. Secondly, we start every year at this point in Brady's career wondering how effective he will be, and whether he'll get knocked out of the game for good/decide to retire, etc. When he's playing at this high of a level, it feels like a waste to not have the parts put together in other places to make a super bowl run. I feel like we had a championship caliber defense and qb, but the other areas where we were lacking ruined our chances. And who knows how Brady will play next year
Emyr is so in passionate about nomar that he waited until the debate was closed to give his opinion. That hardly counts for anything 
Emyr is truly a sensible, smart, handsome, kind individual
Emyr is v good at this game
Emyr isn't here anymore. We don't need to talk basketball 
Emyr leaves after goody’s and my jokes about a football player who was injured while knowingly putting his body at risk; doesn’t leave the groupme when Goody jokes about dozens of gay club-goers being mowed down by an assault rifle

Emyr, when you're a Supreme Court justice, are you going to be liberal or are you going to deny gay people their rights and force rape babies to be born into poverty and drug homes? 
Emyr, why won't you talk to us 
Emyr, you're a wonderful person and you will always be my friend, which makes this really hard for me to say. We did discuss them in the groupme and I think....that maybe....you might....have skimmed them..... I'm sorry, that hurt me to say more than it hurt you

"Extended quote via Mike Kadlick: 

“Defensively, the #Patriots led the league last year in rushing defense. Yards per carry: No. 1 in the league, and this year they’re way down in the 20s somewhere. 

...It’s the same guys. They re-signed [Anfernee] Jennings, they re-signed [Jahlani] Tavai, they re-signed [Kyle] Dugger. Marcus Jones and [Christian] Gonzalez have been healthy... You got [Deatrich] Wise, you got [Davon] Godchaux, you got Keion White, you got [Marte] Mapu. It’s a lot the same players... 

I’m kind of hurt for those guys. Because to call them soft, they’re not soft. They were the best team in the league last year against the run... I feel bad for the defensive players on that one because those guys, that’s a tough group.”"

Fadule played most of the game, then Jeff smith came in and didn't play great. But he did pull off an 80 yard run on a read option. Then they put fadule back in, he drove the ball and then took a shot to the head when he took off to try and get the first down. So they took him out in the middle of the drive to check him for a concussion and put smith back in who had a couple of good throws, including a td

Fair enough. I feel like they could have won if they made better decisions in certain situations (coverage, how they formed the o line, lack of o line adjustments, Brady's bad interceptions, etc).

Fellow disciples of the Lord Belichick. The time is almost upon us. The Lord has brought us an abundance opportunities, but none more important than what He hath bring us today. Today, we have the opportunity, ney, the obligation to put to rest the demon spawn of the West. If the teachings of the Lord have taught us anything, it is this: we must seize every opportunity as it presents itself, as it may not exist tomorrow. That is why today, we will rise above the hate spewed by the demon's minions, we will rise above adversity, and once and for all, we will earn the right to fight to be the true champions. Let this be a day our children, and our children's children treasure! Let us honor Teddy, Ty, Rodney, Troy, Mike, and all those before us. Let. Us. Rise!

Secondly, all available sites are listed on one Mass Vax site, but basically every distribution center has its own website, and the Mass Vax site is not updated regularly enough when slots are open or filled. So you have to go to like 10 different websites to see if there is an opening. Thirdly, when you select a time slot on any of these websites, it doesn't hold the spot. Like with Ticketmaster, you have 5 minutes to check out before you forfeit the seats you chose. This isn't that. Every spot is fair game so by the time you enter all your information (about 10 pages), the site has either crashed or someone has already claimed your desired spot and you have to start over.

For the purpose of this discussion, let's just go with yes 
For the record, even if POTS is real, it’s not diagnosed in the ED 
For the record, I do go to the gym and I climb very high. I also cannot eat mcdonalds but do not follow a vitamin-only diet. That seems difficult.
For the record, I support bipartisan improvement to Obamacare that lowers cost, reduces government spending, increases coverage, and stabilizes individual markets. That shouldn't be too hard to do. 
For the record, I supported my good friend Luigi by buying stuff from both whole foods and Amazon. And I used my ring camera to see the Amazon package get delivered
"For the record, I will reiterate that I also don't appreciate lewd material during the workday. I work in a shared space and a gif of some big ol'titties bouncing across my screen wouldn't go over well. However I choose not to open the groupme at times when such pictures are being shared.

For those not watching, Lelisa did not win. It was the closest finish in Men's Boston Marathon History
For those not watching, Miami had bases loaded and one out. Batter hits grounder to first, who throws it to second to try and start a double play. Shortstop relays back to first but doesn't get the second out, so run scores. But ump rules that the runner sliding into second didn't take a direct path to the base, so is slide is illegal and a second out is assessed. Inning ends without a run scoring. 
For those of you heavily considering moving in with me, found a fantastic apartment in Southie. $3000 split three ways. 6/1 move in. Can send pictures. Slide into my DMs if interested 
For those of you playing fantasy baseball, half of the Red Sox team, coaches, and even the play by play guy have all either come down with influenza or the stomach bug or both. Start with caution. 
For those of you unfamiliar with what a pee level is, 0 is basically completely dry, trousers and underpants unsoiled. 10 is basically underpants: soaked through, trousers, soaked through, and basically you need a full change of clothes and a shower
"For those planning on coming today (read: just Darrow), the menu is:

- chips and homemade salsa verde
- buffalo chicken dip
- sweet and sour kielbasa

For those wondering, Edelman no longer has a boot on 
For those wondering, I am planning on taking the ACTs on September 12th. Just have to confirm once I get my syllabi. I will forward the official registration confirmation at that time.

For unrelated reasons
For us, yes because the deluge of patients is met with an absence of nursing staff. The pandemic had crushed the morale of the healthcare system and there are literally no nurses left to work 
For what I paid, worth it. Probably can get much better mattresses for similar or more $ if you wait for sales and actually do more research than I did, but I don't regret buying Leesa

Friends. I have sad news that is sure to really hit most of your hard. I have shaved my facial hair. I know it meant a lot to people like @#JustFacts✅, but it was time.

But alas, I have moved on and will focus my attention on my ever-growing abdominal girth. Thank you for your support during this tough time.

From my understanding of the two vaccine candidates, they use mRNA to stimulate the body to produce the viral spike protein. It's probably an oversimplification to say that the virus is not complicated, but the vaccine development would certainly be helped if researchers have found that the spike protein does not mutate at a significant rate. With viral classes like retroviruses, the reverse transcription mechanism is prone to mutations that make viruses like HIV so difficult to vaccinate against. For covid, we know that the spike protein is vital to the virus's ability to infect cells, so if it can be sequenced (yes), transcribed in mRNA (yes), injected into the body (yes), and produced by host cells in large enough quantities to stimulate an immune response (seems like it), without the protein mutating, then seems pretty hopeful that this will work
From NYT: "History gives little guide on the question of whether a president can be impeached once he leaves office, and House lawyers were racing to understand the legal and constitutional issues. There is precedent for doing so in the case of other high government officers. In 1876, the House impeached President Ulysses S. Grant’s war secretary for graft, even after he resigned from his post. The Senate at the time considered whether it still had jurisdiction to hear the case of a former official, and determined that it did.

From what I can gather, it started with her liking this tweet and then getting called out for it 
From what I can tell, the prescription monitoring program in Massachusetts was not mandated until 201w 
From what I have seen of the run game, I don't know why you hand it off on 3rd. Run a bootleg or something if you're worried about protection 
From what I hear, it sucks for the people who are able to see the colors
From what I hear, their staff is composed of like three people 
From what I read, McDermott (is that the name of the new coach?) ran the whole draft 
From what I see, the Dems are winning everything
From what I understand about the WMBA player issue, completely overlooking whether or not chronic Lyme exists (which is an incredibly contentious topic), the player's personal physician said she was at high risk for complications. A panel of independent doctors examined her case and disagreed. They relief on CDC guidelines, which do not place patients with Lyme disease in the "high risk" category. So basically it is one doctor's opinion versus the opinion of an independent panel and the CDC.
From what I'm reading he's a good interior rusher who can kick outside and is versatile along the DLine but he does have some weak spots and technique breakdowns. He's only 26 so he's still young, but he's a 6 year veteran with lots of NFL experience. 
From what I'm understanding, the league wasn't bullshit when Joe was in charge, but now that you've taken over, it's bullshit again. Thanks for running this into the ground, Darrow 
From what it sounds like on the radio, Tom Brady is a liability for his team.... 
From what I've heard, he's been known to skim the Groupme once or twice
From what I've read, I see the same thing. But there are also a bunch of fuckholes (lowercase, so it's an insult) who are harassing the police with rocks. I heard one report of a bottle of urine being thrown and heard another of mace being used in downtown crossing. Commission Evans says they don't appear to be on either side and are just there to be assholes 
From what Reddit is telling me about the MB thing: Arty T is a man of the people who is trying to run the company with the ideals of his family - treating employees well and keeping prices low for shoppers. The board wants to jack up prices to make more money. There is going to be a boycott (like there was 10 years ago when they tried to oust Arty T) and instead of the Guy Fawkes mask, we will burn down society in red MB jackets 
From when I bumped the post 
From which orifice? 
"From WSJ:

In his Monday night broadcast, Kimmel—a critic of President Trump—said, “the Maga Gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

“In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving,” he said.

Kimmel also said Vice President JD Vance and others in “MAGA-land” were trying to capitalize on Kirk’s death. 

Nexstar, which owns and operates 32 ABC affiliates in large and mid-sized markets, said Kimmel’s remarks about Kirk’s death and his followers were beyond the pale.

“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division."

Fuckholes, I come seeking your help. I have but one item left to move from my Boston abode to my new home. I am requesting the physical and mental assistance of ~2 people to assist in the lifting and loading of a couch. It is not absurdly heavy, but it doesn't fit in the elevator and thus requires careful navigation through the staircase. My hope is to have it moved sometime tomorrow evening, around 7 pm 
Fuckholes, I'm stuck at MGH for the time being having an infection in my arm drained and won't be able to go to the sox game tonight with chan, Joe, and Darrow. I'm happy to give my ticket away if someone wants to go
Fuckholes. Fairly late notice, but you're all invited to come to Stowe July 21-23 for some hiking and fishing and beer and whatever else you want to do. You were on such good behavior last time that Olivia's parents agreed to have you over again. Don't disappoint me. 
Fuckholes. Hypothetically if I were flying into NYC, would it be better to fly into LGA or JFK
Fuckholes. I will be going up to Stowe after work tomorrow and proposing to Olivia. I will update you with the results. Obviously she doesn't know so don't miraculously run into her tomorrow morning outside Dunkin or something (cc: @Jamie Bourque)

Full, uneventful story: there is a Pokemon gym on the street next to mine. The gym leader was weak and Olivia wanted to go for a walk, so I said I would go if we could stop there so I could take over the gym. Once we got there, some girl named Emma came out of no where and started asking me about my Pokemon. She literally followed us for about 15 minutes. Finally she ran into someone she knew and Olivia and I booked it

Fun fact. Went to Stowe cider on the second day it was open. Hated their cider. They only had one variety and it was ass. They no longer make that variety and now their three flagship ciders are dank and almost all of their season varieties are really good. Joff is a cider whisperer

Fwiw, he had already told me he might not run when you came 
FWIW, I have Kamara in my two other leagues and am the first seed in each of those playoffs. Makes me wonder what Bocker could have accomplished with him 
FWIW, I just read the results of a research survey of intensivists from 2016 and the medial # of clinical days/year was 169. 
FWIW, I was yelling for PI while the play was happening live, so it probably shouldn’t have been PI based on my homerism
FWIW, most of the liberal-leaning pundits I follow aren't upset about this.
FWIW, Shelbie said that Marcus was over-exaggerating and he didn't really break the couch as badly as he recalled to us, but that doesn't fit the #JustFacts✌️ narrative
FWIW, the announcers keep saying that it looks like Dillon is ready to come back in
FWIW, the boyfriend was not shot, was arrested, and then had charges dropped
FWIW, the leading infectious disease expert in the country went on meet the press today and said he wants a 2 week complete shutdown. He said his goal would be to be criticized for overreacting , because then he would know he did enough to stop the spread 
FWIW, there is conflicting evidence that body cams significantly reduce police use of excessive force
Fwiw, they said closer to 50 days

Game so lopsided that they are talking about hypothetical uniform numbers 
Game update 1: it's boring
Game was tied. Chargers in field goal range. 3 seconds left. Charges miss field goal attempt but Steelers were offsides. Steelers block the second try but were again offsides. Third try is good even though Steelers were offsides a third time. Chargers win 
Game wasn't streamed in the groupme. Didn't happen 
Game. Set. Darrowbitch is dead. You're all welcome.

Goody plays on his xbox 
Goody please start participating instead of coming in just to like my posts
Goody quit the league originally because he was going to be too busy applying to grad school to focus on the league. He then never applied to grad school. The league went through a tumultuous time with other league commissioners. Goody then forced his way back in the league after resuming the title of commissioner. He split up the Soy Sauce Oreo team (Jordan and Emyr), partnering with Emyr and leaving Jordan to fight for himself without any of the keepers that Jordan and Emyr had collected together. Goody then rigged the keeper rules to favor himself based on the players he and Emyr had but then continued to lose in the league playoffs. He eventually faded into irrelevance and moved on to rigging fantasy baseball 
Goody really doesn't think highly of our secondary

Goody trademarked Freshman Girl
Goody tried to set the league up to lock rosters at the end of the season so people couldn't pick up potential keepers in the offseason, which is a reasonable idea. However, he did not make this known to the Fuckholes, and several members of the league (Ryan, Jordan, and me) picked up players after the fantasy season. While this was not against any documented rule, ex-commissioner Goodwin took it upon himself to drop those players from each of our teams.

Goody, gunna need your opinion on the answer to a question from last night. The question was: which country, with a total of 16, has the highest number of official spoken languages? (the question went on to list several examples). We guessed India, which has a total of 22 "scheduled languages," meaning they were included in the most recent update to the Indian constitution. We were not given credit. That's some class A bullshit, right?
Goody, Gurley had a free run in the end zone but he chose to stay in bounds and not score to bleed clock. I didn't pay attention to the rest of the game

Goody, I know you're against abortion. That's what the blue bandana on your backpack signifies. And I respect your views and morals. 
Goody, I think the argument against defunding it is that the services provided fit a niche that isn't filled in other healthcare practices in many areas of the country. You shut it down, you restrict access to sexual health for both men and women. I am not saying that I support spending tax money on others health, but I think it should be a separate entity that charges fees like other doctors offices. Right now they don't and if they are defunded, they will probably close 
Goody, I think you made me see the light earlier. Fuck everyone else, I am ALL IN on trump 
Goody, I told you to never pick a divisional game. Especially on the road 
Goody, I took your advice and put my resume on Monster last night, as I'm trying to find a per diem/part time job to supplement my income (since I likely won't get the extra 10 hours a week that I asked for). Already had a recruiter email me. Is this what it feels like to be wanted?

Goody, I’m hungry. What should I eat 
Goody, I'd you were paying someone to bang your homie in a big spot, would you really trust someone to do the job for free? You have to pay so that shit doesn't come back to you

Gotcha. Never heard of the last one. I have FA and our school puts in a group order for Sketchy, Pathoma, and UWorld in the fall, so I'll have those
Gotcha. So basically you'd have to be within arms reach if the cartridge has already been fired? Thank you for educating me and engaging in dialogue about complicated issues.
Gotcha. Yeah right now, they break a lot of those classes up. Like we already did intro to micro, but I guess we have a micro lab for a lot of the year next year. And we’ve done intro to pharm, but then each of the systems blocks has its own pharm component, which I guess is good but I’m not going to remember anything from the intro course by the time I get to next year

Great 
Great $34 keeper value right there 
Great 4th and 5 play right there 
Great analysis

Great blocks on 3rd down 
Great call back for defining accounting principles but not sharing your opinion. A+
Great call by the browns to elect to kick. Glad I didn't second guess them

Great now that you're here
Great participation from almost everyone in the MyWoodIsPlywood CoC clan. 
Great plan by Bock. Fly to Vegas. Wait for Morcus to lose all of his money and put up his house as collateral. Watch him lose that too. Wait for him to get taken to a back alley, never to be seen again.
Great play by JC, even better play by Mills to recover that before it rolled out of bounds 
Great play by Kirk on the last play of the game
Great play by Will Fuller. Definitely worth $34

Gronk is better 
Gronk just scored a touchdown on a fumble 
Gronk playing operation
Gronk would suit up but sit out the first quarter, a la Welker's discipline in 2011 for making fun of Rex 
Gronk, Slater, and Chris Jones are literally two streets over for me participating in an event that I was invited to. And I am stuck on a conference call.

Gutta block this 
Gutta burn some clock. Can't give them this much time 
Gutta catch that 
Gutta catch that 
Gutta feel bad for Jimmy G. Was overhyped and touted as the next heir apparent to the Patriots Dynasty. Then he gets left for dead with the Nerrrrs in exchange for a 2nd round pick and now has fallen down the QB ranks until he has become a liability for his team 
Gutta fucking catch that
Gutta get after that gnar 
Gutta get those Hamilton tickets time who's 
Gutta have a mandingo to use the hole 
Gutta hit Mondre there. Only one guy to beat

Gutta love that Duke Johnson vulture
Gutta make sure you see that ball out. Also Barmore held like no other on that play 
Gutta make up for the Kane's donut I had for breakfast 
Gutta make up the difference by saving on tasting menus
Gutta pick this 
Gutta really feel bad for the Auburn player who committed that foul

Gutta topple both field goal posts and carry them through the mods
Gutta turn everything red. The state and the uniforms 
Gutta write something catchy, because ain't no one clicking on "Mel Kiper Jr.'s Mock Draft v12.6" or "ESPNs projected win/loss record for all 32 teams before their roster is even finalized or preseason happens!"
Guy, I almost lost my arm in a vicious t door accident. I think I treasure life s lot more now. 
Guys
Guys back to important stuff. You know what's funny. Our madden franchise plays almost exclusively in the nickel and that leaves mayo the off linebacker out on the bench. Just like on the pats this season!
Guys Candice just looked at me 
Guys do we really think that Joe actually knows these or is he just saying it so he doesn't make a stupid guess? 
Guys do you remember when bill didn't want to pay Malcolm butler and everyone was pissed off? 
Guys don't start your best players when you play me in fantasy. You could hurt my confidence because I am a huge pussy 
Guys give Jordan a break. It's not his fault he supports a cheater and drug abuser, a team that collapsed after a 3-1 lead in the finals, and the niners 
Guys Goody was the last one to say happy birthday 
Guys I almost died at work today
Guys i am a little buzzed from my bottle of wine and amaro from dinner 
Guys i am getting concerned that no one else is awake and playing TotK right now 
Guys I don't think he gets the reference
Guys I figured out why Chan has been so quiet today. He committed seppuku after reading this tweet 
Guys I got rejected from Harvard 
Guys I got the email about reunion 
Guys I had to give darrow directions to 93 from my apartment because his gps app isn't working. He hasn't texted that he's home yet. What if he didn't make it safely?!
Guys I have a confession
Guys I just heard that Goodell hangs out with Bill Cosby and Jared from subway #FireGoodell
Guys I just tackled darrow. He didn't know what hit him 
Guys I literally just saw that the nerrrs won 
Guys I think that AB is a free agent 
Guys I think we have a wealth of evidence showing that @It’s Coming Home would make a terrible AD 
Guys I think we should table all talk of the game for the well-being of my good friend Chan 
Guys I want to participate in shitting on Joe and Marcus but I have to go take my renal exam 
Guys I was just thinking. Using steroids increases your risk of musculoskeletal injury. JJ Watt gets injured every season...
Guys I was told that Castellanos was bad and Lonergan was the future number one pick. I’m confused as to why we are bad
Guys I was told that this season would go without a hitch and that nothing bad would happen 
Guys if there are other pictures, you should share them with the group. For science. 
Guys I'm back to commuting on the t this week. Stay tuned, I know how much you guys live for my updates 
Guys I'm going to an alcohol recovery meeting for class tonight. Do you think they'll have an open bar or cash only?
Guys I'm on the bus. When do I get bus aids?
Guys in all honesty, I'm so done with the college football talk
Guys it feels good to be a winner 
Guys it's a football Sunday. You're talking about the wrong sport 
Guys it's Joe's metric. We can't expect much from him. Let's just go with it

Guys Morcus looks great. Can’t convince me he’s over 190
Guys my two year work anniversary is coming up next week and I might finally get my own desk. Things are looking up 
Guys rape is a serious word and should not be thrown around lightly like this. This type of language only perpetuates rape culture. Please only use the term rape when you are referring to what Jordan and Emyr did to Goody's team in the playoffs several years ago 
Guys remember when Becker could have kept Edelman for $18 this year and now he wants to trade for him 
Guys Revolution are down 2-1 in extra time

Guys you're going to scare Marcus away. He is startled easily 
Guys, are we having a Red Sox circlejerk right now? I think this is unprecedented 
Guys, back to real sports with relevant athletes. Michael Vick is retiring 
Guys, Bocker hasn't messaged the groupme since this happened. 
Guys, Bocker hasn't snacked at work in like a week and he refused all alcohol on Friday night. He's taking this seriously 
Guys, Bocker is working real hard today. I'm a bit confused 
Guys, Canada didn't like all of the negative comments. Officially have da Rona 
Guys, goody was the LAST one to wish Morcus a happy birthday
Guys, had to switch up my blue cheese again. Market basket (fake grocery store) was all out of crumbled blue cheese. Had to grate it myself. Hope it still pulls the dish all together 
Guys, how much longer do we have to pretend that we care about what Goody says? These last 10 years have been hard, not sure I can take much more 
Guys, I can't wait for chip kelly get fired and my prediction at the beginning of the season be right.

Guys, I just realized something 
Guys, I know you can't tell because of how stoic I've been in the GroupMe, but I'm not taking this #BradyBreakup news well 
Guys, I saw Kovin today. He's not dead 
Guys, I think my team may suck again 
"Guys, I will help you out and rejoin the league if all my demands are met:
1) I get to pick my whole team before anyone else gets a pick
2) I get to claim any player I want from someone else's team at any point during the season
C) my buy in is $0 but $200 for everyone else and I win the whole pot when I win
IV) no league punishment if I lose "
Guys, I'd like to announce that Bocker got Kristen's time wrong. She actually finished in 5:14:39, not 5:15:39. Smh
"Guys, if I could get serious for a second. Olivia and my friend who was in the hospital for heart issues before is still in the hospital. His LVAD isn't helping his condition as much as the doctors had hoped so he got bumped up to the highest priority heart transplant list. He'll remain in the hospital until he gets a heart or pretty much until he dies. A GoFundMe had already raised a good amount for the family, but not enough to cover the costs of his co-pays for the surgeries and hospital stays and for his family to stay in Boston to visit him. 

The gym Olivia goes to holds charity workouts every month, and this month the money goes to him. The workout is this Saturday, the gym is somewhere in Somerville. You basically pay $10 and all the money goes directly to his GoFundMe. I know it's short notice and not likely that any of you will want to/be able to go, but I promised I would spread the word. I'm happy to pass along info if anyone thinks they would want to go. "

Guy's, it's back
Guys, it's okay. The Bruins didn't play tonight
Guys, lets all remember how goody is a huge piece of shit and left town so he didn't have to draft with us 
Guy's, lets not attack Chan. We all know that this is Joe's fault
Guys, Marc Sessler of the Around the NFL Podcast made sandwich props that: a) a coach would resign during the season; b) there would be a controversy involving a cheerleader during the season 
Guys, Marcus had more than 5 posts yesterday! 
Guys, Marcus liked one of my messages. He's alive!
Guys, maybe Gigi's boyfriend is fine with her hanging with John naked in the same hotel room because he thinks that John is the token gay
Guys, Miss Peaches is out of the hospital. I hope this information is a relieving to you as it is to me
Guys, my butthole is real tight right now
Guys, no spoilers on the Pro Bowl score. I've been in the ICU all day, want to make sure I watch the game without knowing the outcome 
Guys, pats are only -7 against the colts next week. That's free money. Make that bet. 
Guys, please keep all anti-BC FB opinions in the Fuck Morcus GroupMe.
Guys, remember that time I beat Goody in the survivor pool 
Guys, the cable went out. No tv or wifi. Now I know what it feels like to live in the early 20th century (or in the present day south) 
Guys, the fuckholes have the opportunity, nay, the responsibility to do the right thing here. Let's ruin her life and career!
Guys, the wifi in my dorm/apartment sucks. I can't even stream redzone 
Guys, we're on to football. Stick to what matters in life 
Guys, you are letting Morcus move the goalposts again (even though he's still wrong). The argument was never Jalen versus Cam. It was that Jalen was a bad draft pick

Guys. It's almost sundress season. 🐐
Guys. Not going to the gym today. However heading out now for what I hope will be a 3mi run 
Guys. Offer still stands if anyone is interested in getting a 2 bedroom with Olivia and me. We're zeroing in on Southie. I know it's a super tempting offer but don't all jump at once. We'll consider all candidates equally. 
Guys. Reggie Wayne says that Brady can't win the MVP because he cheated this year 
Guys. Sorry, gutta keep the masks on 
Guys. We have to help find Brodi.

Harris did win by 10 million. Trump got all the illegals to vote for him. Everyone says there was voting fraud like you wouldn't believe. They're saying that this was the most fraudulent election ever. 
Harris is amazing. Fuck Sony Michel
Harrison's 
Harrison's is my favorite restaurant in Stowe. But she will need a reservation like a month in advance. The Whip is a consolation restaurant for when she can't get into Harrison's. 
Harry has been blocking really well since he's gotten playing time

Have y'all seen this? (Ignore the opening in Dutch)
"Have you already seen a doctor because you’ve been having low thyroid symptoms? And have they tested your thyroid and told you that your thyroid levels are “normal”? We see many patients who have been told that there is nothing wrong with them, yet they’re still symptomatic. Unfortunately, this is all too common, and the problem lies not with YOU (as your doctors might suggest), but with inadequate testing and improper reading of the results.

It is considered standard practice by many physicians to check only your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level, and possibly your T4 levels. IF they see a problem with your TSH, only then may they order more testing. If the TSH levels come back “normal,” then they often assume that everything is fine. Even if a wider panel is run, a patient can still be in normal range and yet still have low thyroid symptoms. This can be extremely frustrating to be told that nothing is wrong with you, but yet you still feel bad."
Have you considered murder? 
Have you done the hazing ritual?

Having a GroupMe with just Joe in it is not fun tho 
Having a life 
Having a trademark PF Chang's order would be the worst thing about Mark Davis 
Having a voter card does not mean he is guaranteed to vote 
Having an apple watch makes you a garbage human 
Having an extra floppy wiener 
Having children? In this economy? 
Having fun isn't hard when you have a library card. 
Having Ian Eagle on the call makes it much worse 
Having less than a billion dollars is such a poor move 
Having not read the article, it took me much longer to realize that you weren't talking about baseball steals than I would like to admit 
Having to do Jordan's job for him smh
Having to interact with humans all day is the fucking worst 
Having to retuck your shirt in alone takes infinitely longer than the whole act of digletting itself 
Having watched none of the pats game due to being at work, I assume the fix was on 
Hawaii is on the exempt list
Hawkins continues his streak of making bad plays whenever he gets playing time. He dropped that like Boutte/Thornton 
Hawley is a fucking moron 
HBD @Taylor Darrow 
Hbd joe
hcg is not estrogen. Which is what he took. He took it to reverse the steroids' testicle shrinking effects 
He @Skimmer 
He absolutely has had the chance to win games as time is winding down!
He absolutely has not read any of the messages to know that no one cares 
He actually has the Sox game on in the background 
He actually plays hockey. Does he play baseball too?
He actually stands about 3 feet away and they walk up to his face and push him 
He actually studied in Barcelona, which is in a region that wishes themselves to be distinctly separate from Spain. Check your privilege 
He ain't gunna be happy
He ain't playing. 2qb system with Pop and Malik Cunningham who may not even be on the roster still
He almost lived with us (I think) junior year 
He already called Schefter to ask him to hack into the hospital and leak her medical records
He already did have an income stream. Half of his pregnant, hardworking wife's money 
He already has become an FLB
He already said he was studying for step 1 when we first brought it up 
He already said that this might be his last run 
He also doesn't know how to run 
He also doesn't smoke cigarettes since like last winter
He also drafted Shady McCoy, who was promptly cut 
He also failed to point out that the data only capture 29 states, and there is no indication which states were chosen. They very well could all be right or left leaning states. We will never know.
He also forgot how to catch when he got opportunities
He also gave our room code to the guys across from us, which I didn't mind, until Chris Marino would barge in at 4 or 5 am after he was done editing for The Heights and talk to Treven, who was still up because of his assignments, in our room while I was trying to sleep.
He also had blood cancer, so he was pretty fucked 
He also handles raw, fishy meat in his mouth just fine 
He also has one other 2nd place finish and two other 3rd place finishes in the NYC Marathon
He also invited me on Facebook to about 1000 events at clubs in Boston.
He also lost to me 
He also loves Ed Reed and Troy Polamalu
He also once spilled flour all over my toaster oven, which I meticulously kept gluten free, and then didn’t tell me for several weeks until I had to have an endoscopy due to ongoing systems (which ended up not being due to Celiac)
He also ran a company into the ground and cost the Rhode Island government like $68 million dollars or something 
He also responds to digs about Cam Newton
He also said "I have a place in my heart for LeGarrette, because I have him a start." He signed LG as an undrafted rookie and then cut him before the season started. 
He also said he heard the Fire Mayo chants rain down upon him 
He also said that manning was to blame for the pick six against the saints. Said he telegraphed the play the whole way 
He also said that Nigerian immigrants “won’t want to go back to their huts once they see America”
He also said that none of the fans are qualified to do what Mayo is doing 
He also says all of Rapaport’s info is true 
He also some fools like you on the bball court
He also sucks Trump's nuts more than Goody sucks Lebron's 
He also supports them 
He also talked about Brandon Bolden when asked about "patriots trio of running backs" and completely left out Lewis and White 
He also vetoed the defense spending bill, which is likely to be overturned in congress 
He also was one of the dudes who claimed Obama was born outside of the US
He and the Skins are now 100% irrelevant and should be barred from any further discussion in this or any other football groupme
He apparently had a HS recruit over his house, punched him during a game of pick up, then went back into his house and came out with his gun in his waistband for the kid to see 
He apparently has the money to pay someone to photoshop for him
He apparently stopped one step short of an actual stay at home order like (from what I understand at least) what SF did. 
He asked us on Fortnight last night when the deadline was. I told him that half of them had already been added
He asked yesterday 
He at least wore a polo to fogo 
He back 
He bad 
He ball wasn't in the air 
He basically got full access this year 
He basically said fuck joff and everything he stands for 
He better damn apologize. I don't want no lil b curse following him to the Celtics 
He better stop attracting attention off the field
He blocked at least 3 guys on that play. Possibly 6
He broke up with his girlfriend and immediately started dating Gisele. Found out afterwards that his ex was knocked up. Still spends time with the kid and is on good terms with his ex
He burned a time out after punting to GT so kind of 
He can bowl with a dislocated shouldwer
He can comment in the GroupMe if he disagrees
He can dance on logos all he wants. But critics are dancing on his grave rn 
He can do what he wants as long as it is fair 
He can handle it. He's on his way to poop-prose
He can have whatever clothing he wants in his locker. It still is completely irrelevant to the game of football. There's no reason to write a story about it. The writers are literally just trying to write a story about how tom Brady supports trump's racist views 
He can lift the hammer 
He can make an easy $5 blowing someone in central park
He can make an owner sell a team, correct?
He can recruit the guys you need to win in division I basketball. Just keep the hookers away from the team
He can try and hold out to restructure after 2 years, so he will certainly try and get more than the minimum after that. But still a steal for anyone, as long as he wasn't actually all murdery
He can’t possibly be still writing his message. It must be like a total of four sentences 
He can’t with all of those billable hours 
He can't afford to bet on draft kings. Too many student loans
He can't be any better than me at top golf 
He can't play football on a blood thinner. Risk of bleeding (externally, internally, in the brain etc.) way too high
He can't read the rules
He can't tell you or he'd have to kill you
He caught it 
He caught the ball, tucked it, and turned up field. Probably should have been a catch and fumble but it was very close 
He combined for 0 carries on his first 6 teams 
He comes back tomorrow after I take my shelf i
He compared the team to the Lions during the first year of Dan Campbell's tenure. He was cut by the Lions during training camp during the first year of Dan Campbell's tenure 
He contributes with his friendship. 
He conveniently got esophageal cancer immediately after completely misreporting on deflategate entirely so everyone would feel bad for him #11of12Footballs
He could call it the United States Football League it something like that to show how American he is 
He could have also booked the wrong date, booked the wrong hotel, or not booked it at all
He could have done a lot of coke 
He could have had a different opinion
He could have photoshopped that award. Not convinced
He could have picked a game when I didn't have to be on shift at 7am the next day, but nope. He never truly wanted me there
He could have posted that in here himself
He could have used that emotional pain to inflict physical pain on Trump 
He could move that arm. Literally all you need
He could score more than a bucket if went all Monstars on MJ's ass 
He could still fumble 
He could still retire. I'm not convinced he will ever be healthy enough to play again 
He coulda benefited from starting Miller
He couldn't get open, couldn't catch, and was basically good for one catch for 20 yards each game. 
He couldn't have got in with my ticket. They checked IDs
He couldn't make it on a team whose starting running back had 29 yards through three games 
He couldn't text BB before the game

He definitely should play baseball 
He definitely unsubscribed from The Path newsletter 
He deserves every sack coming to him this season

He did it with me. Skimmer
He did not 
He did play. One snap that didn't count
He did say it here
He did say that
He did tell us yesterday that he was expecting a baby in 9 months
He did. He did it before you exclaimed happiness over now being able to tell the two apart 
He didn’t like the last one. Probably because he skimmed 
He didn't ask about crunch bars, idiot
He didn't disappear. I know exactly where he is. 
He didn't even do that. 
He didn't even have any tests! You can't call that school 
He didn't even have the decency to respond 
He didn't even hold onto the pass smh
He didn't even sign up for a marathon
He didn't even touch him, ref! 
He didn't even win the marathon. And I bet you guys weren't even drunk. Doesn't sound like it was worth it to watch 
He didn't have possession! The fix is in! 
He didn't have to answer that question that way. But he did and now the program is on the hot seat 
He didn't have to because he's a fantasy god and I couldn't even hold his jockstrap 
He didn't hit those home runs on my birthday, he hit them on his birthday. You don't even appreciate the full history of nomar. Your arguments are filled with lies!
He didn't need my protection 
He didn't post after this 
"He didn't say specifically on this podcast but the things we know/think stressed his relationship with NFL media included:
- pitching a fit when graver was let go
- spoiling BB's appearance on the roast, which was a surprise
- playing clips from the show which reportedly cost a lot of money to obtain "
He didn't send it to me. Ipso facto he would have deserved it if he died. 
He didn't send it to you? Awkward....
He died 
He died during appeal so he legally isn't guilty
He died plenty of times today

He does count 
He does get paid with your tax dollars
He does have another job and has to earn his 6th master's degree
He does tv during preseason 
He doesn’t care about you or any of us 
He doesn’t even look upset after throwing that. He doesn’t have the heart 
He doesn’t understand what it’s like to be on the bottom
He doesn't actually have his own card. He uses a card associated with Kristen's account. Therefore if he gets his info stolen, Kristen gets her info stolen 
He doesn't believe in the importance of the Oval Office and it's occupant 
He doesn't come in here anymore since crocked Bocker is mean
He doesn't deserve these good things happening. Now I know God isn't real 
He doesn't deserve us
He doesn't hate me because we're going to Netflix and Chill #BockerOrBust
He doesn't have to. Joe never was friends with us again 
He doesn't like to talk about it
He doesn't mean that kind of biggest
He doesn't play for the pats. Fuck him 
He doesn't play for the pats. Fuck him.

He forgot the Pats 
He fucking sucks
He fumbled into the end zone
He fumbled. That's all 
He gave a speech to the governors the other day saying they need to put regulations on artificial intelligence before the robots take over the world. Apparently not well received 
He gave me gluten containing cookies as a Christmas present. I could have guessed he wanted me to suffer 
He gets brown square in the head. It's a hit on a defenseless receiver. I can't find a better angle, but when you watch it from the other way, it's clearly dirty 
He gets fired after three more losses 
He gets paid $7.06 million/year 
He gets pushed backwards (legal) and loses his balance, falls towards a Knights player who then pushes him while he's falling.
He gets tagged in a post and comes in here to see that you're hating on him
He good
He got arrested 11/30 for a casino fight or something I think 
He got good at criticizing quarterbacks by growing up with @Jamie Bourque 
He got his leg landed on while it was straight and out stretched. It really didn't look like much 
He got left off the ranking because of the decision to start him
He got out of bounds but was pushed backwards, so the clock still runs 
He got the W
HE GOT THERE EARLY
He got youjizz'd. Which is only second to being daredorm'd
He had -11 yards rushing at one point in the 4th quarter last game. 
He had 69.9% of voters. The other two were low 30%
He had 9 touchdowns to 14 picks and s 56.1% completion percentage in the sec. He's proven that he can't compete in the sec. It's unproven how well he can play in the ACC. 
He had a secret Twitter. A reporter found it by looking through the accounts that followed his children
He had an elbow injury all year last year.
He had another pussy health condition too. If you get an aortic aneurysm before age 30, get better genetics

He has 14 points on 30 yards. Touchdowns are weighted way too much. 
He has 400 unread texts 
He has a $400m Fox contract or something like that
He has a blood clot that has traveled and lodged in his lungs. It prevents oxygen from diffusing into the blood stream and can be significantly impactful depending on the size of the clot and where it lodged. It means he will likely be on blood thinners to break up the clot and prevent more from forming for several months
He has a mental disorder and Goody et al. is enabling him instead of encouraging him to seek help
He has a premier cable package. His package certainly is huge. 
He has a record of heinous offenses. Can't be ignored when list making. However, Bocker should have yielded to precedent and left @Channie Mae  off the list
He has a shot to throw another pick to re-end the game 
He has an article shitting on the Pats for working out AP last season
He has an autoimmune condition destroying his heart and had an LVAD placed, but thanks for the well wishes. I'll pass them along. But also fuck you 
He has an entire ballot that is different from mine 
He has an option that they have to pick up. I incorrectly said "resign." However, I refuse to admit I was wrong. Fuck your mother.

He has terrible luck 
He has to stop 
He has too much loyalty. Fuck him 
He has two holes in his heart caused by Bocker 
He hasn't been proven wrong yet.  High school quarterback coaches get elevated to starting in the NFL all the time 
He hasn't been the same since 
He hasn't photoshopped anything since he's been back. Why do we keep him around?
He hasn't said no
He hasn't sat for last year's punishment
He hasn't told me if I have a bingo yet

He hates Disney. Trump likes Disney because he is in the Hall of Presidents
He hikes now 
He hit three home runs in one game (including a grand slam), which happened to be his birthday. And I was there. Can confirm 🐐🐐🐐
He hurt it days ago but apparently the NBA is so archaic, that doctors don't know how to diagnose meniscus tears

He is not a surgeon so he really should have a job called flight surgeon 
He is not a 🐳
He is not educated
He is not part of the Fuckswoles, obviously 
He is not. He must be a recent grad
He is on the cover of Madden. Averaged 354 yards/season 
He is required by NFL policy to participate in media interviews. His interviews should revolve around football. That should be the standard for all athletes. Don't waste their time 
He is said to be doing well with a "normal medical condition" and will be discharged today or tomorrow 
He is saying you skimmed me mentioning the event while you were on hiatus
He isn't a free waiver because I dropped him after waivers were processed 
He isn't exactly the next Mensa club member
He isn't reaching for a baton 
He isn't trolling. He actually likes LeBron. It's fucking insane. Two diehard Celtics fans in this GroupMe have respect for an egomaniac who sucks so hard that he has to rely on washed up Celtics great Ray Allen and future Celtics dumpster fire Kyrie Irving to win anything
He isn't wrong
He just caught a 54 yard touchdown (revis got fucking torched)
He just clotheslined Crosby on that 3rd down play 
He just did

He just literally slewfooted Marchand 
He just murdered someone. Have to hand it to him 
He just stole Dre Kirkpatrick’s lunch money and gave him a swirled in the same play 
He just told me that they already signed the lease, and then the landlord tried to force them to sign an amendment that banned music and smoking pot and now they want out 
He keeps claiming his college age son is a better basketball player than every current NBA star 
He keeps running forward and he has a first with room to spare 
He killed a man in 1989 
He kinda sneaky sucks 
He knew it would drop him 5 rounds from 2nd to 7th 
He knew what he was doing 
He knows why. It's a special type of boner 
He lands one punch, the dude falls, and then he hits him once when he's down. Not what I call beating the shit out of someone 
He learned from the best
He learned to spin zone from Kraft
He leaves Friday
He left as I was reading through the messages that I missed

He left us in our time of need 
HE LIKED MY POST 
He likes doodoo dropped on his body during the nasty
He likes everything
He listened to me 
He literally got rich because people respect how he talks about politics and the future of the country. Is he going to say "noooo don't give me money, redistribute it to all of the poor people in your neighborhood."
He literally has done exactly what they asked him to do. What they asked him to do was trash 
He literally just graduated 
He literally posted about a mother dying while in labor. He basically wrote a novel about that family. If someone who knows the family saw that, he should get fucked so hard

He literally quit on his team before Rodgers ended up there 
He literally sucks. Jacoby Brissett is better than he is 
He locked it for Joe
He looked ok walking off 
He looks hurt. 
He looks like @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
He looks like a nerd with his glasses compared to some of the other ripped gymnasts. He took his glasses off, nailed his routine, and got them a medal
He looks like he's in a lot of pain. #ThoughtsAndPrayers
He looks up the answer and still can't get it right 
He made a comment about Andy dalton that was obviously rehearsed and practiced. He said something like "they wanted to make the red rifle look like a red Ryder be gun"
He made a waiver move 8 minutes ago 
He made at least two or three deliberate attempts to hurt patriots players that the NFL is reviewing. After getting suspended for three games 
He made every game worth 1 point 
He made his bed by choosing to go back to Cleveland. Now he must lie in it 
He made this claim before he had a peloton
He made time for trivia, even though you didn't

He must have heard that @AbadBot was going to be there. That man is constantly getting fuckholes together
He must know the one attending in my department who is gulag worthy 
He must not like money 
He must still be orgasming
He needs a new PR person. Whoever let him go on TV is dumb 
He needs to focus on walking up stairs 
He needs to stop before he digs himself deeper into this hole of ignorance 
He never completed the process of a catch, so you can’t say he had possession over the end zone line 
He now gets to go into other facilities, conduct the interviews with players and coaches, and then also gets to partially own and run a team 
He objectively will not be in Boston tomorrow 
He obviously was up there for a number of years. He's been washed up for a while now though, imo
He obviously works in Kevin O's offense. Trade JJ and keep Sam 
He only gets one tribute
He only played 4 games this year? 
He only specified one specific pin
He only touches boobies 
He or she sounds like a smart man or woman
He photoshops cool pictures 
He picked me up and held me. I never felt more safe 
He played for the Texans, goody 
He played in 15 games. I believe he was rehabbing from an ACL?

He prefers LinkedIn over us 
He probably had one alcohol and had an OD

He probably planned the secret hitler for his B school friends weeks ago 
He probably skimmed the injury updates 
He probably still uses Facebook

He probably thinks he's too good for us now that he's going to the Masters
He probably thought looking at you was enough of a joke 
He probably tried to tamper with kraits balls 
he probably wanted to eat dinner at a normal time 
He probably wants to use them to put illegal mexican children through school and provide abortions at planned parenthood 
He put a deposit down for a house painter and the dude ghosted him
He puts the whistle to his mouth before he turns. But either way, rex being there influenced the whistle 
He quit on us
He ran backwards and the Seahawks got penetrated 
He ran the presnap motion and then crashed down inside to block 
He ran the, "two women, two hotel rooms, one night" route 
He read one of the many posts about him. I hardly think that means he didn't skim
He really has blossomed into a great player, and obviously a great person. Just think about what potential he would have had Addazio didn't hamper him
He refused to make @joffbot. I made @joffbot. Now he has to make @joffbot work 
He refused to take the test even knowing he would be removed by the most successful commissioner in league history

He said “well I don’t want to financially hurt this guy. He’s a small business owner. I just want my money back” 
He said before the game that the browns were the same team they play every year and that they hadn't changed. So obviously the browns used that for motivation and now the internet is flaming JuJu again for constantly giving motivation to the other team and for seemingly wanting to be a TikTok star more than a football player

He said he'd bench his players if they didn't stand for the national anthem

He saw that the D was in the end zone and wanted Howard to catch and run it in 
He says he's healthy. McVay says he's healthy 
He says we are getting Julio, so he must be reliable 
He scanned my passport, took my picture, and scanned my finger prints. Literally no words uttered except instructions for each step and "all set, have a nice day"
He seemed more fired up on that last play

He sent me a Christmas card last year 
He served the hell out of us 
He shares your name Becker. Don't do him this injustice 
He shot his eye out 
He should be cut simply for being that stupid 
He should be fired
He should be focused on his upcoming weigh-in. Now is not the the time to enjoy what he eats 
He should be honored to share my name

He should bulk up to 300 lbs and throw shotput
He should call trader Danny and let him know

He should have been a better coach 
He should have been fired 6 years ago 
He should have been fired for signing Tebow, to be honest 
He should have gone to B school

He should post a picture of Maine 
He should probably drink whole milk instead of skim
He should probably go to the ER so he doesn't have any permanent damage. A month is a lot longer than 4 hours 
He should probably worry about getting the nomination first 
He should read Reddit. I was on there for 3 minutes and now know everything necessary to understand mma 
He should really declare that he's trans. Get him at least a 5% bump in the polls 
He should try not to be losing by 15 points 
He shouldn't celebrate by spinning the ball
He shouldn't have to apologize for being more of a man than you are 
He shows more than flashes to hot girl Taylor 
He single handedly convinced china to work really really hard to stop North Korea 
He sounds dumb 
He sounds like a prophet
He spent 10 minutes during my haircut trying to find where he could get jerseys for his girlfriend and him before the game 
He spent all his money stopping me from returning to Boston for sixteen hours 
He spoke too many languages and forgot how to punt 
He stayed up until the 15th inning last night at the Sox game. Oh wait, he probably left in the 7th and just wanted to sleep in 
He stepped on it too! 
He still won't help you beat me in the Melrose league 
He stopped cutting mid cut to buy CC tickets for tonight 
He stormed the towers so we could storm the field
He straight bad 
HE STRIKES AGAIN 
He sucks in the playoffs every year
He sucks now
He sucks now and everyone else is better 
He sucks outside 
He sucks. So glad the Sox got rid of him
He suffered a life threatening pinky injury while blocking Suh, though 
He switched to being a Giants fan in 2011 before the refs went on strike and the Super Bowl was canceled 
He talks to his autographed nomar picture the he keeps under his pillow at night 
He tells me that I'm a fucking scrub all the time 
He the article I was reading said that Trump was considering one of the senior administrators as the #2 in the department so I'm not sure 
He then finished his rant with “plus I fucking hate Nate Silver because he wouldn’t come give a guest lecture for my class a few years ago” 
He then works with one of our ultrasound fellows who just graduated and is now an attending there
He thinks he’s above the Capital Ore bank guy too
He thought the draft was Friday so he's going to be with Kristen and her parents (presumably) Saturday. So he wanted to draft Friday because he can't even do it remotely on Saturday 
He threw a bat at someone and can't run out a ground ball. Those were years apart.
He threw a bunch of parties during Covid lockdown and stories about it leaked two years later and people were like "booo"
He threw a punch at the first guy and then tried to hit another one and got the ref. 
He threw it into quadruple coverage
He threw two picks but he got hurt. Hurts in now leading them to tying and winning touchdowns 
He told me at my wedding that he "purposely fucked with (my) stuff by putting flour all over it senior year" so either he's really bad at joking or he deserves mistreatment 
He told me that he felt better today, but its towards the end of the day where he starts feeling worse. Mostly congestion earlier
He told me you said to say hi but did not give me a hard time 
He took a homeopathic regimen to boost his immunity against COVID
He took credit for BB choosing not to call a timeout before the Malcolm Butler play. In terms of his errors, in miniscule. But don't say "we won a super bowl here by doing the opposite" when you had no impact on the decision BB made 
He took him very late two years ago. When he didn't play at all 
HE TOUCHED MAC JONES TOO HARD 
He tried to take down a legend and history (and science) proved him wrong
He triple sources all of his scoops 
He uninvited everyone except that one dude who "wasn't there" but posted videos from the reception on insta
he used PEDs
He voted to support a law that would impose the death penalty against anyone who killed a police officer and this person has their panties in a bunch because apparently that's anti-black legislation
He walked off a radio set when Kirk Minihan called him a pedophile. What a bitch
He walked off on his own power but he was down for a while 
He wanted it to be at St Mary's but could not work it out
He wants the fix to be in. He's used to the fix being in for him
He was a bad singer
He was a big fan
He was a disappointment this year 
He was a good player, it’s too bad. 
He was a resident from 2016 to 2019 then an EMS fellow until 2020
He was absolutely in 
He was already a western mass resident 
He was always my friend after graduation 
He was always my friend. We shared many bowls of cinnamon Chex 
He was always my roommate and my small bowel buddy 
He was always our savior 
He was an actor. 
He was at Chan’s, so I can in fact confirm that. 
He was attacking Dems so I ignored him
He was black and had a buzzcut
He was Canadian and not will arnett 
He was considered a top candidate throughout the season
He was definitely insurance before the draft and is now irrelevant 
He was DJing. Just how the cookie crumbles 
He was doomed from birth 
He was dropped when put on ir
He was going to get drafted 
He was going to retire on Sunday and collect a full pension. 
He was hit in the backfield too
He was in Eagle EMS with us as an observer (not an EMT)
He was in the back with his hand up 
He was invited as the DJ...
He was just using to protect his teammates from hazardous and potentially intoxicating fumes. 
He was knighted as a doctor 3 years ago
He was looking for housing. Skimmer 
He was mad that saints scored at end of game when it was already over
He was making cookies in our room in Edmonds 
He was more impacted by the ankle than the arm. He barely could run 
He was never a real nazi obviously since he’s on my team 
He was never paying it. Only @Jamie Bourque was a rich
He was not quick to denounce. It took him over a day 
He was on his own 20ish yard line 
He was on the keeper list. Blame Jordan 
He was one of my co chief resident
He was only on the team for the pommel horse. They kept him in a back room until it was his time to complete
He was past the line of scrimmage 
He was picked up mid season by goody his rookie year. Kept last year 
He was playing snaps later in the game yesterday 
He was pretty much a shoe in to replace Boehner as speaker of the house but he decided not to run for the position 
He was probably busy pissing BB off 
He was probably tired of your mom not remembering who he was
He was recognized because he was a coach and mentor to the organization for his career. If he didn't do that, he wouldn't have a freaking pole named after him 
He was referencing not engaging in a fantasy league 
He was second in MVP voting last year but he should not have come back this year. He lost too much, both on and off the field, to make this worth it 
He was so appalled that he hoped he read it wrong the first time
He was such a nice boy
He was temporarily removed due to lack of positivity 
He was the best at handing the ball off

He was the president who abolished slavery. He was the principal who gave me detention 
He was there and we all enjoyed his company 
He was too busy pinning posts to talk to me 
He was warned 
He was watching on his phone. He didn't have service. He was going on another maskless hike with people who will end up testing positive. 
He was/is pretty damn good in the playoffs 
He was/is the majority whip. Which I don't really understand what the whip does, except for whip the votes. But if I was a position I would want to be the party whip. Sounds like a fun job 
He wasn't actually in Boston tho
He wasn't found not guilty. He cut a plea deal to reduce the charge to obstruction of justice. And then he won the Super Bowl the next year.....
He went down pretty easy on some plays yesterday
He went off 
He went platinum with no features!
He went straight up
He who dates outside of Patriots fandom shall forever be cursed with whiskey dick. 
He will be a great back up for Zappe
He will be hearing from the AMA
He will be playing 75% odd snaps by week 3
He will be riding the ring bear into the ceremony 
He will have to cast a wider net if he wants to get a laugh 
He will know only Drake Maye as a perennial super bowl MVP so not too much different in our childhoods
He will lead us like he led the fantasy league 
He will never got in that 
He will not be monied. He is going into fellowship and will have a fascist landlord
He will not break into my starting roster but I like stirring the groupme
He will save us from Kraft and deliver us to the promise land 
He will somehow wind up on the Yankees
He will still eat 4 of them in a day 
He won in 1938. Stalin in 1939
He won't answer
He won't answer for 3 days though, he's too busy fisting
He won't be a rookie next year, so he won't be good 
He won't be part of the intelligentsia when he falls, hits his head, has an intracranial hemorrhage, requires craniotomy, is in a coma for months, and lives the rest of his life (if he lives) with a seizure disorder.
He won't do it because he's a pussy
He won't even know there's a super bowl party going on 
He won't get 5 snaps let alone 5 carries 
He won't see your message for another three weeks 
He won't. When he plays, he will suck and Shaw will start 
He works at GE. They make computers that talk to engines. Hopefully he's smart enough to figure it out 
He would have still gotten rocked by the Humber Bumbler in the 🐐tournament 
He would probably be the most likely to complain about a meal at a restaurant 
He wouldn't fit. He ain't biting knee caps 
He wouldn't have gotten hurt if he didn't look like a bumble bee #onlyfacts
He*
He/she crashed into a forklift, didn't get very far 
He/she will choose his/her gender when he/she is ready 
He’d be an idiot, but he could do it 
He’d have his own bathroom. IDIOT 
He’s a dude, so 
He’s a man. 
He’s a snake oil salesman but the world has known that since he was first brought to the spotlight in 2015
He’s a triplet and the girl in the show preview is his sister. After BC, he come at as bi (although might just be gay) and had previously been dating a guy for a while (not that there’s anything wrong with that) but for some probably intentional reason, that significant other is not on the show preview and instead he’s doing the show with his sister 
He’s actually your secondary legal representative 
He’s bad at his job 
He’s been talking to marcus a lot apparently 
He’s being a little bitch and can’t stay healthy 
He’s busy sliding in Alison’s DMs
He’s can’t let London make that catch
He’s dead to me
He’s expensive this year. Gets more expensive next few years 
He’s fine 
He’s fine now, but backing up Fleming and Solder as the swing tackle 
He’s given you the answer twice in the last 24 hours in the GroupMe 
He’s going to force a trade to the Knicks because he’s a ego maniac and wants the narrative of winning in NYC
He’s going to fucking blow it
He’s going to get cut or traded when a team suffers an injury 
He’s immunized 
He’s in here more than @The Big Dick Bandit 
He’s literally sitting on our lineman 
He’s not even awake to defend himself. Nice. 
He’s not going to beat Goody. Might as well just give up 
He’s not going to post anything because he doesn’t follow through on his promises 
He’s not the guy
He’s out of bounds
He’s probably just chain smoking and smacking drives in front of an Iraqi cart girl 
He’s probably just sad that I didn’t reach out to him when I went to Philadelphia in May
He’s probably not even thinking about bombs flying over his head as the region undergoes further death and chaos 
He’s really dumb. For real. 
He’s so far gone. So sad
He’s your boy, boy. 
Head and neck anatomy, neuroscience, psychology 
Head of the Supreme Court isn't a cabinet position. How can you guarantee that a justice will step down during our administration? 
Heading Ian Eagle on the telecast today is the worst news I've had all week 
Headline is literally all you need
Headlines I didn't expect to be trending on Twitter today: Is math racist? 
Heads up football 
Heads up, got stuck in traffic. Aiming for 730
HEADSET ISSUE, PATRIOTS TO LOSE DRAFT PICKS 
Health Funk, that's not a name I've heard in a while 
Healthcare bill vote delayed 
Heard CAB fucked up mudstock this year 
Heard she's a Bills fan and you'd have to go to Jacksonville to visit her family if you dated her
Heard Sony MX3s are better but they are just as/more expensive
Hearing a rumor that Fogo de (Dr.) Chao is opening in the Burlington mall 
Hearing Dan Hanzus say "Joff" has now made my life complete
Hearing poll numbers gives me nightmares
Hearing Rand Paul is one of them. Probably also Murkowski and Collins 
Hearing that you're watching the Grammy's really makes me realize how much you really fucking suck 
Hearing*
Heath Evans
Heating for the building. Our unit heat is not included
He'd absolutely be the one dissent that causes the jury to have to deliberate for 17 days
He'd get beat up and lose his lunch money 
He'd get more attention if he played for a big market team 
He'd have to know how sex works fist before he could know about how to make twins 
He'd probably do it just because I'm a pats fan 
He'd probably still be too cheap to buy his own fruity pebbles 
He'd rather spend his time reading articles on football leagues that don't matter
He'd want that all for himself
He'd*

Heh, Bocker has a guy with a shaft and balls inside of him 
Heh, boobie

Heh. Joe said handy. Haha
Heh. Strokes...handy.... Nice
Heh. You said erect. 
Hejshsjfjajfjsbd
Hekker has also attempted throws on fake punts 19 times in his career, including now 5 times this season
Hekker is a good punter 
Held far too many severed penes and tested today. 
Held*
He'll be back. Less than a year. Book it. 
He'll be fucking someone else in six months. Book it 
He'll be suspended for the year, reinstated next year, still be on the chiefs, and everyone will forget about it in 1-2 years unless he does something stupid again, and then every armchair gm will claim that the chiefs are some malicious organization out to ruin the lives of women everywhere and they should have cut ties with the first offense 
He'll cement his legacy when he doesn't win a championship this year and leaves Cleveland 
He'll get his turn. 
He'll go mid second round to the chargers, end the season with 684 yards on the ground, 421 yards receiving, and 3 touchdowns. 
Hell goody is (not) applying to grad schools right now and he still talks to us!
He'll graduate from grad school any day now
He'll make less money but at least he'll play for a good team 
He'll never know. You're in the clear 
Hell no. 
He'll only get two games if he admits he was wrong and says he's sorry to Goodell 
He'll probably end up pulling a Hamilton anyway
He'll probably get notified today of punishment, have an appeal hearing Wednesday, and have the appeal decision made on Thursday 
Hell, why do we let the NHL get away with calling themselves that?

Hello there Fuckholes. I wanted to share some news with you all. If you recall, I had previously mentioned Olivia and my friend who was waiting for a heart transplant. Several of you donated to his family, thank you so much for doing so. He received a donor heart today and is doing wonderfully. Because of the Fuckhole's support, his family was able to be with him through the whole ordeal. Fuckholes 🐐

Help see me through this jordan. I need your encouraging words 
Help us John! What's the answer!
Help us Mike McCann. You're our only hope. 
Helps if that running back is built more like an offensive lineman than an actual running back 
Helps to have pretty much perfect scenery to capture 
Helps to have the leadership of Chuck Person 
Helps when you throw your hot dog on the ground and have to make your dad buy you another one 
Hendrickson is elite. 
Henry married my chemistry teachers (I think) niece. Close family member, just not sure exactly what the relationship is 
Henry needs to go. His time has run out 
Her
Her ability will even out my inability 
Her account was probably hacked
Her actual words will be "oh my god andrewww" 
Her argument was that important jobs get paid more because of inherent risk and extensive schooling
Her bf was not there 
Her dad was an oil tycoon, if that helps 
Her desire to drive lost our 
Her firm inspected the big dig tunnels after the ceiling collapsed and killed people 
Her friend started a photography business a year or two ago and is still working to get clients, so we had her do our engagement photos on Saturday as an audition for doing our wedding. She's only sent us ~10 or so so far but they have come out pretty good
Her husband was
Her IG is private. Boooo
Her insta is private. I do not have Facebook any longer, so cannot search for her there
Her insta post was from Brandeis. I googled her name and Brandeis. Turns out she's an admissions counselor
Her life will be confined to her bedroom with nothing to eat with 
Her personality**
Her porch is my porch 
Her real last name is Katie Yevochixjdj or something 
Her sister is one of the bridesmaids in the wedding. Friends with the bride 
Her track page says she was class of 2018 from AHS
Her voice is good, but I would never choose to listen to her music. I do think shes very egotistical 
Her voice sounds hotter than she is 
Herb
Herb and Hurts were both in 2020.  Up until this year, only one FLB was named per draft class 
Herbert can't get any help. 
Herbert gunna Herb 
Herbert is literally murdering people
Herbert is so shook
Herbert played like shit by my god, have some stones to run it down their throat 
Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! 
Herd immunity is a real thing. There are people walking around every day who cannot get vaccinated themselves and rely on others to get vaccinated to reduce the transmission of diseases.

Here are parking lots. T is right across the street. Street parking on any of the roads leading into or out of the square 
Here are the faces of everyone arrested for civil disobedience for blocking traffic in central square this morning

Here's the picture to make it easier. 
Herpes 
He's 100% going to kill you
He's 1-22 this year. Coaches aren't as important in basketball as other sports, but if nothing else it speaks to his inability to coach or motivate his team. I am 100% on board with the fact that you can only do so much with a shitty, unmotivated team, but you have to be really bad at your job to lose as much as the 76ers do 
He's 38$ next year 
He's 70+ so I would say no 
He's a bitch ass motherfucker who is too much of a pussy to try and win on his own so he's tryna suck Bron Bron's dick to get a ring
He's a bum. Mookie should get all of his money 
He's a dick muncher 
He's a ding dong. He should get his shit together and not act like Brett Farvre 
He's a fantastic player and I would never harbor any ill will against him. 
He's a free agent but he is coveted by several teams. They just don't want to pay what he's demanding. 
He's a good friend and I enjoy his dialogue.
He's a heavy favorite because you locked it up yesterday
He's a liar. That's this weekend 
He's a little whiny bitch. Whined his ass off when Kelly Olynyk purposely pulled his arm out of his socket. Suck it up. A little dislocation never hurt anyone 
He's a man of all people
He's a New York fan (sort of). He doesn't know the difference goody 
He's a pretty big deal.
He's a runner at that point. Stupid
He's a sleeper for this tournament. Just you wait. 
He's a true leader of men but he's not a net positive on defense over Bill and has not shown that he can assemble a staff to provide an offensive advantage
He's a weird guy 
He's abysmal 
He's actually a Cow, I Herd (sic). Haha
He's actually hoping you forgot 
HES ALIVE 
He's alright in my book 
He's also a lot slower relative to the competition than he was in college. When he runs, it looks like he's in quicksand 
He's also a main character in Wayne's World, which is equally as prolific and groundbreaking for the film industry 
He's also a racist who is personally funding Trump's loan by embezzling TBC funds into Trump's Bible sales endeavor
He's also due 9 million next year. Rawls has played better than lynch and makes like 525k. Who knows if lynch plays for Seahawks again 
He's also facing a lot of pressure to close restaurants again. He said today that he isn't doing that yet, but I will be unsurprised if it happens by next week. Our cases and hospitalizations do not look good 
He's also not an employee 
He's also not better at leadership. He has thrown his players under the bus after every loss 
He's also on the Athletic Football Show episode that dropped this morning 
He's also since left TD 
He's also smart sexy
He's also v good af at making money
He's also working with walk on freshmen and back up running backs. Not that that can completely absolve him of guilt, but he doesn't exactly have a Tim tebow playmaker 
He's an American hero 
He's an army veteran steel working Democrat with a much better mustache than you'll ever have 
He's an eagles fan when he's not being a bills fan because Erin is a bills fan 
He's an Elway or a Marino. Man, imagine betting against him 
He's an idiot 
He's an MD, JD according to his bio
He's anti establishment, just like you 
He's anti-app, just like he's anti-vax 
He's appealing, because it sounds like the NFL skipped the 10 game suspension, which is supposed to be the next tier. But either way, he's out for at least 10 games 
He's arguing for school choice and charter schools. He's arguing against left-leaning revisionist history 
He's as entitled as Jackson Mahomes
He's autistic for a reason 
He's back in. Made a nice catch downfield and got helmet to helmet-ed on the way down and his head whiplashed against the turf. Apparently he passed concussion protocol because he came back in on the next drive
He's back.
He's banging mad broads while his sister is at the conference 
He's become a big whiny bitch. It ain't you against the world, Russ, stop saying you don't care about your teammates and pass the damn ball. 
He's been alternating in and out every drive 
He's been asleep for four hours now
He's been frustrated with them all season. They didn't work (along with headsets) on Sunday. Im pretty sure Brady and McDaniels just went back to reviewing paper photos 
He's been held to <15 points in 3 of the last 4 weeks 
He's been lost to TikTok and shitting on sidewalks 
He's been lying about being your friend since 2006
He's been nothing but a true friend, a companion, a muse, a confidant, a pillow talking buddy, and a fellow fan the of Patriots 
He's been saying for weeks that forte's best option might be an incentive-laden deal with the pats. Gives him best chance to win 
He's been suspiciously absent today
He's been the poles 
He's been trained well
He's been typing for a long time
He's been v bad
He's boring to watch. 
He's busy trying to figure out which ice cream flavor he should infuse into his coffee 
He's calling a game tomorrow 
he's capable of
He's carpooling with Darrow 
He's certainly from a different generation, and I can't name a lot of his songs, but his work influenced so many other artists of our time. And if you look at his IMDB page, his music has been featured in a billion movies. 
He's certainly not at work 
He's certainly worth a roster spot this late in the season. 
He's clearly drunk 
He's complaining about being a backup and said he wants to go to a different team if it continues
He's dead
He's dead
He's dead. Just let him go
He's dealing with a high ankle sprain. He played last week, reinjured it in the game, and then came back and played through it. He's hampered but probably will keep playing 
He's definitely consistent. 
He's definitely going to miss 
He's definitely going to the exempt list if he's signed
He's definitely lined up as right tackle 
He's definitely out 
He's deflecting 
He's desensitized from spending so much time with you senior year 
He's doing nothing to incite violence. He's talking angrily at them. Their responsibility at that point is to redirect him away without assaulting him 
He's down 
He's earned it.
He's easy to spot. He's the guy not doing anything
He's essentially only been a blocker on any route that wasn't a short cross or a curl
He's finally dead. 
He's fine 
He's first in the power rankings isn't he? Higher numbers are better right?
He's from melrose 
He's fucked up. That's a neck injury 
He's getting interviews but a lot of executive pundits are speculating that he still won't land anywhere 
He's getting paid via grant funding. His checks aren't coming from the hospital so he's being dramatic 
He's given a red carpet to act how he wants without any consequences
He's giving Americans exactly what they want - to not have to watch basketball 
He's going to BC STM for grad school, so that explains why his suggestions are super tame
He's going to fuck so many 20 year olds. It's gonna be sick
He's going to get the 22 hat for sure
He's going to have to open the GroupMe and read this first 
He's going to leave 
He's going to pretend that his Groupme wasn't working and he can't see any of the messages
He's going to protect the women tho 
He's gone
He's good at movies
He's got a point
He's got it here. I can feel it 
He's gunna get benched for reaching for the pylon though. BB hates that 
He's gunna get crushed by John. Not a great look
He's gutta get that Facebook live stream going 
He's gutta throw that one away 
He's had a few underthrown balls. Wonder if it's the cold 
He's had his name changed for almost a month. That's practically squatters' rights. It's his name now 
He's hated his job for months yet has not returned to us. I have no hope 
He's he dude at umass med right? Or at least he was when he won 
He's in 
He's in 
He's in a meeting now. He doesn't know yet but we could be taken up by one of the companies that bought a share in the assets ge was selling off 
He's in Sweden now 
He's in the air when he throws it. 
He's injured now, what difference does it make 
He's insufferable 
He's just a coordinator, thus available per Joseph
He's just missing military service and he'd check every box 
He's just not a good player. As evidenced by him being out of the league for 4 years 
He's killing the bc post-graduation employment rate 
He's leagues ahead in picking up tires and putting them down. Doesn't really equal being physically fit 
He's like a foot taller than either of his parents 
He's literally a registered Democrat 
He's literally surrounded by haters
He's literally the definition of an average quarterback 
He's literally the worst employee I've ever been in charge of 
He's looking for himself, Angela, and you @Master Darrowball 
He's lost me
He's mad because you guys ruined his 🐐 bracket 
He's making a joke because he went to private school
He's mentally cracking already
He's more dead to me now than when he wouldn't be my roommate 
He's more graceful than a gazelle 
He's more likely to post if one of the girls mentions him in the other groupme. Don't think we don't notice Marcus/Devin
HE'S MY BOY
He's my RB 
He's not allowed to be there while the play is live 
He's not around to shit on 
He's not as cool as Darrowball 
He's not as good as he thinks 
He's not as skilled as Kovin. Washed.
He's not coming back 
He's not even a surgeon! He's an EM doc who has done a resuscitation fellowship and is doing a trauma critical care fellowship. He doesn't do any surgery despite wanting to pretend he is 
He's not even good at golf
He's not even that good 
He's not going to get a good score 
He's not in the GroupMe. How do I talk to him? 
He's not letting us out of our lease until it sells/ends anyway so the plan to move out early is dead in the water
He's not on my roster anymore now
He's not skimming. I'm confused
He's not taking that away from me 
He's not the only one who says Republican in here 
He's not top 5
He's not warming anymore 
He's not worth that money, right?
He's not worth that much 
He's not wrong tho
He's not. Bono, the Moroccan goalie is the best player 
He's not. That's why he got a news article written about him and his party
He's officially a minority owner
He's old now. He could sling it in 2007 
He's older than 15 now too
He's older than me 
He's on Joe's team?
He's on the sideline with his helmet on now so I don't think it's that bad
He's on your bench 
He's one of the Bernie supporters that refuses to vote 
He's only played two games so far. I would be surprised if he earned your intense fandom prior to week three
He's openly complaining that he deserves it because his team has more wins than OKC 
He's out for the rest of the season 
He's owed a lot of money. 0% chance he gets cut 
He's paid a salary. I have to pay back loans with interest. Nice narrative though 
He's paying for the whole Vegas trip. Shame you're not coming.
He's pretty easy to forget about 
He's pretty good. 
He's probably a really nice person 
He's probably been asleep for three hours by now 
He's probably been Facebook messaging them all for weeks
He's probably getting his big blue couch in the sky fucked right now 
He's probably going to get laid because of that, too. Super gay. 
He's probably manly enough to down a smirnoff ice in one go
He's probably not ready to see his first peen 
He's probably right
He's probably the closest 
He's probably the comment with the lowest karma in that thread
He's probably too busy watching one of the many movies he gets with his premium cable package to answer 
He's probably too drunk to function already 
He's purposely skimming but unintentionally being an idiot
He's rather go on vacation with his girlfriend than attend to important league matters 
He's ready.
He's real bad
He's real big on clan activities
He's really setting Herbert up to fail 
He's really the best and handing it off
He's really watching the WNBA instead of the NFL 
He's referencing the strategy used to get Olivia out of the house to surprise her with a proposal 
He's replacing Carr 
He's reversed a lot of environmental regulations and gotten his nomination onto the Supreme Court. Military has broader discretion for attacks against isis. 
He's right
He's right goody, I think bocker should be 3 and I should be 4 
He's running to the right. Who is there to stop him if he keeps running 
He's saying I an guilty 
He's scored a few times but he's no Johnny Hockey. I don't follow the team too closely but I haven't heard much about him since earlier in the season 
He's secretary of being a bitch 
He's short
He's showing off that he's a better friend because he remembers random facts about your brother 
He's showing that Manchin still appears to not support additional payouts based on the rising national debt, which will make Bock Boi said that he doesn't get more moneyz
He's sitting close to the edge of that counter and doesn't have a helmet on 
He's so bad
He's so dumb for posting it
He's so fat 
He's so predictable. It's the worst
He's so punchable 
He's sobbing on the field. 
He's started 7 games in those 8 seasons 
He's started cultural and fantasy football revolutions 
He's still in our friend group? 
He's still trying to get his head around the fact that the field gets rolled out before every Cardinals game
He's such a hack
He's such a piece of shit
He's telling me that he isn't accepting the apple from the Bible as the correct answer
He's the #1 home run hittingest catcher, isn't he? That's a record 
He's the 37th ranked RB in fantasy. Ideally Jordan would have two better RBs to play come playoff time
He's the best at calling for the snap that I've ever seen 
He's the hero we don't need but definitely deserve
He's the hero we need in society 
He's the only one I probably will drop at some point
He's the only one who came to play 
He's the other article I was talking about from that Michael J. Gerhardt guy. I don't know his qualifications other than being a legal scholar, but he testified before Congress at the last impeachment so he's good for something I guess
He's the real leader in here 
He's the reason the pats will never pick a running back before the third round ever again 
He's the underachievers. That's what his team is supposed to do 
He's too busy deciding to move in with me to answer you 
He's too busy on TikTok
He's trade raping himself! 
He's trolling right? He has to be trolling?
He's tswifts ex boyfriend. They dated for 6 years and definitely have never been seen together ever 
He's two left of the center 
He's under contract. He doesn't have a say where he goes. 
He's undoubtedly a much better Marcus than our Marcus. 
He's unfortunately fine
He's upset that I posted his WordPress
He's usually righty but sometimes he switched to the left hand 
He's waiting until March 1st
He's watching the line until his dad makes him millions
He's with the Chiefs 
He's worse in every facet of the game 
He's worse than JJ Watt 
He's your burden now

Hey @The Big Dick Bandit I’m happy you’re able to watch the game. You’re a true fan. Unlike that person who already went to bed. 
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit I'm just wondering, did you happen to just have explosive diarrhea? 
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit please call @#JustFacts✅ an idiot and say that he’s wrong 
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit what's you're excuse for the t today? Disabled train at Braintree. I've been physically on a train for twenty minutes and have only made it from MGH to Kendall.

Hey @The Big Dick Bandit, you're a good human being 
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit. Isn't jordan a Cavs fan now that the warriors lost to Cleveland in game four? Sucks that his team lost in the finals two years in a row 
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit. Remember that time that Aaron Hernandez was alive. Good times am I right?
Hey @The Big Dick Bandit. You know what’s interesting, healthcare follows free market principals. Can’t you choose to pay more or less based on how much coverage you want. Are your insurance costs decreasing now that there is a free market with plenty of competition?

Hey Darrow, can't wait to doom joe and the jordan to the posa and narrowly escape with you

Hey goody, just so you're aware, not sure if you've checked or not, but there was no stat correction in your game. You still lost. 
Hey Goody, shut up 
Hey goody. 
Hey goody. In my stock game, I invested in emc. Up 4.28%
Hey guys member when we used to shit on Joe Bourque for keeping Bortles. Member?!
Hey guys! Make sure you eat six servings of carbs a day! You won't be able to use all of the excess glucose though, so your body will over produce insulin and eventually turn you into a diabetic and can lead to heart disease
Hey guys, I finished at 6-8! Woooo!
Hey guys, remember when I won the survivor pool? 
Hey guys. Do you want to go find every person who is still protesting in Boston and murder them 
Hey guys. I've been feeling a little bummed about myself. The past week I over indulged in sweets and alcohols due to birthday stuff and going away last weekend. I've decided to embark on a weeklong consciousness exercise to find sources of unhealthy sugars in my diet

Hey Jordan, what three states have you lived in your whole life? 
Hey Jordan, your 49ers are making really stellar examples of themselves. 
Hey Jordan, your whole team literally retired to not have to play for your organization. I'll take accusations of stolen play books by butt hurt 3rd stringers and random sweeps of my locker room any day 
Hey Jordan. Miss you buddy

Hey man, that word ain't cool
Hey man, that's basically my home state you're talking about
Hey man. BC and BU are on the same green line. Easy to get two massively different schools confused. 
Hey Marcus stick to the current conversation topic 
Hey Marcus, go easy on me buddy. I have a family 
Hey my kicker made an XP today
Hey now, building a wall puts lots of Americans to work and stimulates the economy 
Hey Pin-Ball Wizard 
Hey Ryan 
Hey Ryan 
Hey Ryan 
Hey Ryan, don't you have Prescott?
Hey Ryan, why don't you abandon this little joke of yours and drop Ryan tannehill for me 
Hey Ryan. Thanks for all you do for the groupme, like kicking the shit out of Becker when we needed it most 
Hey Skimmer 
Hey Skimmer 
Hey Skimmer we haven't heard from you in a while. Hopefully you're doing well, brother.
Hey that last one is me! 
Hey there are still some douchenuts that suckle at his teats at every chance they have 
Hey Thielen, maybe you should worry about catching the ball instead of chiding the second best coach in the history of football.
Hey Tony, I would like to request, on behalf of myself and no one else, that you consider providing Bocker with $5 via his Venmo account. I miss his presence in the GroupMe. I would ask Jordan, but I think he is less likely to budge on the issue
Hey Trent Brown, maybe block a body instead of standing there 
Hey wait a minute, bocker didn't write any even though he promised them!
Hey who can honestly tell the difference in the dark 
HEY YOU LEAVE BOKER ALONE
Hey! The packers actually know how to run a legal pick play! 
Hey, at least we have a first down already 
Hey, be nice Darrow. I'm sure that 1 hour flight to DC is really exhausting.
Hey, do you guys remember last week when a bunch of sources said that the NFL was going to release psi data? Turns out that they never kept any of the records. Go figure!
Hey, don’t be mean to my roommate
Hey, good to see the US going in the right direction! 
Hey, goody's cat picture and my cat picture are the same. 
Hey, he worked like part time for like 6 weeks 
Hey, I ordered a foot x-ray and consulted Ortho for the possible fracture. I am running the show here 
Hey, i won't be mad if you guys show up 
Hey, I would have only lost to two teams this week. I don't think that's ever happened
Hey, if we won the fight, at least he's won something this year 
Hey, Marcus is a juggernaut compared to me 
Hey, none of those were me 
Hey, slow metabolism is an epidemic affecting at least two of us in the GroupMe
Hey, that's my birthday 
Hey, that's where I live now!
Hey, the lions have an ex-Pats executive as their GM now. They aren't allowed to suck anymore 
Hey, well, fuck you 
Hey. Can you remind me how the Pats did today? 
HEY. Goody was the LAST one to wish him that
Hey. I have never picked up less than a wr3 on the depth chart 
Hey. I only struck out on like 60% of my at bats. 35% were walks. 5% were HBP
Hey. One of us told Morcus to go to the ED right away 
HEY. Please be supportive of my good friend Joe
HEY. Please don't discount my neighbors PTSD because you think 'rona is fake 
Hey. You're a great person and I appreciate our friendship. 
Hey@#JustFacts✅ 
Hey@BC Football is going 11-1 
Hey@Benevolent Dictator of a Pound Town  you know Taysom Hill isn't a starting QB right?
Hey@Bo Jerk  how do I turn an mp4 into a gif?
hey@Daz 4 HOF 
hey@Daz 4 Prez 
hey@Joe Bourque . yesterday most of the Fuckswoles went for a run. What did you do with your life?
Hey@JustFacts✅ 
Hey@Ryan Darrow . We support you and are always here for you. You're a great friend and I would do anything to help you out if you ever "go through some shit" again. Just say the words.

Hide it under your bed from everyone else in your apartment. That always ends well 
Hideous 
High
High and dry is too dry for my taste. I far prefer safety meeting 
High and dry isn't a bad choice, just not one I would make given the options presented 
High and dry. That’s my least favorite of the three haha 
HIGH AND TIGHT 
High glycemic index bro 
High hit?????
High key
High school QB standout JBoss would have never
High schoolers and Morcus 
High top fade with a hard part and go fuck yourself 
Higher 
Higher ceiling* 
Higher education is a scam for poors who think they can climb the social ladder with a degree. Graduate degrees are useless and anyone studying to get one is a loser and a fraud
Higher level positions work 15 days a quarter. 
Highest %?
Highest paid OL in history 
Highest: Cowboys, Steelers
Highlights from 2019, before the league got big. Back when the athletes were in it for the love the game, not for the money 
Highline is cool until you realize you're already at the end and you didn't enjoy it at all because you spent the whole time pushing your way through crowd of slow tourists and ethnic families with annoying children 
Highline park 
Hightower and browner both saved the super bowl with plays that no one really recognizes 
Hightower and butler are not at the top because Hightower can be tagged and Butler is a RFA so he can be tendered with a first round pick 
Hightower has been calling the defense since mayo went down. Chung called them last year 
Hightower is also hurt 
Hightower looks like he is in on every play. He's swarming 
Hightower needed to catch that 
Hightower out. Knee
Hightower, Roberts, van noy, that dude we picked up last year that was good, flowers 
Hightower's in 
Hijacker*
Hike in Zion
Hike that. Bring hiking boots. 
Hikes*
Hiking right now. Will get back to you when home 
Hilarious that Jerry Jones is making it seem like this is Micah’s fault for using an agent 
Hill had to stop. Better throw and it's a touchdown 
Hill is going to get 4 kick return touchdowns tonight 
Hill with fingertips to knock that 
Hillary
Hillary Clinton, Francis Underwood, Prince, BUSTER POSEY, Ed, Edd, and Eddy, Riley Reid, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Lil Nas X, and Cyrus Jones 
Hillary is destroying marriages, confirmed. 
Hillary just bungled this campaign 
Hillary pays you to pull votes from Bernie #Votegazi
Hilliman*
Hillman had a great 2.8 YPC average against a MAC front 7. Feeling real good about that 
Hillman is out with a broken foot 
Hill's DV incident is the reason why I traded him away. 
Hillside sandwiches >>>>>>>>>> eagles nest
Hilo medical center
HiLOL 
Hiltop was the best part of my childhood. <10 minutes from my house 
Him and Bucci are the only two people I tolerated. And Skip for his pro-Brady rants 
Him and Paris McAdam 
Him liking random comments doesn't mean he's back. He still hasn't posted anything. 
Him? Learning? Can't be 
Hinch was really in a pinch
Hint 2, it was in 1968
Hint 3, it was only one game
Hint that the first one was released in 1991 
Hint, it is not in New England
Hint: he included college football intbia 
Hint: investor was not an athlete 
Hint: this player formally played for a team that clinched an AFC playoff birth this year (player has not been on the team for many years) 
HIPAA*
HIPAA*
HIPAA* 
HIPAA* @Bo Jerk 
HIPPA doesn’t exist 
Hire Rick Pitino
His agent should have been there making sure he didn't answer those kinds of questions 
His ankle is probably hurting him. 
His balls were small so he too hcg
His BMI is 37.2
His brother still lives there, I was good friends with his kids growing up. Used to play hockey with them. His other brother played minor league hockey. They introduced me to Ray Bourque a few times 
His character in Parks and Rec is literally the worst in the show 
His conviction got overturned
"His defense won 0.5 SB
Rex Grossman lost 1.0 SB"
His effect on my team has greatly strained our roommate relationship. I almost never even see him anymore 
His fault for choosing to be a white male /s
His favorite Boston gangster was from winter hill 
His favorite rap group is the sugar hill gang 
His first paycheck will come 13 years after I collected my first paycheck
His foot is sideways 
His grandfather probably died or something 
His grandmother was a Savarino, born in the same area as my family in Sicily
His head might explode
His heart isn't in the groupme. I think we have to off him now, Old Yeller style 
His job was to photoshop for the Fuckholes. He's neglecting very vital responsibilities because of his "feelings."
His kicker could recover onside then fumble 
His left foot was moving. That wasn't a charge. 
His long on the day is 68. This is like the fourth I've seen bounce inside the 5
His lover will just let it happen too
His mom likely cares 
His mom taught him not to play with his food 
His mom was director of admissions at UMass Med 
His mother had cancer and dementia and he was her care giver for months. He had a lot of time to process and say goodbye and her passing was very peaceful, pain free, and surrounded by family at home. The whole family got a chance to say bye. It was as good of a death as you could hope for. And his father is improving so things are okay. 
His name is Jeffrey Epstein and he is a doctor in Lakeland, FL
His name is Kovin 
His name is Nacho 
His name is Robert Paulson 
His name should be Channe Frank 
His name was Griffin
His net worth is only $4m which is not even enough to feed s family 
His next move will be to break his phone and tell everyone that the NFL gave him permission 
His number is hanging from the rafters of the Garden. 
His number of unread text messages 
His parents set him up for failure by spelling Zack the wrong way
His penis is an innie
His performance is still better than your attempt to taunt me
His press conference, his private consultation with the president, and his unwillingness to testify this week. 
His qualm is that he's going to be really full
His rankings were terrible all year
His Ray Lewis dance is better than Ray Lewis's Ray Lewis dance 
His receiver screws up at the goal line, his defense can't get a stop, his special teams can't recover a simple onsides kick 
His religious reformation really detracted from growing his rap career
His run defense got worse as the year went on top 
His secret Santa should stay with him tonight
His short game is not looking good. You guys are in good shape for next week 
His social development may be stunted by then 
His speech (granted just a speech written by a paid writer) last night seemed to edge towards rationality. 
His staff had to pull him aside to confirm he was fired. It was only after that happened that the letter from trump was delivered to the FBI headquarters in DC
His stint as Red Sox right fielder was less successful 
His strip steak video is also exquisite. 
His super bowl mvp trophy*
His tagline for the team was #WhyNotMinot
His teeth are bad
His thumb is there but so is his penis
His value should remain +$10 from whatever you drafted him for 
His virginity?
His Wikipedia says he's accused of protecting those who participated in child sex abuse which is not sick if true
His work on the goal line is the only reason I kept him in my lineup the last two weeks 
His*
Historically, how many basketball programs have given themselves the death penalty to avoid subjecting their fans to some of the worst basketball they will ever see? Asking for a friend...
Historically, the chances that it would have ended some other way are higher than him actually getting the no-no
Hit Flowers in the hands, should have had it. No excuse. 
Hit his hands, gutta catch that
Hit me
HIT ME WITH THE ANTI MASK PIC
Hit me with the joff bball gif 
Hit me with those promo codes

Hm ✍️✍️✍️
Hm further away than I thought when I saw it live
Hm. James Cook. Overshadowed superstar. 
Hmm I had no idea that was a thing. Thanks goody 
Hmm ok
Hmm severe red line delays again. Good thing I'm not leaving work for two hours 
Hmm some people are incredibly quiet in response to the allegations of blackballing me from all intramural and club sports teams 
Hmm you say this like it's a negative. Doesn't bode well for your membership in a certain GroupMe
Hmm, must be the better phone system being better again 
Hmm. Interesting. Wonder what JJ's father is doing during a pandemic where 4,000 people are dying every day
Hmmm
Hmmm are any of the CSOM majors here in grad school (the ultimate marker of Fuckhole success)?
Hmmm. Our Joseph works for a company where he quite literally acquires assets....maybe a move back to stamvegas is in the cards...
Hmmmmm
hmmmmm

Hockenson was my pipe dream 
Hockey fights are so lame nowadays
Hogan

Hogan :(
Hogan is probably safe because his contract was front loaded to prevent the bills from matching the offer sheet. 
Hogan scored more yards last night than he did his entire collegiate career 
Hogan was a good singing.

Hold up. Am I a skimmer or did we really not talk about Nick Saban hiring Steve Sarkisian as the next Bama OC?
Hold up. Guys, we were completely wrong about the Joe/Kovin trade. Goody, please retroactively put Bortles on Kovin's team and into his starting lineup
Hold your horses, buddy. You're still going to just be a fellow

Honest question (not trying to be a dick if he has sucked), how has that rugby guy been doing, Jordan?
Honest question coming up: didn't Nike drop tiger after his whole mishap 
Honest question for@Marcus Bauer @Skimmer  and@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  if he doesn't die. Is it illegal to sell access to the president?
Honest question, because I think it gets a lot in this election. What is rubio's stance on gay rights, minority rights, and women's rights issues? Not nearly as conservative as Cruz I presume?
Honest question, is this Hillary's oversight or is this the fault of having bad advisors 
Honest question, was Yao Ming actually talented? I just remember thinking that he was just really tall and could only play near the basket 
Honest question: am I missing anything by never being to a borough other than Manhattan?
Honestly believe that Brady will get injured before he has the chance to become "in-elite"
Honestly can’t tell if you’re joking or not 
Honestly completely surprised that the Cowboys didn't pick him up when they cut Randle 
Honestly couldn't imagine
Honestly don't remember a specific reason. I was dealing with anxiety stuff on and off through most of college so probably related to that
Honestly haven’t been on Reddit. Texans were the last expansion franchise 
Honestly I am dealing with it just fine. I feel like everyone around me at the hospital is trying to make me feel more nervous than I am 
Honestly I am unsure how he even got that job. He fills in for OC in Bama for one game, loses the national championship, then gets poached by the falcons?
Honestly i would feel bad for Larry Fitzgerald if he didn't make the decision to stay in Arizona instead of coming to the Patriots 
Honestly I would have taken a flyer on him for a 6th 
Honestly if I’m the colts, I just cut Luck right now 
Honestly if they can't keep themselves healthy, do we need to keep them around? Think of the cost savings on our healthcare expenses 
Honestly lots of betas in this season 
Honestly my biggest beef is Geno Auriemma's crusade to get everyone to recognize how amazing his team is and how great of a record it is. No one cares bro 
Honestly surprised those modern artists are already this high 
Honestly that generation deserves to be left out of everything anyway 
Honestly that tracks 
Honestly the Giants should have just given up on Jones and gone in on Rodgers. 
Honestly though, we just got to this point on the road and all of a sudden there was a table with a dozen rifles on it. Was pretty surprising 
Honestly, 25 hours without a bathroom break or food is impressive, no matter what the context is 
Honestly, as long as he doesn't have another chance, I have to be happy with how this game played out fantasy wise 
Honestly, can any of us?
Honestly, everything can go except star wars original trilogy, the main Harry Potter movies, and all Bond movies
Honestly, I am just finding excuses to say "OUR league" as much as possible 
Honestly, I don't know who is worse right now. Bocker or Marcus? 
Honestly, I’d be sad to not see me too
Honestly, I’d love to go back to Disney now that I can enjoy adult beverages 
Honestly, if I didn't have 4000 points by now, I would drive to NJ and cut off both of my big toes in front of Angela's apartment as an offering in exchange for her forgiveness
Honestly, it's completely dependent on the resident on service. There are some plastics residents that are impossible to deal with. Last year was worse, but Ortho can be a challenge. Surgery is always collegial but they take like 4 hours to see and staff a patient. Same with Neuro, their service is so fucked and it could be 8 hours before they see the patient
Honestly, Jordan you were my first thought. After Darrow of course.
Honestly, kinda what she gets for going to Florida 
Honestly, Morcus's body is impressive in this picture. Lean as fuck 
Honestly, most of what I did actually in LA proper wasn’t that fun. I liked the Tar Pits but there wasn’t much to see. I echo Santa Monica. 
Honestly, only a few reviews and a couple are kind of sketch. Are you just listing random restaurants in Cambridge?
Honestly, v strange seeing people's faces again 
Honestly, you shouldn't have told us until the day before the race 
Honestly, your risk for food poisoning probably didn't increase much after leaving it out all night. I've heard some horror stories
Honestly, you're pretty dumb. People our age do die from the flu. And even if you don't die from the flu, if you don't get vaccinated and then spread the flu to someone else, you're an asshole.
Honey badger released 
Honey nut (heh) Cheerios, Cinnamon Chex.

Honorable mention: during the annual Patriots Super Bowl parade 
Honored and uncomfortable
Honored to have the J. Francis seal of approval
Hooch is craaaazy
Hooper with literally the first play on have seen him make all year
HoopKid92
Hoopkid's afraid to leave his Hoop
Hooray! Not racist!
Hop off the bandwagon, Jordan. If you weren't a chargers fan because of Danny Woodhead, then you aren't a real fan 
Hope Angela doesn't have any rope lying around
Hope everyone is spending today jerking it to news articles from 10 years ago today when the world decided that Brady was washed

Hope you're enjoying your birthday party in Las Vegas. Sorry I couldn't make it 
Hope you're having a good weekend, Chan 
Hope you're having a great late morning
Hope you're well today
Hopefully Cole crosten. Not because he's a key player but because he sucks and shouldn't have even seen the field on defense yesterday
Hopefully deleting and reinstalling will work
Hopefully he shares with Gonzo
Hopefully ISIS doesn't have access to Reddit 
Hopefully Joe didn't need his retirement fund
Hopefully John Henry can buy another sports franchise with the money he saved
Hopefully Jordan doesn't see that for a few days....
Hopefully Morcus is still alive. Kovin's first statement was correct. Fish bones are sharp and can cause perforation and need to be removed if they are stuck 
Hopefully no one tells Liz T who owns GroupMe, which she uses on her (probably) iphone owned by a small boutique firm building computers out of a garage 
Hopefully North Korea doesn't delete the message
Hopefully only @Boe Jourque would take that comment as fact
Hopefully that doesn’t make me a heathen 
Hopefully that means it's not that serious if they aren't ruling him out right away 
Hopefully the new vaccine scheduling system works better than the previous system 
Hopefully there is more snow that weekend than there was this past weekend 
Hopefully there isn't a hooker in the passenger seat 
Hopefully they still show it at his HoF induction. Can't let a flag ruin such a great okay 
Hopefully we can all agree that Boundin' is the best Pixar short of all time, though
Hopefully within the week. But UVM is paying for a rental car and hotel from 12/4-12/6 for my final interviews with them 
Hopefully yes. Probably not
Hopefully you don’t want to go into peds 
Hopefully you get a good engine doctor to take care of Betsy after you have shat on doctors consistently
Hoping the union invests in ChipoleAway
Hoping to attract a bear to maul @Joey Brackets 
Hordord, KD, Boogie. Unbeatable 
Horford should get viciously attacked more often
Horrendous schools. Have you seen our mayor? 
Horrible decision. 
Horrible job only getting two stars Joseph. 
HORRIBLE play call 
Horse collar and a facemask on one tackle. 
"Horse collar tackle: penalty
Directly pull on the neck: not a penalty "
Horse collar????
Horses gunna win. Book it. 
Hospital employee parking lot 
Hospitalizations down 4 days in a row
Hospitalizations. Down. 3 days
Hospitals are working to test locally but that requires a) more test kits available b) approval from the state
hospitals can, but EMS won't know
Hospitals eat a lot of costs for the care they provide and for the research they run, especially when study recruitment goals aren't meant or clinical requirements (such as limiting readmission rates) aren't covered 
Hospitals lose a lot of money because they don't get reimbursed for 100% of the cost of a procedure. They have to pay for trained staff, and their is always competition among hospitals so they have to pay competitive salaries. They have to pay for accreditation. They have to pay gigantic utility bills, drug costs, research costs.

Hot take: the one foot rule is the best rule in college football

However I am choosing to spin it and ignore your proper logic 
However I am not a coward and will not delete my message 
However I would appreciate you passing along some video of the slug
However if Frank does want to come, I'm down to clown 
However my weight has been going the other way so I have more work to do than you 
However PA’s Supreme Court just threw out the state’s congressional district map and rewrote them, so this district as it is formed won’t exist when this seat is up for election again in November

However, I would prefer @Skimmer and his NBA talk 
However, if this were the Fuckswoles, you'd be a fat piece of shit 
However, if you are an anesthesia doc who starts his or her own pain cliiic and you just do fancy nerve blocks all day, you can make a shit ton 
However, if you need to vent or talk to someone, could you wait until after I take my exam on Friday and after I get back from California? 
However, if you want rational, this definitely is the wrong place 
However, it was the Congressional BASEBALL Game 
However, my official statement is that he can come see me in my office and we will charge his insurance company a good amount to treat his self-hatred and depression.
However, my work doesn't have terrible toilet paper so I end up doing most of my boom booms in the office. Also nature calls around 10 am for me anyway 
However, obviously anything I read or say doesn't matter until I experience things more over the next two years 
However, the Reproductive Fuckholee GroupMe would like to remind everyone that they are welcome to join, as soon as they meet our membership requirements 
However, the tournament concluding in Boston is good for the country, and thus good for the world  
However, very good at drinking cider

https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.92.6.1006 - Police officers were compared with community members in terms of the speed and accuracy with which they made simulated decisions to shoot (or not shoot) Black and White targets. Both samples exhibited robust racial bias in response speed. Officers outperformed community members on a number of measures, including overall speed and accuracy. Moreover, although community respondents set the decision criterion lower for Black targets than for White targets (indicating bias), police officers did not. The authors suggest that training may not affect the speed with which stereotype-incongruent targets are processed but that it does affect the ultimate decision (particularly the placement of the decision criterion). Findings from a study in which a college sample received training support this conclusion.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000992 - We meta-analyzed 42 studies, investigating five operationalizations of shooter biases (reaction time with/without a gun, false alarms, shooting sensitivity, and shooting threshold) and relevant moderators (e.g., racial prejudice, state level gun laws). Our results indicated that relative to White targets, participants were quicker to shoot armed Black targets (dav = −.13, 95% CI [−.19, −.06]), slower to not shoot unarmed Black targets (dav = .11, 95% CI [.05, .18), and more likely to have a liberal shooting threshold for Black targets (dav = −.19, 95% CI [−.37, −.01]). In addition, we found that in states with permissive (vs. restrictive) gun laws, the false alarm rate for shooting Black targets was higher and the shooting threshold for shooting Black targets was lower than for White targets.

Huh, 61 in 9 holes JBoss? That seems like a score that respectable golfers hit in 18 holes. 
Huh, I think you're right 
Huh, seems like in the same tweet, she was both recognizing her reliance on government assistance while also saying that people shouldn't have access to government assistance
Huh, so it seems like when the market tanks, the better bet is to hope for recovery instead of betting on the market to get worse

Hypothetical question. If I were to drop out of the league now, would I get the posa renamed after me?
Hypothetically 
Hypothetically, it's air circulation. Infectious is based on how many particles of the virus you encounter. There is some unknown number that you need to be infected with before the virus is able to take hold and spread within your body. Outside, air is naturally circulating and blowing particles in all different directions, reducing the likelihood that you may encounter enough to become infected. That's why it's pretty safe to be outside and away from other people. When you are bunched up together in a protest, the risk of infection certainly increases. In a stadium, even with normal outside air circulation, you're going to end up with the virus if the person next to you is sick and expelling droplets. Airplanes and hospital ventilation systems just recirculate used air. Meaning if there is covid in the ventilation system, it's just going to be spread around. That's why I'm hospitals, they have to create negative pressure rooms/units specifically for infectious diseases that spread by

I 100% agree that your last statement is correct. The only point I was trying to make is that the ideal time to stave off disease progression is in the outpatient setting. If you are telling patients not to come to the hospital until they are having trouble breathing, they won't get remdesivir until they have already had a progression of symptoms. I hope it significantly cuts down vent usage once they get admitted, but an oral drug that can be given earlier on would have a larger effect than an IV medication.
I 100% am fine with people accepting their own risks and playing/coaching. Again, I am 100% fine with having a season. All I am saying is that it isn't guaranteed that the season will happen because of all the things that go wrong.
I 100% am for that penalty
I 100% disagree.
I 100% hope it happens because I think that gives us the best chance to have JFF in the NFL for years to come. 
I 100% think amateur figure skaters should wear helmets. I would be willing to bet that the rate of traumatic brain injury in gymnastics is far lower than either skateboarding or figure skating 
I 100% think that that opinion is selfish. It's the exact same concept of herd immunity. There are people who rely on society as a whole to help them stay healthy 
I 100% thought it was a throwaway 
I absolutely could not imagine that
I accept these terms.
I accepted
I accidentally a word
I actively wanted the Patriots to cut him for 19 years. Year 1 was a honeymoon period
I actually am texting goody directly, like you asked me to do 
I actually asked him his preferred pronouns. We're boiz
I actually came to murder bocker
I actually didn't know til know that there were two different people 
I actually didn't wait for anyone to respond before I booked it 
I actually dislike the command center 
I actually don't know. That might give me some hope 
I actually don't love seeing that 
I actually don't mind EM overnights, but ICU overnights are doo doo butter 
I actually don't necessarily disagree with marcus 
I actually don't read. I just looked at the pictures 
I actually don't. But all that shit gets xposted to r/ems so I see it there 
I actually figured we could just hop into your spare bedroom. Then you could watch my dogs whenever you wanted 
I actually followed the red sox all season but not having nesn precludes me from watching them 
I actually forgot he wasn't here 
I actually had no evidence before but surely this helps my cause 
I actually have gone to the gym fairly regularly for the last three and half months 
I actually have had chipotle twice in the last four months. I am breaking the addiction. And I'm eating dairy again 
I actually have papers to grade goody. Do you want to do them for me? 
I actually have stopped listening to anyone of the episodes besides the Sunday flagship show because I feel like the whole show has lost chemistry, especially with Chris still out 
I actually haven't found a really good healthcare podcast. I listen to one called two docs talk that will eventually talk about the law, but it's pretty boring. I'm really just waiting for NPR politics to report on the law so I know at what things I should be outraged
I actually infected a chipotle worker so they contaminated all of the food hoping that Jamie would eat there this weekend. Trying to make sure he lost his matchup this week 
I actually joined a traveling bluegrass band 
I actually just hate you in particular 
I actually just want to not see you 
I actually just went to Instagram to make sure I didn't miss a JBoss engagement drop so I didn't pay attention to the end of the game. I assume the good guys won
I actually LOVE dots. I realize I am in the minority
I actually posted that screenshot without evening considering that he existed
I actually saw the ref flip the coin to tails after it had already landed on the ground 
I actually somehow don't have his number. Can someone text him? I just don't want to leave him out if he wants to come 
I actually support this. Basketball has too many time outs 
I actually teach med students how to counsel patients on gun safety, so I am a good pick for this
I actually think Jameis has done s good job transitioning to a leader in the NFL this year. Glad to see he's stopped acting like a child 
I actually thought it was you when I looked really quickly. But after like a third of a second I figured out it definitely wasn't 
I actually thought that I hated coconut until I had real coconut in Costa Rica. Then I just realized that I hate the shaved coconut shit that they sell in the US 
I actually used an OTC ear wax softener last night because I had build up in one ear. I think it helped 
I actually wanted the Patriots but was told that was against the rules
I actually went out of my way to plug in my laptop to put it on the TV
I actually work mostly from my apartment
I added Devin because he asked to be here and I enjoyed his company. If that warrants castration, then do be it
I added extra just to spite you 
I added him back because he came to my birthday dinner 
I added sriracha for some extra flavor since I flavored my ground turkey with Mexican spices 
I additionally don't believe that I have ever lost a piece of mail
I admire your dedication to the groupme 
I admit that there are likely many iconic institutions that were not included in this list. I didn't put much thought into it when making it
I admit they probably won't sell out, but you're literally giving up your ability to put yourself in the spotlight and allowing other teams to take over. 
I admit when I'm wrong, and it looks like I'm wrong. The fuckholes were right. Reports of torn acl for Lewis. 
I advise everyone to avoid Shelbie's insta story. It captures part of a vicious assault on an infant. It's hard to watch, for sure. 
I affirm that you are a genius 
I again would ask the court to strike all comments from Mr. Goodwin from the record, as he already rested his case. 
I agree
I agree
I agree
I agree 
I agree 
I agree 
I agree for written rules, but I don't think you can say that two people refusing to do the punishment was a product of the rule not being in some league-wide document somewhere. We all knew the punishment. One person took a hiatus from the league, rather than taking the SATs. The second just hasn't taken it. As one of the only two people to actually complete the punishment, I don
I agree in some cases it does 
I agree Morcus 
I agree that Clowney is not a good pro 
I agree that eligibility shouldn't be lost until you step foot on the field/court/ice during a regular or post season professional game. I especially hate that the current rules prevent someone who doesn't get drafted from returning to finish their eligibility 
I agree that I disagree with what I would enjoy when it comes to college football. I understand both of your opinions but just find joe more intelligent and better looking, so I’ll side with him 
I agree that is should be legal after a diagnosis of a terminal illness, psychiatric evaluation, and possibly sign off by a second, unaffiliated physician 
I agree that my roommate Kovin deserves two more wins. 
I agree that the more appropriate and rational argument would be "other countries are doing these things successfully, let's talk to them and see what aspects we can apply to our country to benefit the greater good."
I agree that your opinion is incorrect 
I agree to a point but there is a lot of evidence that they aren't approving legit refugee applications 
I agree with @Anthony Goodwin 
I agree with all of Goody’s stances, because I’m always #JustFacts✅
I agree with all of your sentiments about lacking motivation
I agree with almost all of her opinions and what she stands for. I agree she doesn't always have the best way of presenting her beliefs, but I 100% think that she gets a bad reputation because she's a woman who takes on a lot of fights in the senate 
I agree with anything that hurts Marcus 
I agree with becker about BB, but Johnny Dash is on my team this week, so I gutta support my guy. Fuck you becker, breaking bad sucked in season 1 (that hurt me to say) 
I agree with becker. If you win 5-0 or 1-0, you won the fucking game. The number of goals you score in one game shouldn't affect your strategy in the next game 
I agree with Bock Boi. He's irrelevant until he plays more than 60% of a season. Stop treating him like a star until then 
I agree with Bocker. I’d pick a feat that was more interesting 
I agree with bocker. You are giving yourself less time IF pats score 
I agree with everything Frankie said; I love my dog far more than I could ever love my child. Thanks for sharing that opinion Frankie
I agree with everything goody has said after reading the article. I will also add that the article misses a huge point: the author is seemingly normalizing police killings because white people also die from police shootings. Part of the BLM movement has been trying to reform police departments so police brutality and use of excess force does not happen to anyone, and the rates of people dying under police custody/by police during arrest attempts is proof that the system is completely broken
I agree with everything Joe says
I agree with goody 
I agree with Goody if he moves me up in the power rankings 
I agree with him on that too 
I agree with Joe 
I agree with John's choice of drugs 
I agree with Jordan. I probably would disagree with more Romney positions that I would agree with, but he is competent, articulate, and a reasonable person/politician. I appreciate him actually trying to govern
I agree with Joseph. Bocker really undermined the integrity of OUR league
I agree with Kovin. All this drama between all of your jobs makes me happy I'm not in business. 
I agree with Marcus 
I agree with Marcus's reading interpretation
I agree with Morcus 
I agree with most of Mr. Bourque's evaluations. However, I would like to state for the record that "too huskey for sandusky" is actually my group's trivia name and was not thought of or googled by me. In conclusion, I did not rip off the internet, but I ripped off my more creative friends who might have ripped off the internet. I rest my case and realize I am not better of a situation than before. 
I agree with Nick. I can't wait to be in school forever, only to have someone who isn't an MD yell at me for not seeing enough patients in a day
I agree with that 
I agree with that 
I agree with that 
I agree with that. This feels worse 
I agree with the comment but do not like the chiefs winning so cannot like
I agree with the disagree 
I agree with what you're getting at, that the NBA allows players to have a voice on social issues in other ways (immediate thought it warm up shirts). NFL players can't even wear the color cleats they want to wear, so I think this rule is seen as stifling the expression of NFL players
I agree with you 
I agree with you on Tamposi. And that video is from one of their Tuesday Twitter shows, which I now watch weekly to get my extra dose of the heroes
I agree, but don't come out and say that you're "moving forward with him" after he beats the chiefs if you really don't want him
I agree, but I don't think we can hypothetically claim that we should have won the game based on the performance we gave 
I agree, it is
I agree, Tony, but unfortunately that isn't the sentiment shared by most and it has become a politically charged issue
I agree, unfortunately cannot fix that
I agree. ESPN sucks. But just like their early reporting on deflategate, where they get their money will influence their reporting 
I agree. He's not rapey enough for BB 
I agree. I am assuming that it is probably due to supply and Baker prioritizing state-backed programs over healthcare sector programs
I agree. I smell a troll job
I agree. I think it would just be more fun to fuck around 
I agree. I thought maybe I was biased because I like crispier fries and fries with chili and cheese can be pretty soggy
I agree. I understand that family is important, but I can't understand why LaRoche is being a little bitch about it. You got to bring your kid to the clubhouse every day for a number of years. They asked you to cut back, it's not that absurd of a request. Just accept it and go back to making your millions of dollars 
I agree. I'm just stating that he's "allegedly" fine 
I agree. Should have gone for the dagger 
I agree. That sundae looks fucking good 
I agree. That's why I said super theoretical. It would take a lot to make it reality 
I agree. What a weird game. I need some more time to digest what happened after I watched the whole thing 
I agreed with Florida based on a political pundit. I acknowledge my mistake and seek forgiveness. 
I agreed with you. You said it wasn't a catch 
I ain't a bitch, I put him in his place 
I ain't fucking with that 
I ain't gunna pay to go lift at a gym when I have a climbing membership and have a free gym to use at school.
I ain't hating either 
I ain't no bitch. I don't skim
I ain't no critical care doctor
I ain't paying for that shit. Find someone to donate their time 
I ain't touching this
I almost commented on your face, but didn't want @emyrbot to catch any unnecessary shade 
I almost could have swatted it out from my couch 
I almost decided to go nap at halftime but Tom Brady wouldn't want me to 
I almost exclusively rent through enterprise and they email me the receipt before I'm even out of the drop off parking lot 
I almost have the first of five sands done on all three tables. Sanding is the worst 
I almost spit my drink out when Collinsworth said that sproles was a possible HoFer 
I almost vomited 
I already booked my flights
I already did
I already did that bish
I already did. I forced the league to be less competitive and focused on things I'm good at 
I already explained it 
I already forgot about FoGo 
I already had a devastating pumpkin carving injury. Can't afford another set back 
I already had this trip paid for 
I already have a new clan for us 
I already have my acceptance speech written 
I already have my MBA from that one management class in my MPH program 
I already invited everyone over for draft night since Joe and Jamie are incapable of getting a condo 
I already knew this
I already know it's going to happen
I already know obamacare is going to be fucked if republicans take office, but I would rather the presidency be about going forward and progressing with what we already have, rather than trying to tear down what we have already built/decided as a nation 
I already know that 
I already like tf out of you
I already made my Insta post. He can't not retire
I already made this joke 9 hours later 
I already miss Barry
I already read it hours ago 
I already rented a limo 
I already said Leonard 
I already said that 
I already said what teams have a chance in the GroupMe, so what I said is true 
I already spelled his name wrong for the benefit of the whole GroupMe 
I already voted. #VoteEarlyUntilYourCandidateDropsOutOfTheRaceBeforeVotingDay
I also admit that the orientation of those pictures is confusing
I also agree @Nick D won 
I also agree that I'd rather follow John's live, laugh, love IG than wear those shoes 
I also agree with Bock
I also agree, it is totally fucked up if she is lying and Brett's life gets fucked up. But this is why women don't report sexual assaults. It is immediately dismissed and they are ignored and often attacked.
I also am not in favor of taking the right to gun ownership away from people, but I am in favor of there being a stricter vetting process that is uniform across all states. I don't know enough about the current process, but in MA, we hear a lot about people going to NH fun shows and coming home with guns without much of a background check. If that truly is the case, I'd be for legislation that stops that. 
I also am the primary driver of apple picking adventures in my relationship. We all know my feelings towards apples (both the food and the tech products)
I also am very curious about the mermaid puss 
I also am very self conscious about working out in front of other people but fuck the haters 
I also assumed it was HIV but I guess TIL also
I also believe it. He should focus less on his State Farm commercials and more on buying uggs for his linemen 
I also blew up a pool for my child, but he is still scared of water 
I also cannot. I have class tonight 
I also chose the ravens week one 
I also debunked it
I also deleted Snap but would not put it past John to snap a pick of his bloody shit
I also did not live in a mod
I also didn't enjoy the documentary. I also cannot claim to have read more than 20 pages in that book 
I also didn't hear about the puss smashing story 
I also didn't like it probably because I fell asleep and missed 90% of the movie 
I also didn't use the car to get babka every week so I guess I got that going for me 
I also dislike nights in the B pod. So many social disasters
I also dislike our society's lack of emphasis on preventative healthcare 
I also do not 
I also do not agree with his, "well it wasn't a girl so it's fine" argument
I also do not believe that Rodgers is the problem. 
I also do not enjoy superhero movies. I thought Deadpool was good, but the last one I actually enjoyed was the Dark Knight
I also do not have a butterfree
I also do not know the answer
I also do not know what big container is 
I also do not recognize That's What You Get
I also do not think that Bocker's comment accurately portrayed Chan's opinion, but honesty doesn't sell tickets.
I also don't feel like the rent price concern is too valid. A common arguing point is that Boston loses all of its college grads who can't afford to live here. But college students are staying here in higher numbers than ever, probably secondary to more lucrative jobs (like ge) that pay higher salaries 
I also don't know and am too afraid to ask
I also don't know what a NH fun show is but if I had to guess, it would be pretty similar to a gun show 
I also don't like your beard Marcus. In my day, we shaved before we started to look homeless 
I also don't think a scenario with the question you just posed is anything like predicting market value of a company's stock prior to an IPO release, which is what I assume you do since you were all in on Snapface's launch 
I also enjoyed that episode 
I also failed
I also feel left out
I also finished my taxes and played fortnight. Bet that's not recommended either 
I also get insurance for free
I also get the day off 
I also got that recommendation
I also had experiences with Stephen wu that were similar to Jordan's. He added me on Facebook after he randomly just showed up wherever I was one night, uninvited, and proceeded to hang out for no reason. He then took my phone number off of my Facebook and spammed me with fb messages and texts about how he wanted to room with us, hang out all the time, and and join on trivia team. When I didn't respond, he would find me in person to ask why I wasn't responding to his messages 
I also had no idea 
I also had not heard this story 
I also had to look up what that word meant
I also hate him because he is a FLB
I also hate Marky Mark as well, too. 
I also hate the red line, which is where I assumed you were going. 
I also hated groupme and hated gifs 
I also have 4 focal bangers (heh) and 3 head(y) toppers (heh)
I also have a beige box. Camera was up 10 minutes ago when I checked last 
"I also have a bone to pick with Pin-Ball Wizard 's people and am taking my anger out on him. 

I had a patient come in with a classic story for a ruptured aneurysm. I wrote in my indication for the CTA ""family history of ruptured aneurysm, presenting with sudden onset worst headache of her life. Concern for SAH versus RCVS.""

Read comes back: ""no vascular abnormalities in the brain or neck"" 

My attending and I look at the scan and she has not one, but two aneurysms that the attending radiologist missed "
I also have a friend there today. B school and med school combine forces 
I also have a question to pose. Is anyone opposed to be substituting the sats for the acts? 
I also have Marcus added but can't see his story. The fucker blocked all of us 
I also have no clue what the picture was supposed to mean, but two people liked it so I felt stupid for admitting that
I also have no idea 
I also have not sent mine back 
I also have precheck, Joseph.
I also haven't spent more than a single day in any national park. Even the ones I have been to...I feel like I have barely seen anything there 
I also just use the BoA 123 
I also just wanted to imagine how Bourque dying 
I also know the answer 
I also like beer 
I also like rolos
I also like tits 
I also liked that comment specifically for HyBockricy
I also lost the election for NHS president so Vice President is probably right where I belong 
I also love @Ass Ketchum. I asked him to bring back Wednesday Frog and he delivered. The exact opposite of @Herky the (Women’s Basketball) Hawkeye 
I also love it. 
I also love Ricky and he has a big dick (those two things are unrelated) 
I also love Tom Brady 
I also melt and shoot that shit 
I also miss Kit Kat. Was never a huge Kit Kat fan til I couldn't eat them
I also never said he was bad. I said Mahomes would be fun to watch in this offense 
I also nominate my wife who has a medical exemption due to being pregnant 
I also only mildly enjoy cannoli (cannoli is actually plural you uncultured fucks). I would much rather choose some other type of pastry 
I also pee in the shower
I also play as Kirby
I also played catcher about 60% of the time
I also post Pats circlejerk material, which I would argue is critical to the survival of the groupme 
I also probably cannot
I also put in a waver claim for Gordon joe. If goody didn't get him, I was next in line. No chance you coulda gotten him 
I also really liked More Perfect, which was a Radiolab spin off about the supreme court 
I also refuse to answer any message in that GroupMe now 
I also replied 
I also rescind my add request 
I also run exclusively with headphones and if I don’t have them I will just refuse to run and go eat a gallon of chunky monkey instead 
I also saw knives out and i also enjoyed it and it was also the last movie I saw in theaters
I also saw that post 
I also see Joe as more of a Delonte West
I also skied my second and third glade ever
I also still don't know what the running man challenge is, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask 
I also still have power
I also think goody would perform excellently at all work responsibilities while maintaining positive, professional relationships throughout the company. 
I also think that we have talked about it in the GroupMe before 
I also think where it went out
I also thought he was last 
I also thought it required a closet. TIL
I also thought Nelson Agholor couldn't catch  
I also thought that student loan debt did not transfer 
I also thought the answer was going to be mike Babcock who I'm pretty sure is the red wings coach? 
I also thought the Pats post was weird 
I also thought you bled all over the bathroom. I did however wake up super stressed several times in the night to make sure you were still breathing 
I also too think he's down 
I also tried adding him to three other GroupMes and couldn't 
I also vote for twill. My heart pains me, but BB can't win this matchup. He has every 🐐 quality that I look for, except that he wasn't picked up for $51 when no one else bid on him 
I also want everyone to know that my next Patriots jersey will be a Develin
I also want to add that I understand the issue with Big Tech (trademarked to the Around the NFL) having control over political speech in general, and I think that probably fundamentally pokes a hole in my argument. I have yet to reconcile that in my head so I have no further argument other than to preemptively say that I'm probably wrong with whatever I think 
I also was not a fan 
I also watch a lot of the videos from the secret camera in Darrow’s room 
I also watched The Shrink Next Door which is will Ferrell and Paul Rudd
I also would choose neither 
I always am very surprised that Sanchez hasn't made his way there yet 
I always believed in him
I always care about whether your day is good or not
I always catch text that is inaccurate
I always cheer for the niners because jordan was always my friend. 
I always felt very oppressed in Melrose. The Whole Foods doesn't even carry fresh gluten-free bread. I have to buy the frozen stuff. What the shit is that?
I always forget that Giacamo's is in the north end. I think of the South End location. And now they opened in Melrose too 
I always forget that goody was pre med. Then he threw away any shred of decency he had left 
I always get problems with the arches of my feet because my shoes aren't fit well and I over pronate when I step. Some people get knee and muscle problems just because their shoes are a bad fit 
I always had faith in you, Andrew. 
I always hate having a mayor who personally smothers thousands of old ladies to death with a pillow 
I always hated Patterson
I always have chart review if you guys are bored!!
I always knew @Beanboy was raised in a proper town 
I ALWAYS KNEW HE COULD DO IT
I always knew Joe was an unamerican terrorist 
I always knew John and Bocker were my friends 
I always knew Kevin Thompson was a Russian name. 
I always knew Morcus was tied for the smartest member of the GroupMe
I always knew that we Dems could make it happen. Never had any doubt. Biggest win in decades. A true bell weather for how anti-trump/GOP this country is. Can’t wait for November when we take back the House. Pelosi’s gunna be back where she belongs and Paul Ryan is going to be left in the gutter somewhere in Madison. Impeach! Impeach! 
I always knew you could do it. How does LC feel about the move?
I always knew you were my best friend ever since after graduation
I always liked to think that Tonks was the most dtf of the wizarding world 
I ALWAYS LOVED PATTERSON
I always loved you, Marcus. 
I always make it rain
I always new Dion Lewis sucked. 
I always rooted for Tom Hanks in SPR 
I always said that Darrow was a kind and fair commissioner 
I always said that Jaylon Brown was my favorite Celtics player 
I always said that Jayson Tatum was the best player on the Celtics
I always said that Marcus Smart was the best player on the Celtics
I always said that the nfl would play a full season without any delays or cancellations
I always support you
I always supported this
I always think of hockey as the more dangerous sport for referees, but football is just as dangerous...
I always thought it was because of the ssri I am on. Never had the problem before 
I always thought that this was perfection 
I always thought you were supposed to push exclusively from your lower back 
I always thought, like what if you don't enter the draft after you graduate or leave school. Can you just sign with the team of your choice as a free agent or do you have to declare for the supplemental draft 
I always underestimate how much it makes and end up with enough for a week 
I always used a spiral notebook but can see the appeal of a 3 ring binder
I always want to fuck bocker 
I always want to know what he's going to say about the game today. What's he going to say about the game today? 
I always wear them on escalators though 
I always would have guessed that Kevin was the twin that fed off of joylessness 
I am #AntiUnpin but @#JustFacts✅ 
I am @Joe Bourque, not @Joe  Bourque 
I am 0% sad I didn't get invited. I was honestly just wondering how it was 
I am 0% surprised by that 
I am 100% being serious
I am 100% fine going to Joe's if people don't mind breaking up before 5. But also happy to have people here if people want to hang out longer. Parking is free
I am 100% for not voting for Warren 
I am 100% in on the Floor is Lava show on Netflix
I am 100% on board with never playing Sony Michel again
I am 100% serious and I don't wear n95s outside
I am 3-1
I am 75% of the way through the new Kid Cudi album and I firmly believe that it is trash
I am 75% sure that the answer is yes but I am checking with Olivia because she has a friend staying with us at some point this weekend. We also don't live in Boston anymore though 
I am 99% sure that Lianne is his sister 
I am a 4th down genius 
I am a bad comparison because Rhode island car insurance is one of the most expensive in the country 
I am a bad friend
I am a bad person.
I am a cat hater. I agree with Marc Sessler that you can’t trust any guy who owns a cat 
I am a certified dog lover. I humanize dogs. I would never try and marry a dog to another dog 
I am a fake fan of @Iowa Football is going 10-2 
I am a fan but I lack explicit knowledge of Harry Potter to consider myself balls deep 
I am a fan of GoToMeeting. Could have DareDorm up on the screen for everyone 
I am a fan of him 
I am a fantasy expert
I am a genius
I am a genius 
I am a good person 
I am a nervous pooper and I can only get through about half a cup of coffee before the bathroom calls my name. I also feel the need to poop after running but am fine during.
I am a particular fan of the birthday shots. 
I am a play and a half behind you guys. Just saw the pick 
I am a savant. I have risen to the status of immortality.
I am a star basketball player and a member of the intelligentsia. I have never lost a March Madness game
I am a very positive person 
I am about an hour away from starting day 1 of 2 of my last round of interviews at UVM. My first interview is at 930, and I have 9 interviews after that today. Then I have to go to a meet and greet where all the faculty and residents are invited at a cocktail bar. And then have to go to dinner with all of them at 8 pm. And then still have three more interviews tomorrow morning 
I am about an hour in. I am very entertained 
I am about to go al Davis on this league 
I am above no joke
I am absolutely dumbfounded at the fact that these people think that they are making a difference when they act this way. You can keep embarrassing yourself all you want, you won't recruit people to your cause 
I am afraid that Trump will win. But I am very cautiously optimistic that Biden will win. But I have been hurt before.
I am against the spying practices. However, I will say that I would be more open to it if there was evidence that what they do makes me safer. I haven't seen anything suggesting that, so it makes it a lot harder to stomach/justify 
I am agreeing that your statements sound correct
I am almost through first episode of season 3. Better than season 2 but definitely not as compelling, yet, as season 1
I am also back at square one
I am also conflicted. If Dr. Bock tests positive, I will consider myself a god for my abilities to predict the future, but it would kind of stink to have Dr. Bock die. 
I am also confused 
I am also getting very frustrated with my program. We have a new program director who tried to implement a change no one wanted, we told him we didn't want that, he did it anyway. Within 3 hours, he had gotten so many emails from residents and faculty that he had to scrap the idea. But they are still trying to put us in position to make money for the hospital without having a good learning experience 
I am also having trouble. I have green and yellow in two guesses but have been staring at the last 8 words trying to put them together 
I am also not doing a fellowship. All my homies don't do fellowships (except Kovin) 
I am also not free the following weekend 
I am also pro private entities banning conspiracy trash. If you are calling for an "all or none" response (and I apologize if I am misinterpreting, genuinely not trying to put words in your mouth), then I 110% support going all in 
I am also rooting for the Chargers to fuck the Chiefs and for Mahomes to throw six picks
I am also very surprised and sad to see that Mayo is being interviewed for the Eagles HC job. By all accounts, he is a riding star. I don't want to lose him like I lost Flores
I am always here to help the Bourques take money from the SAD LOSERS in the GroupMe
I am an Andes dude
I am an Italian from north shore Massachusetts. I am not Catholic. 
I am an octive threat
I am appalled and hurt that you don't remember 
I am asking you! You tell me!
I am assuming that Riverside is now Six Flags 
I am aware that I have not responded and I do not attend to 
I am bad and I should feel bad 
I am bad at golf
I am Bambi 
I am basically in B school now 
I am beginning to realize that everything I like about LA is outside of LA proper and true LA sucks dick
I am both PALS and NRP certified 
I AM BOYCOTTING HQ
I am by a window. You don't know me 
I am caught up
I am caught up 
I am caught up 
I am caught up 
I am certainly all ears for any power rankings discussion, though 
I am certainly going to need a reminder up until the hour before our reservation 
I am clearly not salty, because my finger slipped and accidentally removed you
I am complaining about kickers
I am completely in support of freedom of speech, as outlined by the first amendment. As I am sure you know, private companies like Twitter are not regulated under that amendment. If you want to make the argument that most of the information we consume and share occurs on social media platforms, that's fine, but removal of inflammatory content is still not the same as government censorship. I feel very strongly that any misinformation should be marked as such (just like claims of election fraud were marked as unreliable and disputed during this election). I don't see this as a slippery slope argument without any government involvement. I get that we probably fundamentally disagree with that. Also, even though I am very liberal, I still don't agree with every position the ACLU takes. 
I am concerned that Aaron Jones will be able to beat Kovin single-handedly this week
I am confident that whoever was in that OR is no longer living if KJU is actually near death 
I am confident that you do not know where I live
I am confused about this Mysterious Moses
I am convinced that Nick secretly lives in Brooklyn
I am cool with that 
I am curious as to what you noticed because I don't see anything too off 
I am currently having gas 
I am currently making dinner
I am currently making money
I am dead 
I am definitely underpaid 
I am disappointed in today, but I don't know why I expected anything different 
I am disappointed that Marcus took genuine interest in someone's day and was ignored. Not a good look for the rest of the GroupMe
I am disappointed that no one died in the hour I was at the gym 
I am disappointing Frankie today 
I am doing a project for a research class where I have to make a hypothetical budget for a hypothetical research project. Part of the budget includes salary and fringe benefits. The professor told us to estimate fringe benefits to include ~30% of salary, just to keep the numbers relatively simple. However, we also have to calculate % effort. If I have an employee who is only working 25% effort, do I report his fringe benefits to be 30% of his full salary or 30% of the salary covered by this project (using % effort)
I am doing Epic training for literally the 12th time
I am done with episode 2 of The White Lotus. I'm kind of disappointed that Iroh hasn't shown up 
I am down 
I am down for any post-dinner plans. Gutta stay on that healthy diet so Bocker doesn't call me out in the groupme again
I am down for having no kicker. And I would like to see another flex spot. No second quarter back. No ppr. I would be more for a defense getting a point for stopping an offense on fourth down than a quarterback losing points for a sack. 
I am down to vote for whichever side offers me the best player as a bribe 
I am dropping that link and then putting my phone away to go to class. I hope I incite chaos when I'm gone 
I am envious of the Chris Chan jersey collection
I am excited that the Mayor of Ding Dong city is now in the game
I am excited to test my (lack of) fantasy skill against your well constructed teams 
I am extremely confused 
I am fairly sure that he is in a non-heterosexual relationship. Not that there’s anything wrong with that 
I am far to poor to go anywhere out of the greater Boston area 
I am fine adding James to the league but I agree with Nock that I don't think he should be in the GroupMe
I am firmly with @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson for completely different reasons 
I am for substituting a kicker for a qb. I am still against changing the point values 
I am for the addition of punters to each team. Can we discuss that 
I am forgoing all future wins in protest of this sham league and it's shadow government 
I am free after 430
I am free Friday. I cannot Saturday until about 8 pm. I am free Sunday
I am free this weekend. Sunday evening works for me but the earlier the better 
I am genius
I am getting ads for Susan Collins and Sarah Gideon every fucking commercial break
I am getting blood drawn at MGH right now. They made me wait in one line at one of the labs. I got to the front, then they were like lol jk we are.sending you to the other lab, it's less busy. Get to the other lab, and there are 7 people in the waiting room. Had to wait in line to re-check in just to be put at the back of the line 
I am getting more and more convinced that @Skimmer  is actually dead
I am getting the same feeling 
I am getting them. You just suck 
I am glad my GroupMe post made the league change their mind 
I am glad our friends aren't part of that 80%
I am glad that Frankie is disparaging someone else's IG posts instead of just mine 
I am glad that other Fuckholes were able to contribute to my suggestion of You so I did not steer my good friend Bocker down the wrong path
I am glad this wasn't Ayal, because no way I could play Fortnight with him anymore
I am going to admit something that I am not proud of. I am listening to folklore right now for the first time. 
I am going to hold off on any more opinions on the matter, as I knocked half my food off of my plate while walking and typing that message. Obviously the gods are telling me that I am wrong
I am going to look at the reunion stuff with Olivia tonight and see what we want to sign up for 
I am going to make you wait
I am going to read all of the posts in this GroupMe right after I get back from driving off of the Tobin 
I am good for a nice poop 30-60 minutes after I started drinking my daily coffee, but it is always a 3 or 4 on the Bristol Stool Chart
I am guilty of that.
I am halfway through my 11 course, $69 tasting menu. So far, we are off to a very good start to things here in Philly 
I am happy for him but am sad that he's probably not going to get the playing time he hopes for given their current WR corps and the fact that they agreed to sign another one this morning
I am happy for you and LC, @AbadBot , but the GroupMe did not need another J. Francis
I am happy that bc has done something positive 
I am happy that the narrative no longer can be "joff never makes the playoffs or having a winning season" and now it's switched to "joff flops at the end of the season" 
I am happy that we still have a chance to make it to the playoffs but do not feel like we have a shot to win a game 
I am happy to see the positive news. Especially with other colleges having outbreaks
I am hearing a rumor that it is Patrick Surtain
I am hearing European chick and available for one night. I don't get what's wrong
I am hearing that it was more of Cam coming to the conclusion that his asking price was not going to materialize 
I am here early but they made a table for us outside. If we want to move inside we can 
I am here with Olivia but also here for a conference 
I am hiring a lawyer as we speak to press charges 
I am hoping for something original 
I am hoping to 
I am however considering getting a Meater 
I am however quite slow 
I am in a groupme with about 10 friends that is intermittently active. They hang out together a lot more than I hang out with them, but I talk with them at least once a month
I am in a zoom with Bobby Flay. I can die happy 
I am in agreement 
I am in Goody's minority 
I am in Maine for the day 
I am in no way insinuating that affluent minorities are barred from coming to BC because of their race. I'm trying to say that disadvantaged families have trouble affording BC tuition and race is a huge predictor of socioeconomic status. I'm saying that this is literally one piece to the problem of BC having a perceived deficit in diversity. I am in no way arguing against attracting any minority. I am 100% in favor of bringing in as diverse of a class as they can possibly get. I'm saying one of the many reasons it is less diverse is because a larger proportion of minorities are more disadvantaged by the higher tuition than white families. In fact, BC should be less cost prohibitive and more accessible to everyone, regardless of their income
I am in the 6 figure club. It just happens to all be debt 
I am in the middle of a Uworld qbank quiz and can't copy and paste but will post it here once done
I am in Vermont 
I am in Vermont, otherwise I would 
I am interested in neither. 
I am intoxicated 
I am irate. My good friend @Skimmer was invited to bowling but not to the party
I am Joff "Narrative" Savarino after all 
I am just getting home from an overnight so I have not seen my beautiful naked body yet 
I am just listening to my playlist now. Already added song #1 to my go-to playlist
I am just so confused how people can possibly think that the first part of that statement is true 
I am just waiting for him to either retire or rejoin the pats so it's once again acceptable for me to wear his jersey 
I am keyed in on the Sox from late March until the end of May, then back into it again in September
I am leaning towards thinking it was a cliche and not shade 
I am leaving the league, and I am not even the person to which Bocker is referring
I am liking it because I enjoy this job as a bridge, hopefully, into med school. If this job was my an entry level position in my field of study, I probably would be miserable and poor 
I am lit
I am literally perplexed that Hue still has a job
I am literally shaking with rage 
I am long gone. Sorry John 
I am making up for choosing not to complain yesterday by airing my grievances extra hard today 
I am more disturbed you enjoy getting fucked by a 63 year old with a strap on 
I am more of a cabbage cart guy
I am more privileged than 75% of people 
I am more than capable of competing in America 
I am much happier with what the rest of the update said 
I am never wrong 
I am nitpicking them.
I am no longer watching; Olivia had it on during dinner but I’m back doing work now. I heard Olivia yell “that’s bullshit,” so she was probably referring to that 
I am not
I am not 
I am not a big baller 
I am not a captain like @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco 
I am not a fan of either of those two things 
I am not a fan of them being that low 
I am not a farmer, so no
I am not a huge Witten fan but I don't think he's terrible. I like Tessitore as well. I really don't like when the guy who is on the field cart thing because he just kinda jumps in and it throws me off compared to how most crews use their sideline guys
I am not a medical trainer 
I am not a military man, but if I were, I would respect him more as a superior officer for effectively sacrificing his job to try and protect me
I am not a Rams fan by any means, but I always enjoy watching the Seahawks lose 
I am not a rat, so I hope no one else is
I am not a Yankees fan despite this experience 
I am not around 
I am not at work today, but am working on the residency schedule, a conference presentation, grocery shopping, and taking care of my dogs. And I work each of the next 4 days. I'm literally dying inside doing exactly what I signed up for 
I am not convinced that a federal holiday would be greatly beneficial but I absolutely do not agree that a "significant number of people would take a 4 day weekend." Most people in this country are not advantaged enough to do that. 
I am not cool enough to know what that acronym means 
I am not donating to Kristen's charity specifically because she cheated in trivia 
I am not emotionally involved in this enough to take the time to do that
I am not emotionally ready to point out the typo ^
I am not entertained
I am not free 
I am not free the following weekend and Bocker knows it. 
I am not going to click on a link in the GroupMe, but it would be nice if the Red Sox had a player like Mookie
I am not going to say that I secretly love this, but I'm not going to say that I don't love this 
I am not going to their house for a while
I am not in the league, but didn't Joe trade FOR Adams?
I am not mad at the CDC, just disappointed
I am not one to run and defend every word AOC says, I think a lot of times she thinks she is speaking eloquently while she ends up alienating people. This is one of the times where what she said made sense and was accurate. 
I am not panicking
I am not religious
I am not saying anything about the damn 67%....
I am not seeing any Seth Moulton on there 
I am not shocked. Trump's transition team was incompetent and essentially useless during his first presidency
I am not sure if that counts as a dish but I don't know enough about the thompson's thanksgiving to refute it 
I am not sure that @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson  knows who Mac Jones is
I am not sure you understand that I literally didn't have a RB to play in that spot
I am not surprised 
I am not the only one who noticed
I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord!
I am not very well 
I am not watching, but heard a rumor on weei that Chris Berman was not hosting this year. True or false?
I am noticing a theme....
I am now
I am now 100% on board with the theory that BB is calling plays without a play sheet.
I am now consistently hitting the ball to the white circle. I am a golf god 
I am now the proud owner of a hole in my arm
I am objectively jumbo 
I am obviously watching very intently 
I am of the belief that he is senile and is making up most of them  
I am of the belief that the Rams and Saints are much better than the Chiefs, despite the massive hype
I am of the believe that you must complete these challenges without the aid of anyone else. I believe that you are responsible for jerking yourself and no one else 
I am off to class but I appreciate the discussion this morning
I am offended on behalf of @Adam Chandler and half of @Fantasy Baseball Champion 
I am offended. We have done nothing but help you succeed. 
I am offering. Are you around tomorrow?
I am officially moved into Portland and I will never take AC for granted again 
I am officially opting out of the 2024 secret moses and will just be getting Joff a gift
I am older 
I am on a train 
I am on an admissions committee meeting and the first applicant of the day was born in 2000. Why are we so old.
I am on MassHealth. Has been fine for me except someone screwed up administratively and they refused to cover my prescription for a month. Got it all sorted out though.
I am on the record as not being an el pres fan but I may come around after he rescued Miss Peaches
I am on the t and can't see his touchdown, but I stand by my statement of his suckage
I am only a minute in and have seen too much Morcus @JustFacts✅ 
I am operating under the assumption that most of the looting and destruction is being done by non-protesters trying to stoke the flames (literally and figuratively) of chaos. I guess in that respect, you are 100% right, fuck those people.
I am optimistically putting my chances of winning at 3%
I am out
I am out if it is Foxwoods, in if it is the cape 
I am out on dinner
I am out on SC2. I find WZ much more fun and I am better at it, so I enjoy it more
I am out to eat for breakfast and I have terrible signal. I don't think my gifs are going through 
I am out. I don't usually listen to music when I workout
I am overworked and underpaid 
I am passionate about so many things 
I am physically ill
I am pleased with the outcome of the game. 
I am prepared to finalize my pick for Patriots preseason rookie of the year 
I am pretty sure @Beanboy invented the internet 
I am pretty sure Biden's press secretary is a grown up Ginny Weasley
I am pretty sure me liking Dots always makes Bocker physically ill
I am pretty sure that Joe is sleeping through the Patriots game
I am pretty sure that some people from Tufts were doing a triatholon someone down on the cape
I am pro .2 PPR
I am pro pressure washing in any situation
I am pro-anti-punishment
I am probably heading down soon. I'm not sure where I'll be but I want to end up at city hall, since it ends there and MGH is right down the street 
I am probably still going to wear one in the ED whenever I am around patients. The amount of times someone coughs in my face during a shift is astronomical
I am quite content with my method of travel 
I am quitting
I am reading that in actual practice, both are acceptable. Carry on
I am referring to Bocker's question about investing versus paying down loans 
I am registered independent but we all know how I vote 
I am replaying Halo 1. About to encounter The Flood for the first time. Shit is about to get real
I am reporting that the Lions are going to take Jalen Carter 
I am riding so high on the Jordanzer Express rn
I am right in Joe's boat. As much as it pains me to say, I 100% agree 
I am rooming with Olivia 
I am rooting for da nerrs
I am sad
I am sad
I am sad 
I am sad I went to bed at halftime last night. I heard I missed the best football game in NFL history
I am sad that my efforts to change your mind were in vein, but I appreciate your friendship and what you contributed to the league. I look forward to enjoying time with you and everyone else in this groupme as the snow melts and we can escape our icy prisons 
I am sad that Tom Brady has let it come to this. He could have retired as a Pat and cemented his legacy, instead he's just fighting to stay relevant. Shame, really.
I am sad Thomas left. If Thomas does really well, I will be even more sad. If Thomas struggles, I will feel a bit better that it wasn't with the Patriots.
I am sad we missed Clemson girl 
I am serious about Bronny tho,. Are teams going to draft him in the first round if he literally has already died once? Seems like a risk of draft capital just to sign the most overrated player in NBA history
I am shilling for Microsoft, as are you with your current level of participation in this GroupMe 
I am shocked 
I am shocked and appalled 
I am sick of this arguing. Can we go back to talking shit about each other
I am skeptical about Diggs 
I am skimming this 
I am so emotional right now. This is literally tearing me up inside. Watching 0 minutes of regular season play has tied me so closely with this team 
I am so emotionally devastated right now
I am so erect right now 
I am so fucking triggered right now 
I am so happy I have a great friend like Joe to support me 
I am so hard right now 
I am so out on Chappell Roan 
I am so sorry 
I am sorry for the grammar mistake 
I am sorry I wasn’t here to guess, Anthony. 
I am specifically tagging the two of you for no particular reason
I am standing up. So no.
I am still 0% convinced that Bocker has insurance rn
I am still blaming him since he brought it up despite it being Joe's fault 
I am still in the stands waiting for them to put the TD back on the board and waiting for them to throw a flag on the kickoff and waiting for them to throw a flag on either of the missed face masks on Mac.
I am still investigating why Hunter Henry's catch was ruled incomplete. 
I am still not used to working on football Sundays. I honestly forgot that games were on between when Joe asked earlier today and now 
I am struggling AND underprivileged
I am sure Angela would be happy to come to the draft and see Darrowball 
I am sure any biases were listed on the study limitations 
I am sure between the group of us we could collaborate to make a single team with a high probability to win 
I am sure he is a great, hardworking individual
I am sure I am probably the only one interested, but MA just launched a couple of cool tracking websites.
I am sure John will answer you any moment now
I am sure that 420.....69......1337 us Darrow's. Zero chance that he made that up. 100% real
I am sure that you showed the ladies how big of a turnout it was
I am sure you have the time 
I am sure you will find some good Caribbean doctors to help out
I am sure you're probably all set, but if you want recommendations, my brother went to SE Asia for his honeymoon a year and a half ago 
I am talking about the music performances. I just don't know how you say "Billie Eillish really represents LA and what we want the Olympics to embody" 
I am telling you, from my mouth, that my original reason for quitting was that I hated the keeper format, among other rules, that were in place. Enjoying football again was an added benefit. I will not be returning to the league, I am simply trying to bring light to the fact that every year you lose one or two players and never want to admit that the format of the league is the reason why.
I am thankful for @Prima and all of her hard work
I am the 2018 champion 
I am the 75%.
I am the best evaluator of all patriots players 
I am the deep state.
I am the definition of in shape
I am the most dedicated fan in this groupme
I am the most empathetic. I have the best empathy. Everyone says my empathy is the best. 
I am the only one who appreciates this genius joke 
I am the second highest in week one. Give me the championship belt please 
I am thinking sanders and lafell and burning the rest of my team. If anyone wants Russell Wilson, he is a keeper for 11 next year!!!!!
I am too uninformed about each candidate's platform, voting record, political experience, etc. to make a proper ranking at this time
I am torn on this issue. Criminals are still citizens and on one hand, they should still be entitled to the rights afforded to the rest of the population, including voting for who should represent them. That said, I can understand the argument that by being convicted of a crime, criminals have forfeited some of their rights and freedoms. I don't think I could make a strong commitment either way at this juncture, but I certainly 100% agree with Tony that voting rights should be restored after release from prison. I look forward to Marcus and Jordan arguing that ex-cons should not have the right to vote because more people voting is actually bad for politics
I am trying to broker a peace so I can hang out with my good friend Bock Boi again
I am unable 
I am unable to attend
I am unable to corroborate Bocker's claim that he's at work 
I am uncomfortable 
I am unfamiliar with that day 
I am unhappy that Joe won
I am unsure of my availability because of an upcoming exam. Definitely a better chance of being around Friday or Saturday night versus during the day 
I am unsure of the safety of the restaurant but I would be happy to hang out with you that weekend Bock
I am upset that Marcus (from the show, not our Morcus) wasted all those donuts. Morcus and I would have eaten them (if they were gluten free, of course)
I am using him as a vehicle to make fun of CSOM
I am v confused af
I am v sad. I was at work for the Pats game. I meant to record it to watch when I got home and realized that I forgot to actually record it 
I am vehemently opposed hanging the league for the sake of changing the league 
I am VERY against any investment in sports that detracts from the quality of life of every day students. If you get a 50m donation for a new facility, by all means build it, but don't leach from the experience of normal people who are actually paying money to go to BC instead of attending on athletic scholarships
I am very aroused
I am very confident that Kovin, Bocker, and I will all get infected at some point
I am very enthused to go to loco. Fuck the rest of them 
I am very excited. It was my third choice but honestly it is an incredible program. I am really really going to love it 
I am very happy that you have properly installed your rear-facing child seat in preparation for the arrival of JJ 
I am very lucky that every time I have had to move, it has been off season and I have a several week grace period to slowly move bit by bit. Don't know how you guys did it in one day.
I am very pro-Wegman's due to their large selection of gluten-free foods. A lot of the Wegman's brand stuff is Celiac-safe. In WF, a lot of their brand-name foods are processed with wheat and thus cannot eat them. MB is kind of right in the middle in terms of quantity of store brand gluten-free stuff
I am very selective of how and when I jerk and what I jerk to
I am very smart about the shooty hoops
I am very supportive of my friends. You just aren't one of them
I am waiting it with my sister in law, who is a vocal teacher. She was not impressed 
I am watching CNN. One of the senators that was going to challenge the results seems like he is not going to challenge anymore
I am working Labor Day
I am working on my wood 
I am zero percent motivated to study for my other three exams this week
I am zero percent plugged into the Red Sox except for what shows up on my Reddit home page but I embarrassingly had not heard of Brayan Bello until 30 minutes ago but I’m ready to buy so much of his stock
I am, in fact, going to study for the psych shelf. Just as I would study for any exam.
I am.not ashamed 
I amend my comment 
I amend my statement, she gave her shift to someone and is not working
I amend that. Invest in offensive line too 
I anchored the 4x100m that came in 11th in our division in the state my senior year 
I answered every question and filled three pages of the essay. I completed all requirements to the fantasy fuckholes league office and received confirmation upon completion of the exam that my punishment had been served. This line of question is a travesty and I will pursue all legal options protect my rights as a club manager 
I answered your question 
I apologize for misrepresenting what he said
I apologize for triggering your sensitive stomachs but if there is one thing this groupme stands for, its doing shit that makes everyone else uncomfortable, and I stand by my decision 
I apologize to all those who I harmed along my path to self-mutilation
I apologize to the whole GroupMe 
I apparently don't even get an invite to the wedding, as is tradition 
I applied to over two dozen scholarships. I tried, not my fault that they couldn't recognize greatness 
I appoint @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson  as my puppet figure head of government
I appreciate @Chank Hill  going out there and doing the research. His boots on the ground are vital to the functioning of this groupme
I appreciate all of your efforts, @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim, but how can we be sure that the president and CEO of GroupMe has not been compromised by the same hackers that took control of your account? 
I appreciate goody using person-first language to refer to people with celiac. Having an ADA-qualifying disease like MS, or cerebal palsy, or celiac can make you feel like less of a person sometimes and person first language helps destigmatize 
I appreciate how Jamie does not participate in the GroupMe but somehow is able to know when Kirk's name gets dropped
I appreciate it
I appreciate learning more about the issue. Thank you for the push back Jordan 
I appreciate seeing Joe's face frequently. Keep it coming. 
I appreciate that we have gotten off the subject of Antonio brown 
I appreciate that, kind sir. I will certainly be staring at that while I jack off tonight. 
I appreciate the compliment, Anthony, but we both know that isn’t true 
I appreciate the confidence in me joe 
I appreciate the explanation because it makes the joke funnier
I appreciate the invite but I've been told that I have to stay at home to expect the birth of a child
I appreciate the offer (and love the sales pitch to me) but am not sure that I'm going to even get out of work before 7 and I have dinner waiting for me at home. I'll see you Fuckholes tomorrow though 
I appreciate the offer but my grandmother would be unable to make it, so we have to go to her for dinner. 
I appreciate the offer, Anthony, but I'm weighing my options on how to get to the city when I go see Hamilton with Olivia's whole family. Unless you can house 7 people, I will likely be lodging elsewhere
I appreciate the optimism John 
I appreciate the praise, Bocker, but this is why he doesn't come around
I appreciate you always assessing the marketing’s impact on shareholder value tho 
I appreciate you keeping so current, as I just put my name down about 95 seconds ago 
I appreciate you responding but I know you'll be eating baguettes and drinking red wine or whatever French people do 
I appreciate your dedication
I appreciate your honesty 
I appreciate your input, Chan, and I will consider changing my strategy next week. 
I appreciate your kindness, but there have been several times where I have had to be steered back to #JustFacts✔️. I just am thankful that you and @Skimmer have always been there for me 
I appreciate your sacrifice
I appreciate your tactfulness in starting the conversation and then stepping back to let them go at it. 
I appreciate your use of the oxford comma
I appreciated your interest in the conversation, becker. You were always my friend. 
I approve that trade. Make it happen
I ask myself that every day 
I ask you to reconsider who you plan to elect. Think about the one true candidate. 
I asked @bockbot not @#JustFacts✅ 
I asked @jordanbot
I asked a girl in lab if I could see her uterus the other day. She consented happily. 
I asked about Alice's Restaurant because I listened to it every year with my dad but Olivia had never heard it 
I asked for this to happen the minute he retired. I am a savant 
I asked goody to do something about it 
I asked something similar yesterday and no one answered 
I asked them why they weren't flying charter 
I asked to be invited to that....
I asked to join. Plz accept 
I asked twice and the only response I got was that Bortles mortal combated the Steelers 
I asked two friends. They said no because it would require you to have their username and password. Also, pretty sure Bocker said you could use his version 
I asked why I can't be on Morcus's BC team 
I assume Apple is lower than Microsoft 
I assume by "saved a life" you mean you stayed out of the way and didn't actively kill someone, like you do every other day
I assume he'll have to get really drunk to hang out with us
I assume I will be sitting here by myself for the next 30 minutes since no one will show up on time, as is fuckhole tradition 
I assume it came out better than mine 
I assume it has some stupid cap implication 
I assume it’s just this guy proving the date of the actual game against the Monstars 
I assume it's Bill Barnwell who grades were shitty before this travesty 
I assume Morcus paid and is having all reimbursements sent to Bock as a transfer of money from rich to poor 
I assume no keepers, full ppr, 2 kickers per team
I assume Philippines since Jordan already guess that and I assume he wouldn't miss the thriller in Manila 
I assume that it is a Gandolf reference
I assume that means I'm not coming over to watch game 7
I assume that Mina is referring to Cam Newton and listing a bunch of different routes (hitch, flat, go, post). 
I assume that someone from the south is trying to be funny and reference my geographical upbringing 
I assume that you are referring to the Knicks beating the hawks 5-4 currently
I assume that you’re still trying to finish a 5 pound Hersheys bar from Christmas last year
I assume the justice department 
I assume the news breaking is that Morcus traveled and is now on a ventilator
I assume the same way as if they were enforcing a weather related travel ban. With cops and national guard redirecting people off the streets and stopping cars to make sure they are essential employees driving to/from work 
I assume the value of Greenland plummeted after Iceland displayed its superiority in the new hit feature film, Eurovision: The Story of Fire Saga
I assume they make money from the primetime ESPN game every year, plus they sell red bandana stuff in the bookstore. It's not the quantity, it's the message they'd send by pocketing any profits from his memory 
I assume this was his third touchdown of the game 
I assume we miss the extra point 
I assume you are asking how late I can stay out? I’d like to be heading home around 11, Olivia works the next day 
I assume you read Oliver as Olivia and in that case, don’t be such a fucking skimmer 
I assume you saw the report that Merkel had to explain the Geneva convention to trump on a recent phone call 
I assume you'll be transporting livestock for grazing purposes 
I assume you're going to Cracksonville?
I assume you're referring to the fact that if an announce sucks a players dick, metaphorically speaking, I immediately begin to hate that player
I assumed it was a glitch but it makes sense that it’s an update if it’s happening to everyone else 
I assumed that the tornado killed you
I assumed that's what he meant as well 
I at least have a little respect because who would want to associate anything with New Jersey 
I ate so much chipotle during college 
I basically have heard all of that from media outlets in which I have reasonable trust. I also have seen multiple sources saying that the officers were in plain clothes, and the boyfriend, who was licensed to have the firearm, claims that police never identified themselves as such.
I beat kovin with a 4gate stalker rush yesterday and then had a void ray "rush" going while teamed up with John against kovin during one of our wins today 
I beat you in round 1 of the consolation round last year 
I bed you put your thriller in her Manila
I beg to differ. I'm in the dead spot of Boston 
I beg to differ. I've been sneaking into your apartments and sleeping on your various couches for four years 
I believe @#JustFacts✅  and @Joff had that the Steelers didn't pass the smell test
I believe @Hoopkid92 OBGYN was @Matt Levine’s Parrot 
I believe @Skimmer and I corrected that narrative last night 
I believe 0% of that story 
I believe after 4 hours you are legally entitled to compensation
I believe at kovins around 5ish 
I believe Chan showed up closer to on time too in that situation 
I believe female. But I haven't read into it 
I believe haskins is sick. But it's a much better narrative if he's not 
I believe he is that same hypocrite 
I believe he was making a joke about AA
I believe heady topper still exists 
I believe he's in, but I only know that because I'm not a filthy skimmer
I believe I got flack for my anti Zion takes month ago before he proceeded to not play, proving me correct
I believe I had that 
I believe I have a strong case. This intern is certainly too developmentally disabled to practice medicine
I believe I just said that you had proved me wrong and I was grasping at straws?
I believe I said "Go BC" first 
I believe I specifically said that racism against blacks was to blame for systemic inequities suffered by the black community. They have been set up to fail. If you think that means that I don't think black people are capable of succeeding, then you are completely changing my words.
I believe I would be the most competent member of the GroupMe at running the GroupMe. 
I believe in @#JustFacts✅ 
I believe in Kamara
I believe in you Kevin. 
I believe it to be incorrect 
I believe it was with KD and Bocker's parents, IIRC, which I very well may be remembering incorrectly 
I believe Joff said to keep him in 
I believe Joseph was joking...
I believe Kanye flipped and is now the VP to someone else's presidential run on the california ballot 
I believe Marcus beat Joe once. 
I believe NY has talked about doing something similar with med students. Tufts has started to consider the idea but right now the preference is to have as few people in the hospitals as possible. 1) Reduces silent carrier risk. 2) Reduces exposure risk. 3) Conserves PPE for those who need it most.
I believe one of the barstool guys also hates her. Called her "Lebron with a microphone" 
I believe Pakistan and Syria are the two places affected, and maybe also India?
I believe people were arguing against Brady moving on because he wasn't a Fuckhole 🐐. Now Eli can move on even though he isn't a Fuckhole 🐐?! 
I believe someone pointed that out before but I'm just fully realizing it
I believe that @The Big Dick Bandit is pointing out that there was a clear decision made by the leader of the league. If you didn't agree with it, you should not have participated 
I believe that Bill is supposed to be a 4th year but had to take a year off for "rapey vibes" reasons?
I believe that championship is rightfully mine. I did so well during the year 
I believe that class difficulty is considered
I believe that everyone else's pick in the survivor pool is invalid because no one rhymed in their picks like goody and me 
I believe that he spells his name Morcus
I believe that he's "mega moneyed" after his boss sold the company. Buying a plane is, however, a mega rich move 
I believe that his original shirts sold out, but I think his clothing line from 2015 and 2016 isn't doing as well 
I believe that I have always been on the KO bandwagon 
I believe that I have effectively turned around my tendency to leave you off of lists 
I believe that I saw a Tweet saying that the Pats OLine finished without a single starter at their natural position
I believe that it was this gentleman 
I believe that Jordan has commissioner power
I believe that Jordan's throw should be separate to minimize the risk of hitting another tennis ball while traveling in the air. 
I believe that someone was your dad. And then me several times afterwards whenever I wanted to make fun of Joseph
I believe that story almost as much as I believe the threesome in Fulton story 
I believe that that skim qualifies John for a 25 draft dollar deduction 
I believe that that's grammatically correct. 
I believe that the correct term is OCR 
I believe that the first test that they run is a rapid test which has a higher false positive rate. They then retest the same sample with the more accurate, longer test AND they re swab the player to get another sample to run the test again 
I believe that this story has also been retold in the GroupMe on numerous occassions
I believe that Tyler Lockett belongs to me 
I believe that we will win 
I believe that's the decision that was reached
I believe the correct term is plumbing 
I believe the first few are entering phase I based on expedited drug approval from the FDA
I believe the ners are the worst team
I believe the pool went through the Super Bowl. 
I believe the rights to Gronk and Rodgers were left to me in chan's will  
I believe the term you're looking for is Fucknut 
I believe there was some vodka water thrown in there somewhere 
I believe they are normally visa, but mine is through an organization that my parents belong to as teachers, and it's a MasterCard 
I believe they cost a boatload more than even the expensive private programs in the US
I believe they had an offer for $700k but they wanted to close in September (this was back in February) and the landlord declined the offer
I believe they're talking about ownership swapping. 
I believe third date is when the fuckholes were supposed to meet this woman?
I believe this is the study in question if anyone is interested
I believe we confirmed that you were the nazi. 
I believe we discussed that novel on here prior to Jordan's time in the Fuckholes. 
I believe we had this discussion last year. Have to have a student ID and I've already used my one code and my friends who I asked last year don't want to give out their username and password 
I believe you mean bocker 
I believe you mean lewd 
I believe you started for my wood is plywood and were a three sport athlete 
I believe you're like 9 or 10 months early 
I believe you're mistaking me with Chan 
I benched once 
I bet Bock probably flew into Chicago and bought the ticket there. 
I bet Cali burritos are fucking amazing 
I bet Chris Chan would be incredible at this
I bet he prefers monument wings over gold fever wings
I bet he showed you how to use the Office suite of software 
I bet he would put the coke bottles back up just to take them down again 
I bet he's not scared of throwing axes with Joff
I bet he's planning another golf trip to San Francisco with Morcus right now 
I bet Howard gets another TD before the game is over 
I bet Kovin's car that Kristen sets a PR 
I bet Marcus whispers sweet nothings to you on your nightly phone chats while you eat a triple stack of warm toll house cookies
I bet Morcus thought the Titoons were a legit #1 seed last year too. His ability to evaluate football teams is unparalleled 
I bet that there will be at least one post in the GroupMe regarding golf tomorrow
I bet they don't even have a golf simulator
I bet we can use "come play close to greatness" when we recruit 
I bet you want to fuck his asshoke 
I bet you were on the edge of your seat 
I bet you wouldn't even tell me the diagnosis from this x-ray from the other day 
I better stop point shaving then 
I better tell Angela so she can dump your ass and go back to getting deep dicked by Darrow 
I blame @M. Stribling Bauer 
I blame being awake all night 
I blame Bocker 
I blame my lower posts count on all of the lame bball talk 
I blame my team's collapse on Kevin's power rankings. If he just put me at 7 where I belonged, this wouldn't be as disappointing 
I blame Obama 
I blame TikTok
I blame traffic, or parking, or something 
I blatantly ignored it because of the fact is says parody in the name...
I booked Olivia and me for 4-5 pm
I bought my tickets to the Super Bowl this year when Maye was drafted 
I bought the Leesa (one of the competitors to Casper). Not disappointed 
I briefly did not BOlieve
I bring lunch every day 
I broke my rule because Anthony said it was funny and I couldn't be more disappointed 
I broke the GroupMe
I brought the Fuckholes hiking 
I buy cards. They do suck 
I call an orange from the fruit drawer 
I call shenanigans on top golf 
I called Charlie Baker about that. He said as long as your body lands >6 feet away from the body next to you, and you are both wearing a mask, you won't be fined.
I called dibs on gronk but your communist ass wouldn't let me keep him 
I called him after the patriots won and went straight to voicemail 
I called malcolm butler's ascension back in like week 4 of the super bowl season. I've never been wrong 
I came
I came here to complain about the Patriots getting hosed but it doesn't seem right now 
I came home after saving lives to find that my internet isn't working. The gods truly hate me 
I came out with close to 200 messages from this groupme. Fuck if I am reading all of them 
I came to the GroupMe before going to my email and was led astray by Tony Goodwin.
I can
I can 100% understand the confusion
I can accept both names with pride
I can access it 
I can already feel myself being fucked over 
I can already guess that I'm last. 
I can always count on you, Bocker
I can always root for a good tie when it doesn't involve me
I can always trust Bocker to go all in. Love that guy 
I can appreciate that, Chan. Didn't mean to suggest you didn't respect her
I can attest 
I can attest from extensive experience that Jordan is an outstanding, fair competitor on the golf course 
I can be available Wednesday at 9 pm GMT, but only for an hour. Thursday only works if we start at 9 am and break at 10 am until 2 pm. I am available Friday all day except the hours of 11 am through 11 pm. Saturday works right now but I am likely going to bail on all of you when better plans arise. Sunday is out for sure because it is the holy day and I am afraid if I look at Goody, I will go straight to hell
I can be on after 730. Making dinner now 
I can be there 
I can believe it entirely after the call Brady got 
I can blame him for throwing a bad ball 
I can come over becks 
I can completely understand where you're coming from
I can confirm that geography was not taught in the first two years. Cannot comment about the last two 
I can confirm that he is a true freshman who is decent at his job 
I can confirm that I did not 🐐 Hanley 
I can confirm that it was not a good combination 
I can confirm that no GroupMe trope is overused

I can do this weekend but not the 23rd 
I can easily tell it with just wade and lebron. 
I can eat bread
I can eat dairy. I can't try it because all their ice cream flavors are cross contaminated based on how they prepare them 
I can explain it. Racism. 
I CAN FEEL IT 
I can finally be on YouTube 
I can find more open bars within walking distance of my culdesac suburban neighborhood in RI than I can within a mile of our Airbnb in the heart of Georgetown 
I can fucks with that
I can get an ultrasound study in less than 30 minutes almost 75% of the time. I has been taking anywhere from 1 to 5 hours to get a simple CT scan because apparently all the CT techs quit '
I can GroupMe throughout the whole flight thanks to free in flight wifi and my own personal charging plug 
I can guarantee I haven’t seen a single movie nominated for anything this year 
I can guarantee one thing. Turnout would have been much lower if McConnell hadn't saved us from the horcrux
I can guarantee that people were not mad at that 
I can hardly say that this is the worst I’ve seen the patriots. I am 0% concerned 
I can hate basketball and still be a homer. 
I can host Catan on Friday or Saturday. I can't host monopoly either night 
I can imagine hating golf 
I can just assume that @BC FB is going -1 -13 is skimming these messages since he’s not responding. 
I can just imagine goody crying over his keyboard as he reads article after article about how his hero is abandoning him 
I can just imagine him bringing his receivers into a room and playing film of a bunch of kids playing keep away at recess 
I can just see him watching the geiko hump day camel commercial on repeat
I can just take the orange line to Sullivan Sq. Probably easier than backtracking across Somerville to get me from my apartment or picking me up at work. 
I can make everyone steak 
I can neither confirm nor deny 
I can neither confirm nor deny. 
I can not eats there
I can now see how a barber's shears are more dangerous than a cop's gun. I am glad that barbers get more training than law enforcement 
I can only assume that all of business school occurs either on a golf course or a boat
I can only assume that Chan's redacted message was a statement of opposition to Tom Brady's activism. I DENOUNCE that. 
I can only assume that he looks at telescopes all day
I can only assume that means that Caserio has already been castrated 
I can only assume that this client is guilty of burning an American flag in the Capitol during the Jan 6 insurrection and is testifying in front of the Jan 6th Committee
I can only assume that UMass best auburn 
I can only assume that WOTM is the oft used acronym for Women Of The Moose
I can only assume the tasting menu night has been switched to the food court in the airport
I can only assume you waited this long to chirp me because you don't care about the Fuckholes enough to chirp a fellow Fuckhole. 
I can only do this with your support, Bocker
I can only hope that all Anesto conversation exclusively occurs in that chat, of which I want no part.
I can only hope that Joe took off work, drove to loon, then dropped his phone through ice I to a river so he never sees this 
I can only imagine how betrayed you feel that you have to wear a mask when in gatherings of 100 people or more
I can only imagine someone doing that if they were the type of person to not use an Oxford comma on an Insta post
I can only imagine what John says about me in the Fuck Joff GroupMe 
I can only kill myself a limited number of times chan. That won't be fun for me 
I can pick the patriots again, right? That's totally legitimate. 
I can pick you up becker 
I can picture him but no 
I can play a few rounds 
I can play a little later 
I can post gifs just fine
I can prescribe narcotics 
I can probably afford an Arby's steak. Let's go there 
I can respect the loyalty 
I can say that because I take happy pills
I can say we because my dad works for the building that the team plays in
I can see a fattie with low drive from a mile away, and not just because they're fat 
I can see Browns making a run at a qb by trade or free agency. If it were a smart team, I'd say a 4th rounder would be enticing enough to get a deal done, but the Browns will all but certainly trade a 1st
I can see it now. Bill Coughlin matches in EM at the combined Harvard program and Joff has to scramble to do family medicine in Idaho 
I can see it now. Darrowball to take over JP licks as gm/dictator 
I can see Jordan as Zuko. Pisses off his boss/dad (Fire Lord Ozai) and gets banished/fired from Accenture. Goes on a journey to find Aang, ends up finding himself and joining the good guys/killing terrorists
I can see Mama Goodwin being very excited to have you back home 
I can see Nick breeding to quickly amass an army of Bernie voters to get him into office before Bernie croaks 
I can see players not agreeing to this 
I can see some groups getting offended at rich white owners bidding on minorities to work for them
I can see that. Pancakes are essentially the breakfast version of cookies (when you aren't just eating cookies for breakfast, or cookie cereal)
I can see Whitebread kidnapping his new coworkers, bringing them to an abandoned warehouse in the middle of mattapan, putting a gun to their head, and giving them a riddle just to see how they react 
I can see why Brady would be so upset that the Raiders would pull David Carr out of retirement and choose him over both Brady and Derek Carr
I can send you mine is you want to see it for reference
I can skate decently, but I am awful at stopping 
I can state on record that Johnny Dash despises schizophrenic Goody. Therefore, keep doing it 
I can still come back from this. Only down 40. Jordan reed could have a good game 
I can still win this week asshole 
I can stop at Complete Nourishment for some snacks 
I can support Hawaiian
I can support this 100p
I can take care of any child who comes to an emergency department for any reason
I can taste the pepper from here. It is mildly cucumbery
I can taste the salt from here
I can tell why Beanboy likes Philly. The whole city smells like weeeeeeed
I can tell you now that if I ever considered rejoining the league, which I absolutely am not, I would never rejoin if keepers were a thing
I can tell you that if I could drink regular beer, I would never drink a single beer ever found in Joe's fridge
I can tolerate basketball talk if @Skimmer participates. If he’s not here, there is no reason to talk basketball 
I can understand that. Joe is an idiot.
I can understand them....
I can understand why goody wants obj. All everyone does is talk about how good he is, and then his team sucks and can't win games 
I can wait, since basketball isn't a sport 
I can zoom after 8 pm
I can. Basketball isn't a real sport
I can. He's generally an douchenutterbutterhead
I can. I'm just going to need both your and Kristen's social security numbers 
I can’t argue with it if it’s not your narrative I guess 
I can’t believe I’m rooting for Houston’s D line 
I can’t believe you would be caught dead in NYC 
I can’t choose what my old employer offered for retirement packages 
I can’t have pets that my landlord knows about 
I can’t help but feel that this loss was somewhat my fault since someone stole my patriots hat on Monday 
I can’t lose with Bocker on my side 
I can’t read the insta post (besides what was screenshotted), but maybe she wanted both faces on them? 
I can’t see Dola not coming back if he really wants to be here 
I can’t tell if he sucks like Scott Chandler or if he is literally just put out there to block 
I can’t wait for whoever is matched up with him to win. I think it was Bocker? 
I can’t wait to beat the fuck out of Emyr tonight. No one Vikings D scores fewer than 20 points 
I can’t wait to face Kovin next week and have him put up 140 
I can’t. I have two exams this week 
I cannot
I cannot
I cannot 
I cannot as well 
I cannot attend
I cannot attend 
I cannot be beholden to everyone else's dumb responses
I cannot be the one to add him back. I'm afraid that @Chanley Yelnats may have a stroke
I cannot bear to change my picture from something that my good friend @DJ Chanukah made for me 
I cannot believe that Marcus is the more educated one on the subject of race, given Goody's profile pic
I cannot claim to win that title. I graciously cede the championship to Morcus.
I cannot come over
I cannot comment on the current state of Las Vegas because I have not visited recently, but it was pretty lit when I was 8 
I cannot commit to late in the evening on Friday as I may have to be up for work at 5 am the next day. I need my beauty rest 
I cannot confirm nor deny
I cannot confirm nor deny Goody's statement, but I have no reason to doubt him 
I cannot consent to any action that involves the sodomization of my anus 
I cannot do another weekend, unfortunately. Goody and darrow, I'll be leaving with Olivia after work on 7/21 so you're welcome to hitch a ride with me. If you met me at MGH, we could all get picked up there 
I cannot do from 4-5 pm 
I cannot do this weekend 
I cannot express how proud I am of my team. Way to gut out a game 7
I cannot fathom why anyone would want a composition notebook
I cannot find statistics for Massachusetts as a whole for 2020, but there were 37 murders in Boston last year, compared to 55 this year. An increase of 48.6%
I cannot imagine a world with Gregg clones. That's at least 60% more Gs than I need
I cannot imagine continuing to support a racist clan that fired me without cause 
I cannot join in 
I cannot make any definitive comments based on that information alone. How long has the cyst been there? How does this person know that it is a cyst? Over what time course did it become red? Is it draining anything? Is it warm? Is this person febrile? Has someone put an ultrasound probe on it to see what the contents of the cyst look like, only to still order a CT scan of it?
I cannot make it tonight
I cannot remember a better QB playing in the last 20 or 30 years 
I cannot take Chris collinsworth seriously. Every comment he makes just reminds me why I mute madden every time I play 
I cannot take the boring content constantly spewed through this communication medium. We should go back to this GroupMe'a roots: talking football and shitting on Bock Boi 
I cannot tell if your question is serious or a joke that's going over my head, Chan 
I cannot this week either 
I cannot tonight but thank you for the invite 
I cannot tonight. I have dinner plans with Olivia and then plans with friends from school
I cannot wait for bocker go lose his shit over this 
I cannot wait for kovin to miss the keeper deadline again 
I cannot watch that 
I cannot zoom tomorrow as I work tomorrow night
I cannot, in good conscience follow an insta with that bio
I cannot. I'm getting my white coat tomorrow 
I can't argue with an all expenses paid trip to universal studios. 
I can't argue with math I guess 
I can't argue with that since it wasn't in the GroupMe
I can't ask him, he's not here saving Hyrule like you and me
I can't be a hypocrite of rules that I don't follow and make fun of Bocker for
I can't be bogged down with "compassion" 
I can't bear to imagine either of them not in my life every Sunday 
I can't because no one keeps track of it in a betting-specific GroupMe
I can't believe all of you 
I can't believe he did it. The son of a bitch did it. 
I can't believe he suggested making this an annual rivalry
I can't believe how fixed this game is
I can't believe how stupid John is right now 
I can't believe I have to do @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco's job with this now 
I can't believe I just referred to Domino's as a restaurant
I can't believe that Biden won't do anything about this 
I can't believe that Kovin is in Italy instead of squadding up with me
I can't believe that the Super Bowl Squares was still more rigged than the NFL tonight 
I can't believe that we didn't properly mourn the deaths of the innocent people killed by radical Islamic terrorists in the recent attack in Atlanta 
I can't believe that you let a registered Democrat spend so much time with JJ
I can't believe that, actually 
I can't believe the Pats didn't make an offer for Emmanuel Sanders 
I can't believe there are people thinking he's breaking 10 minutes
I can't believe they didn't push back the start of free agency 
I can't believe they just actually acknowledged the where is roger chant 
I can't believe they pay people to report on the NBA. That's like paying someone to report on a high school mock trial debate tournament. 
I can't believe Vinny fucked Bobby Moynihan 
I can't believe you guys are planning to leave your apartment on a work night!!!
I can't believe your wife just let's you put porn on the TV like that
I can't confirm or deny it, but I heard that Jordan tried to pay someone to alter the score card so that he would win. Sounds like cheating to me 
I can't consistently say that the Patriots did not have a game today
I can't copy and paste due to UWorld test, but it's the second video on youtube if you search "I used to love her legend of zelda remix"
I can't decide if Hard Knocks not finding an NFL team is hilarious or pathetic 
I can't decide if my favorite tom Brady photo shoot picture is this:
I can't decide if the biggest waste of money in the NFL is Suh or Calvin Johnson
I can't dispute that 
I can't do Monday. You'll have to change it back to Sunday for me 
I can't do the other weekend 
"I can't eat anything from
Anna's, so unfortunately I can't be unbiased "
I can't endorse anything that financially supports Joe 
I can't engage in discourse with you, apparently 
I can't even load gifs to find a clever response so I'm just going to declare that I won this argument 
I can't even tell if that's photoshopped or not 
I can't express any positive feelings about this in the GroupMe, but if I could.....
I can't fathom that you haven't heard of Kowloon 
I can't fathom the lack of self awareness into how much each of them suck 
I can't fathom why any Foxtrot would want a job outside of New England or Iraq 
I can't find a Backbar in Portland. Can you give directions?
I can't find a breakdown in the 2 seconds I took to look it up 
I can't find the Davio's in the international terminal 
I can't get over the fact that I feel like this joke was supposed to be "Foxtrot Hostel" but with a massive typo 
I can't get over the taxes and fees for these flights to and from Italy 
I can't give you $200 joe. Then I won't have money to keep him 
I can't go at 4:30. Sorry mang 
I can't handle this positivity
I can't help but notice that AP didn't score me 45 points. Time to drop everyone for the waiver wire, season is lost already 
I can't help that all the good Pokemon are scared of me 
I can't ignore that
I can't imagine a world where that doesn't work 
I can't imagine any bigger afront to my personal privacy than Bocker knowing where I was at any given time 
I can't imagine being this wrong. 
I can't imagine being this wrong. I would probably kill myself if I was Joe right now
I can't imagine being you for 24 hours a day 
I can't imagine that
I can't imagine the amount of celebrating in the Jboss household that's going to happen when they beat the unbeaten Panthers with a terrible team and rookie QB who hasn't played well
I can't imagine they were had any chance of winning
I can't imagine why
I can't imagine. Tell me more to help me wrap my brain around it.
I can't imagine. Tell me more to help me wrap my brain around it. 
I can't in good conscious see a movie with Willy Wonka as the action star
I can't in good faith open that link because you didn't send it through the appropriate social media app
I can't join tonight but just want to mention that Fox and the Knife is fantastic.
I can't judge him on his cockriding experience, so it doesn't bother me. Maybe he is truly the kick of cockriding
I can't let you move out on me without vetting this individual
I can't like your name, but I can damn well appreciate your creativity. 
I can't make the change online. I called but they don't open til 5, so I had to leave a message to request the change 
I can't not like that picture
I can't open your link for some reason
I can't possibly be expected to guess after being exposed to what a horrible person Marcus is 
I can't possibly be ranked lower than Becker 
I can't post anything negative in the GroupMe anymore or I get yelled at by @#JustFacts✅  and @Negative Chancy Reagan 
I can't pretend to have any clue what BB is thinking 
I can't read past the first two paragraphs, which say that JetBlue had the lowest rate of delays of any airline on that day. The paywall ruins your evidence
I can't remember if we've had this conversation before: what's everyone's opinion on the death penalty 
I can't respect anyone who is a Jets fan
I can't say I have access to pictures with Olivia, Frank, and Ricky in them. It was a losing battle before it even started
I can't say I'm a high volume purveyor of sitcoms, but I did feel like the underdog story was mildly compelling. Also Keeley being their definition of a supermodel is completely spot on for Britain 
I can't see the Renegades coming in last, Marcus, but then again neither can they 
I can't shake the feeling that Goodell is behind this somehow 
I can't sleep past 9 now, and I can't stay up past 12 without feeling like shit the next day. So neither. Very excited for med school 
I can't stand Cam being a poopy quarterback 
I can't stay mad at you 
I can't tell if this is a bit 
I can't tell if you meant to say "hair part" of if you legitimately get hard when they cut your hair to look like Edelman 
I can't tell which picture is my favorite
I can't tell why 
I can't tell you how offended I am that joe is ignoring texts from both myself and goody 
I can't tell you that information in this monitored forum 
I can't tell, is Auburn in the top 50% of the SEC?
I can't tell. Normally, I would think a player is actually hurt if he has to collapse to the ground while going off of the field. But It's Cam Newton, so he's probably just being a humongous bitch
I can't think of anything else I have to do that night 
I can't this week 
I can't tonight, I have an MPH thing I need to turn in
I can't tonight. I have an interview tomorrow for my public health capstone that I need to prepare for
I can't wait for a coresident who follows Bocker to send an anonymous screenshot to the program director. Gunna be lit. 
I can't wait for all of the qb's in the draft to suck 
I can't wait for all these people to get Covid and then bring it back to their communities, worsening the Christmas/new years spike 
I can't wait for Darrow the kick the shit out of your team goody 
I can't wait for fourth year....
I can't wait for Goff to suck and get benched halfway through his second season. 
I can't wait for goody to die and us to find out that he's never worked a day in his life and that he just spends all of his time playing sports quizzes and games on his phone
I can't wait for JC Jackson to get his pick six in the first quarter 
I can't wait for Mahomes to take over. 
I can't wait for Marcus to come in here and defend cam like he didn't bring his team to a strip club. 
I can't wait for my interest rate to double when I move 
I can't wait for the "BB doesn't give TB weapons" trope repeated from week 2 on 
I can't wait for the Biden-Romney face off that I'm convinced is still going to happen 
I can't wait for the day that I get so fit, that chan has to invite me to play on one of his intramural teams 
I can't wait for the Hillary/Bernie ticket to punch their ticket to the White House. Then I can't wait for Bernie to go all Frank Underwood on Hillary and take over as president, naming Ben and Jerry as co-vice presidents. 
I can't wait for the pics of @The Big Dick Bandit and Lil Abad smoking blunts with Josh Gordon and Priest Holmes 
I can't wait for your flight to be cancelled for weather and you somehow get stuck in Detroit again 
I can't wait that long
I can't wait til I'm poor as shit and living out of a house on goody's compound 
I can't wait to draft badly, perform badly, and put a great effort into coming in last place 
I can't wait to get Bock trauma naked 
I can't wait to give my two weeks and go on welfare like Bocker and Kovin. 
I can't wait to go to bed and wake up to find out that Emyr has raped my team  
I can't wait to ignore you 
I can't wait to listen to Dan, Gregg, and all the guys again
I can't wait to lose on a garbage time touchdown 
I can't wait to not pay you sandwiches when I'm wrong 
I can't wait to not watch another basketball game until 365 days from now 
I can't wait to see goody's reaction when CMac gets asked to fight on two days notice and gets his ass best 
I can't wait until 2024 when Joe Kennedy III gets the Dem nomination
I can't wait until I have to work with Bocker on a daily basis 
I can't wait until you apply to grad school and have to stay up until 2 am because you're so busy
I can't, I have a fundraiser to attend at 6:30 pm at McGreevey's. I hope to see everyone there 
I can't, I'll be working out
I can't. I already bought your gift. It was scheduling the Pats/Jets game in NJ for you. Tickets not included 
I can't. I have to work out that weekend. 
I can't. I'll be grading papers tonight. 
I care 
I care 
I care about baseball. The wall is 310 feet down the line, 389 to left center. Yankee stadium is 314 feet to right field and the wall is 30 feet shorter. Easier for Aaron judge to hit an opposite field home run than Devers at home. 
I care about Goody's grids 
I care deeply about this league, that's why I am quitting on you all
I care how good your defense is
I care that Jordan and Emyr win for two reasons. 1) the tale of the tennis ball retribution will be passed through my family for generations. 2) it makes your trade for aj green look worse. 
I cared so little about this game, I watched food network until 10 minutes left in the 3rd
I caught a tentacruel today. Pretty sweet 
I caught a weak ass ponyta but haven't even seen a growlithe
I caught both of the typos that you made in that sentence tho
I caught that after i pulled into my parents driveway. Seemed poetic 
I cave pretty easily 
I certified it, but I have two weeks or so to change it if something changes my mind 
I chalk that up to Pats D 
I chan also confirm that the oats in that container are just teeming with gluten.
I change my answer to this 
I change my answer. I believe I am Danielle 
I change my mind, 3 are doable 
I change my stance based on Goody's comment. Ridesharing will overtake taxis in all rural areas within the year. 
I change my stance. Only goody for that league spot 
I changed after graduation by becoming friends with @Chank Hill 
I changed our reservation to four on Saturday by the way. Unfortunately they made me push it back to 4:15. Everyone else is SOL. 
I Channot confirm but I Chan believe 
I charge a $600/hour consulting fee
I checked and double checked and triple checked, and Chan confirm that he did in fact finish in 9th place 
I checked my privilege right out of the groupme
I choose Blank Space (just bitter I couldn't do that as my punishment two years ago) 
I choose both narratives as true
I choose to ignore the fantasy score and instead focus on the score of a game that I have literally zero emotional connection to simply because it involves Joe losing, despite not going to Wakefield High 
I choose to read this as sarcasm 
I chose BC over Northeastern (despite cost) because I wanted more of a sports atmosphere. Look how far that got me
I chuckled that the Texans were adamant that Easterby would not choose the GM, and then the GM they hired was the biggest Easterby ally possible
I CIRCLEJERK WHEN I WANT TO CIRCLEJERK
I claim draft party hosting. 
I claim it. Also, I think that everyone with a job should be paying for the meals of people without jobs. The groupme should be a socialist welfare state 
I claim victory for that one 
I clearly said if manning beats the patriots and then goes on to win the super bowl. The pats losing wasn't the only stipulation 
I clearly warned you that you'd get price gouged
I complain about everything, this is the perfect conversation for me 
I complained. 
I completely changed the context of the joke. I only got the inspiration from someone much less funny than I am on a popular internet meme site 
I completely forgot about that vid
I completely forgot lol 
I completely missed that Theo came back
I concur 
I concur. 
I confirmed it in the groupme so it's confirmed 
I consider myself a Bocker expert and I can attest that be has insane katana skills that rival those of bearded Tom cruise 
I consume my social media videos from real American companies, like Instagram
I contributed a picture of my wood
I convinced Marcus. I should get a trophy. 
I convinced my friends from home to switch from Facebook messenger to groupme 
I could also be biased because I have never seen a quarterback with that skill set in the Patriots offense
I could also fuck with a shootout. Need Big Ben and one undetermined Pitt receiver to go off and Steelers D to flounder to keep my hopes alive in two leagues 
I could also support raiders 
I could average that for about 400m
I could be available 
I could be completely wrong, but that's the impression that I get from the very limited reading I've done on the topic. But that's not to say that it doesn't happen next year 
I could consider that 
I could definitely imagine goody doing something like that 
I could definitely see Darrowball being in the top three. He's a texter-while-driving-er, who knows what he'
I could fucks with chilling with the Fuckholes at bc basketball 
I could get all of that info from @Skimmer 
I could get behind a #FuckBocker campaign @Marcus Bauer 
I could go for a $120k cash bonus 
I could have been giving out loans! 
I could have found that soft spot in the zone 
I could have predicted that route 12 plays ago
I could have sworn that was picked
I could have walked from community to Sullivan faster. Still not there 
I could have. I am unhinged 
I could literally accomplish zero of the four required feats. Not even close 
I could luck into an albatross 
I could never be mad at you Bocker 
I could never forget such a core memory 
I could never give you an L
I could never imagine going to RI 
I could never play any of the elder scrolls or fallout games for one reason - the more items you hold, the slower you move. Ain't nobody got time for that 
I could never trust anything produced by a company that hired you 
I could not be less furious 
I could not imagine going to Europe with your girlfriend and not going to scope out villas for the boiz in Tuscany
I could not possibly care less about that update. And it still was the most important post that Joe had ever made 
I could probably consider making it 
I could probably get down to 9min/mile right now 
I could probably make 10 out of 80 
I could put anything online and it would have just as much value as what you're reading 
I could retire
I could root for Buster Posey 
I could say the same thing about your "Peyton is 🐐" argument that is in the works 
I could see going to a Sunday afternoon game against the Rays with a kid. Not an ALCS game 
I could so that in Kansas 
I could still win 
I could talk for days about it. Short answer: we should spend less and do a better job of couseling families of patients with terminal diseases so they aren't expecting doctors to try everything possible, even when the outcome is expected to be poor 
I could use a stat correction 
I could use some more WFH time like in med school 
I could use the extra $2.17 per shift 
I could very easily Google it but I don't want to 
I could very very easily see $325 as being a lot to pay for someone who has to pay rent, utilities, food costs, and gas/car payments so they can get to work. I'm not saying that 30k is a lot to pay in 12 years, but it's not as easy for everyone as you make it out to be. You're in a lot better position that you're giving yourself credit for. 
I could, in fact, also go for a steak and cheese on a gluten free roll
I couldn’t imagine ghosting my friends like that
I couldn’t imagine stepping into a grocery store in 2025. Grocery delivery is where it’s at. Walmart is just his gross southerness coming out of
I couldn’t. Doesn’t meant that Ramsey wasn’t out of position 
I couldn't be your rash doctor if I didn't do eagle ems 
I couldn't check whether he was on the 🐐 list or not 
I couldn't either. That's why I googled it. But she's famous 
I couldn't fall asleep and am now subjected to the last few minutes of this torture 
I couldn't figure it out
I couldn't find a membership price for Southie besides an unlimited 30 day trial for $70. I couldn't find anything about the 305 gym prices 
I couldn't find a recommendation for treatment for recurrence in a non-IFDVT scenario but I believe I remember from class that the treatment is pretty much the same. I don't believe the situation changes given that his clot is in his arm
I couldn't hate anything more than I hate jj watt 
I couldnt help but notice that Tatum has put up 28 and 21 the past two games, and Fultz hasnt played...
I couldn't imagine either because the account is in my dad's name
I couldn't imagine that
I couldn't intrude on your lovely date for your wife's birthday
I couldn't possibly imagine forgetting someone who signed my high school yearbook 
I couldn't possibly imagine supporting anything or anyone that brought anger to a fellow Hotel 
I couldn't possibly imagine to whom you are referring
I couldn't tell if that was the update or just me hitting level 20
I count at least 12 more
I count at least 14 wins on there 
I cultivated mass in my feet 
I currently have the sniffles
I cut you out of my life, remember 
I dealt with that shit for a while and now take happy pills and I'm all better
I debated doing it to fuck kovin over but decided it would be against the spirit of the league 
I decided I wasn't going to complain in the groupme about it, but as long as Goody is complaining about the MBTA, I might as well join in. 
I decided that if Tiger wins, I will watch my first-ever episode of GoT tonight and live tweet everything that's happening. Bocker says he doesn't care if GoT is spoiled, but it will make Marcus unhappy, which will in turn make his lover, Bocker, unhappy
I decided that I'm riding through the awkward stage and seeing what comes out on the other side 
I define his career as losing his starting job to Kaepernick 
I definitely can't then. I have a charity walk with my old job 
I definitely could explain it in detailed terms but it might be over your head so I'll let someone else try to dumb it down for you 
I definitely do not like sliding before the 2 minute warning
I definitely don't disagree with that 
I definitely don't let the play clock expire and waste my last time out 
I definitely eat cod, I just feel like it's the chicken of fish. Tastes good but doesn't have as much intrinsic flavor as some other meats/fishes 
I definitely haven't seen Ken Francis, J Francis, and Jack Francis in the same room 
I definitely know to what this is referring
I definitely know what OVO🦉 means 
I definitely know who that is
I definitely miss Chinese food 
I definitely remember why I owe you $10, but maybe you should just remind the rest of the GroupMe 
I definitely see marble color.
I definitely used a guide 
I definitely want to see the number of daily users before and after pokevision's shutdown. And after they banned all of the bots. Goody, your company can probably figure that out, right? 
I definitely would not have done what Joseph did. I am not a man nor woman for others
I definitely wouldn’t feel safe at Tweek’s house @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
I demand a full independent investigation into how this happened. It is only through independent arbitration that we will determine whether a buy-in was truly agreed upon. In fact, I am open to this special investigator looking at all aspects of league history: Goody stealing OBJ and Lev Bell, Joe trade raping someone every year, Jordan's awful trading/tanking history. I would hope the investigator also comments on the legitimacy of every single championship in league history and ensures that all members paid the appropriate dues and completed mandated punishments.
I demand a rematch 
I demand that @Skimmer argues our case pro bono all the way up to the Supreme Court. The only lawyer the defense has access to is Marcus. We have a clear advantage. 
I demand that the deadline be changed to November 15, 3 AM PST
I denounce @Joff Savarino for also not saying it’s Asian Pacific American Heritage Month
I denounce Alabama basketball and certain players on their team/recently dismissed from their team 
I denounce all clan members 
I denounce any movie that even mentions Nazis. I will not be stepping foot into a movie theater showing Indiana Jones 
I denounce anyone who is a fan of a sport financially supported by blood money
I denounce anyone who would falsely accuse him of this 
I denounce Capitol attacks 
I denounce Kovin's nazi ties. It is the worst part of being his roommate 
I denounce multiple players. Last I contemplated, at least 3 fit into that category 
I denounce Nazis. They are bad
I denounce Noah and Nazis
I denounce the Nazis and all their supporters
I denounce the shooter in my home state
I denounce them but a certain GroupMe thinks that there are fine people on both sides
I denounce this
I denounce this couple 
I denounce this level of skimming.
I denounce your hatred based on color 
I denounce your racism too
I denounced LeBroNazis
I deny that 100%
I did 
I did a 7 minute warm up, then 22 minutes doing the spring/rest thing Darrow suggested. Cooling down down
I did appreciate it. I appreciated how bad it was.
I did ask for an independent investigation
I did buy a pair but regular shipping. I'm not as smart as you 
I did click the message and read it. But I still don't understand the concept of texting me 
I did do the opposite 
I did enjoy season 1. I wouldn't go as far as this, but it was very good. 
I did feel extremely cringey and awkward the whole movie but I think that's because everything that was happening seems entirely realistic. And the fact that it is realistic makes me uncomfortable 
I did get a really awesome offer but this apartment is not pet friendly and unfortunately for us, she had a dog 
I did get about 1200 candy 
I did get Kobe earlier too, so that should be 10/13
I did get told by a patient today that by being a cis male, I was invalidating his experience 
I did go to Oktoberfest 
I did hatch this from a 10k egg 
I did have a cheesy post, but it wasn't discussed on the GroupMe so it actually never happened
I did have an issue yesterday 
I did have gluten free bread this past weekend though. So maybe I am kind of a traveling salesman 
I did hear that he didn’t have any help that year. Strange. 
I did it guys 
I did ketamine once. would not do again
I did know that which is why I said you never clicked the attestation in your email 
I did message Emyr. He said he was interested but unsure if he wanted to upgrade at WR. He never messaged me back so I went ahead in my talks with Jordan
I did my first moonlighting yesterday. $63.57 an hour x13 hours plus I got an extra $250/call for running two pediatric calls
I did no such thing. It was an auto draft 
I did not
I did not  
I did not agree to that
I did not ask about it's preferred use of pronouns 
I did not but I have gone to two soccer games at Fenway 
I did not call out @emyrbot
I did not come because I did not feel comfortable crashing a watch party at some random mit lab hosted by someone I did not know. Plus I went to the gym. For the first half. 
I did not enjoy that 
I did not enjoy this week's much. Last week's was dope
I did not fail. I clearly would be higher than 6th 
I did not feel a sense of pride storming the field with 6 wins senior year
I did not find her attractive. 
I did not get a kick out of that 
I did not get an email 
I did not get this bonus because I do not live in New York. And my hospital system is so financially devastated that they didn't give out any bonuses this year
I did not get told to WFH
I did not get/don't know what Jordan sent and I am sad 
I did not have the best time 
I did not have the clippers in my hand 
I did not keep McKinnon 
I did not know about the non-order thing until I was on episode 3 and Olivia said "isn't this the show you can watch from any order"
I did not know that you grew up as a southern retiree
I did not know you had a colonoscopy senior year. Also probably did not need to know
I did not laugh
I did not lie. 
I did not make any sound
I did not miss Bock boi
I did not offer that 
I did not receive the invite and I think it was because I had turned my hangouts offline. Would you please consider resending it, Mr. Chan?
I did not remember but thank you for reminding me 
I did not request to have Jamie send a dick pick to the GroupMe. I apologize that tagging him led to that,
I did not say anything about Wentz being injury prone
I did not see that and do not endorse that
I DID NOT see that coming!!!!!!
I did not see the movie but I did binge watch the series when it got put on Netflix. For a children's cartoon, it was actually really good
I did not skim 
I did not skim Wednesday frog nor did I skim chans Wednesday frog Photoshop 
I did not submit keepers 
I did not take a picture of my roast, as I fucked up and cooked it medium to medium well despite adhering to the recommended time on several recipes. But I did make a smoked paprika and rosemary compound butter that was fucking amazing 
I did not think that Chan was implying that Jake Brisket was ELIte based on his comment
I did not think that Harbaugh was a QB whisperer 
I did not think you should still be breathing
I did not use that white board 
I did not watch the Colts game and really have not watched them closely this season. Is Matt Ryan truly the problem in their offense? 
I did not. Saw that movie for the first time on trip to loon in 7th grade. Only time I've ever snowboarded 
I did not....
I did nothing except ask the question
I did order a ton of scans for the ED trauma resident though 
I did see it the next day before it disappears red 
I did see that
I did see. Just don't dignify college basketball with a post in the GroupMe 
I did select your name by accident first but deleted it. That's weird 
I did skim that that was the previous list.
I did that for Marcus's wedding because I don't care about him
I did that to catch you off guard 
I did the easy work. You and Morcus solved the original puzzle. We should go into a private investigating business together
I did the math. I cannot be in the Posa this year.
I did the punishment 
I did the same thing when I saw the new numbers last night
I did the tasting menu and say I got the tasting menu 
I did the work Thursday
I did! I put up 127
I did, in fact, forget that
I did. I ran for 23 minutes, did legs, and then did 10 minutes of abs 
I did. I'm making dinner, going to the store, and then waiting on you fuckers. But fair warning, I don't have a car so if you're doing something in Allston, I'm not going all the way there 
I did. She's not happy 
I did. Thank you for thinking of me. At least I have one friend in here 
I didn’t attend because I wasn’t invited. That seems to be happening a lot lately 
I didn’t even know I was supposed to get raptured today and I’m somehow still disappointed I didn’t 
I didn’t even see him have it in his hands. Don’t know what you’re saying 
I didn’t have fun
I didn’t have his bib so I couldn’t track him 
I didn’t know Darrow had an Australian accent 
I didn’t know he was still alive 
I didn’t know I was black until right now 
I didn’t know Stanton still existed
I didn’t know that happened because you assholes didn’t answer me when I asked what happened in the first half 
I didn’t know that was a thing. That’s fucked up 
I didn’t see that disclaimer before meeting either of those two individuals 
I didn’t think about it so I didn’t print it 
I didn’t want to make an OnlyFans joke with Jordan in here
I didn't
I didn't
I didn't @ you
I didn't appreciate them
I didn't ask a scribe his pronouns the other day and I got them wrong when introducing him to a patient. The long pink hair really threw me off 
I didn't assume you only used a wok. I'm sure you have a rice cooker too 
I didn't bid on anyone 
I didn't broach that on the first interview 
I didn't either. He's an Indian Cricketer
I didn't even get an interview :(
I didn't even get an invite to the school he attends. I feel so hurt right now 
I didn't even get to say hi 
I didn't even have the other 2 views included in a hand x-ray series! 
I didn't even look to see. Just took it from the Twitter after today's pregame ceremony 
I didn't even realize that I had the pleasure of kicking joe's ass this week 
I didn't even think of including ricotta. Include that on my list 
I didn't get an interview at a single NYC program. I assume the Goody prevented me from moving their because he thought I would dethrone him 
I didn't get any emails but got a postcard thing 
I didn't get asked about diversity once in my residency interviews
I didn't get asked for my address.....
I didn't get invited...
I didn't get it on first pass but now I see that he was making a pornhub joke
I didn't get my calendar today. This wedding is horseshit 
I didn't get one 
I didn't get that scoop in my report
I didn't get the notification to my phone what was the final punishment 
I didn't guess amare because he literally spent a total of 12 minutes on the court through like six seasons 
I didn't guess him specifically because you already did. 
i DiDnT hAvE sErViCe
I didn't have to pay him once I made him laugh with the bonesaw reference 
I didn't keep winning
I didnt know anyone actually followed that rule still 
I didn't know anyone actually liked basketball, john. I just thought it was something to fill up sportscenter's time when football season ends 
I didn't know before tonight. But like 12 people all caught the gengar so I guess multiple people can catch the same one 
I didn't know either so I didn't buy one
I didn't know for sure either, so when you asked yesterday, I didn't want to give you the wrong answer
I didn't know I needed him, but I needed Stephen Jackson on this team 
I didn't know Joe Paterno worked for the Blackhawks organization. 
I didn't know that Nick Mullins entered the NBA draft
I didn't know that they mailed traffic tickets 
I didn't know Welfare queens could bet 4-digit sums of money on sports teams
I didn't know western mass had baseball 
I didn't know what this was until 45 seconds ago but this might be the greatest thing I've seen in months 
I didn't know which one I liked better so I posted both
I didn't leave because of the buy in. I left because I was bad at fantasy and the way the rules currently are, your mistakes are compounded annually and I was never going to get to point where I enjoyed managing my team
I didn't like season 2 as much 
I didn't mean to imply that you were in the wrong. I am only thinking of the outcome of the #ThirstTrapShooter case'
I didn't need to post because I called BB to thank him myself
I didn't notice how absence. Guess I just don't value his presence
I didn't notice it 
I didn't notice the chocolate milk before. That makes the picture fantastic. 
I didn't pay attention because I didn't think it would apply to me 
I didn't peg you as a scat guy but to each their own 
I didn't pick up Twill
I didn't read any of that post, but if you're fighting the tyrannical social justice warriors, count me in 
I didn't read it all, but this study says that NYC subway propagated the coronavirus outbreak in NYC. Just another reason public transportation sucks - Shared a document: https://s.groupme.com/QrzdH9
I didn't read the thread but everything Morcus said sounds very true 
I didn't read the whole thing but there was a clip of a statement that his freshman year roommate wrote about him getting smashed all the time and that he trusted the accuser way more than kavanaugh 
I didn't read this, but the title seems to support Goody and me so I am posting it
I didn't realize he was cut, he was the last "big name" running back on the board. I started the bid at $3 trying to preemptively outbid people who had less auction money and I had. Turns out it was a great strategy and I got the player
I didn't realize you were over 35 years old 
I didn't receive my league invite this year 
I didn't reply because I thought it was a rhetorical question
I didn't report it. Skimmer 
I didn't say anything 
I didn't say happy birthday yet
I didn't say it was well executed. I said his effort was good 
I didn't see 
I didn't see any of the 3rd quarter or most of the 4th so I can't speak to that 
I didn't see it happen. Don't believe you
I didn't see it. Can I watch it somewhere?
I didn't see the play that CG got hurt on but the way he walked off the field, I have diagnosed him with a broken collar bone 
I didn't see them mention anything about gluten free options in the article 
I didn't skim
I didn't skim. I just chose not to read it
I didn't skim. I was simply reacting to Morcus's post from a few hours ago. #MyNarrative
I didn't strike out once 
I didn't tell. I asked nicely. Even used please.
I didn't think he was gunna make it in on that play
I didn't think I could hate Marcus as much as I do right now 
I didn't think I had to offer that. I thought it was implied 
I didn't think it was a fake since the whole defense was in coverage and the announcers said "now they'll go for it" five seconds before they snapped it 
I didn't think Joe counted under that lesson that I learned 
I didn't think that I would like it more than BotW but it far exceeded expectations
I didn't think the vibrator was meant for him 
I didn't want cider. Skimmer 
I didn't want to be included on this list anyway 
I didn't want to be the first one 
I didn't want to say anything the other day.....but I am gunna need you to shovel that into my mouth real quick
I didn't want to say that since Republicans don't believe in biology
I didn't watch any of the game last night but I can only assume based on the score that lebron sucks 
I didn't watch the game but I heard that we lost 
I didn't win. OUR team "won."
I didn't work last night so it automatically wasn't the worst 
I didn't, however, include desserts. 
I didn't. Heard it was bad
I digress, but if any Fuckholes want to come over for the Sunday night pats game, you are welcome at my abode 
I disagree
I disagree
I disagree
I disagree 
I disagree 
I disagree and disrespect it
I disagree Jamie, I still pay to attend games and stay til the end. I'm the least of BC athletics' worries 
I disagree that that is a shitty argument. That's the best one we've heard thus far. I always have said that darrow was the true champion. 
I disagree that that was a travel and would like to see a replay 
I disagree that that's what is happening 
I disagree that you disagree 
I disagree with both of the aforementioned statements 
I disagree with rioting and looting but I am also not a POC who has been systemically oppressed and a victim of institutional racism for my whole life. I think I will reserve my personal judgement until I am in the shoes of the people who felt the need to riot because of how they are treated
I disagree with scheduling as a matter of luck. You come to play week in or week out and don't make excuses. Except for the other day when I made excuses for being unlucky, that was an exception 
I disagree with that. Where is the wall?
I disagree with the last part of that statement. Greater access would increase addiction. You're exposing more people to communicable diseases and their is a known association between addiction and petty theft, breaking and entering, burglary, etc. You may reduce violence but you worsening other situations 
I disagree with whatever opinion Darrow has on the matter 
I disagree with you. 
I disagree with your judicial philosophy 
I disagree, I heard you are good with balls
I disagree, John. I have the sixth highest scoring player (Big Ben). I should be Bruce, as his P/HS value is the 6th highest. I agree with becker. 
I disagree. Everyone loves me 
I disagree. He's only a second round pick. He never stood a chance at being successful 
I disagree. I don't trust Tennessee's offense or defense 
I disagree. I hate this 
I disagree. I love the commissioner. I have never said anything mean about him, nor have I ever felt animosity towards him or his decisions.
I disagree. I think it speaks to the robust data that's necessary to support therapies and interventions that can be the difference between life and death (not that my presentation is about that)
I disagree. I was having plenty of monogamous sex before Becker and Kristen were dating 
I disagree. I'm a big turkey sandwich guy. I just hate Granny Smith applies 
I disagree. It made me feel like I was back in the game 
I disagree. Kovin never asked for help 
I disagree. The real way to screw the couple is to murder them the day before the wedding. They lose all that money and never get to enjoy their special day
I disagree. Watching him doom his career from afar has been pretty satisfying. 
I disagree. We come to agreements all the time 
I dislike basketball.
I dislike becker. 
I dislike days exclusively for rounding. Could be so much more efficient. Always takes way too long.
I dislike French food, even though I have never really had it, simply based on my preconceived notion that all portions are tiny and all restaurant staff members are snobby 
I dislike how I lost my voice as the liberal fuckhole. Now i just take backseat to Nick 
I dislike that holding call 
I dislike the GroupMe yielding to bocker 
I dislike the power rankings 
I dislike the Sprint guy more 
I dispute cummy not being up there 
I dispute that as being more realistic. 
I dispute that you're the "PeoplesChamp" so you're not "Undisputed"
I dispute that. I won without assistance 
I ditched Emma. She was weird 
I do 100% understand, if the theory is correct about someone in his family being sick, why Gregg would want to stay. Also, essentially he got a promotion to host of his own show. Tough to turn that down
I do 65% of the cleaning; Olivia does 35% of the cleaning. 3rd roommate does nothing. 
I do 90% of the cooking. Olivia helps when I cook 
I do agree. Overtime rules suck 
I do also recognize that Thomas leaving was not exclusively Thomas's decision and that if the Patriots truly wanted him to stay, they would have made that happen last year during his contract extension. Bill is not without blame, of course.
I do also very much enjoy using that particular steak cooking video, to be fair
I do appreciate the invite <3
I do appreciate when my government officials denounce terrorists
I do but I don't look nearly as attractive 
I do denounce that
I do do my own pipe 
I do drugs like everyday 
I do feel pretty bad about supporting confirmed beta Mark Suckerberg
I do hate when @Beanboy doesn't wear a helmet
I do have a recipe. 
I do have an iPad and it sits in a box in my basement. I haven't touched it since I lived in Somerville in 2016
I do have an MBA 
I do in fact mind. It’s past your bedtime 
I do it every morning by myself 
I do kind of disagree with her opinion that it’s caving. Dems either get the vote on DACA that they were promised or they shut down the government again in 3 weeks. Pretty much in the same spot as before, maybe slightly better. 
I do know that Darrow liked my album, which makes me feel cooler than I actually am 
I do like buffalo chicken would would rather a high quality ground sausage instead. Onions on pizza are dope, especially if they are carmelized 
I do like cortland too but I think they're better for baking than eating. 
I do like the mattress, it's decent for the price. It's comfy, you don't sink into it but it's not too stiff
I do like to be drizzled with balsamic
I do love hogs 
I do love the “the NFL loves the patriots” point of view. Do they remember spygate and deflategate and the nfl changing the rules so DBs can’t fuck WRs
I do love the hotdog picture 
I do not 
I do not agree that this was the best decision for MA, but I hope improved supply will allow hospitals to get involved again
I do not agree with putting that all on your defense. I agree with Joe. Run it twice. 
I do not attend the book club and am 200% sure I understand Nock's joke 
I do not believe so 
I DO not believe that he was referring to making a list for someone
I do not believe this story, as Darrow shoots -32s on the reg
I do not but I enjoy that many attractive women find the brand comfortable. Win win situation if you ask me 
I do not close until Jun 4
I do not condone that
I do not condone Tony's comments.
I do NOT consent to that 
I do not consent to that. 
I do not deny being close friends with Jeremy. However, people can grow 
I do not endorse soccer talk but it is infinitely more important than basketball talk. Can't divide by zero
I do not get this and I know that I do not care that I don't get it
I do not hate my good friend @Skimmer , who I miss very much
I do not have access to that drive 
I do not have an adult job
I do not have an issue with and PhD going by doctor. I have never personally run into a situation where I mistook a PhD for an MD 
I do not have enough expertise to argue for or against gender reassignment surgeries but saying you shouldn't do something because it hasn't been studied would mean that we shouldn't do any experimental thing ever.
I do not have it yet but will be buying it sometime during 3rd year
I do not have my work schedule for that weekend yet 
I do not know Johnny O' Malley
I do not know what ck stands for 
I do not know who Candace Owens is either, kovin 
I do not like Chan's Twitter, but my resolution is to be more accepting of GroupMe contributions
I do not like how Jalen Ramsey's contract is going to affect Gilmore
I do not like Romo as an announcer
I do not like that 
I do not like that like 
I do not like the Sunday night football crew 
"I do not like them, Chan-I-Am
I do not like them in the snow
I do not like them on radio
I do not like them in the cold
I do not like them when I'm old
I do not like them with a tree 
I do not like them like joey "
I do not like TJs 
I do not love Joff not going to the concert 
I do not own cable tv. Therefore not a boomer 
I do not partake in the GenZ or the TikTok 
I do not pay for cable and my internet only plan is expensive. I am paying more for FiOS because I've had so many issues with Comcast
I do not recline 
I do not recognize the existence of a Fuck Bock Boi groupme
I do not remember voting on any change to that rule coming into the season 
I do not remember, it was at least a year ago. 
I do not think he will be fired but I also will be 0% surprised if the eagles part ways
I do not think that the wire suffers at all from time
I do not think we have spent enough time discussing that picture of Morcus shitting out the remnants of 13 bagels and a gallon of ice cream, or whatever he eats for breakfast 
I do not typo self corrections 
I do not understand taking that delay of game when your kicker is as rusty as the trombone Darrow got last night
I do not value John's opinion on travel as he also wanted to visit India 
I do not want the chiefs to win
I do not want to work in Stowe 
I do not watch TWD
I do not watch videos in the GroupMe 
I do not,@Marcus Bauer 
I do occasionally piss on my mirror 
I do really enjoy this method of running out the clock. Not just running straight at the Dline and hoping to find a hole 
I do really like Saquon though and happy to see him be on a good team 
I do remember in micro when they were trying to tell us that the Ohio River valley was not encompassed in "the Midwest" and that's how you identify the distinct epidemiological distribution of two different fungi 
I do remember last season that I was told that a player who was dropped would still be worth their auction value +10
I do remember that 
I do remember where they are all buried though 
I do see where you are coming from that this is a terrible time to do it, would have been better during the off-season but hard to make the decision without the most recent calf/bone/ankle/foot thing 
I do take very large dumps because my colon works extra well 
I do that. My credit usage right now is 1% of my allotted 16k between two accounts
I do that. Skimmer 
I do too but I can't find it on FB now
I do too. But if a bunch of governors are telling me that they aren't getting doses when they expected them, I trust the governors over the Trump admin 
I do understand your argument that it fosters growth of the non-Amazon job market. Just think that opportunity would be more influential in other areas of the country
I do want them to double dip in OT. Would also want edge, DT, WR, safety, RB, center, guard, LB, kicker, owner, ball boy, private jet, backup QB, and CB 
I do watch the show, but that is one of the funniest clips I've ever seen. And I only know that from actually watching the show because no way I would watch a video in the GroupMe
I do what I can for the American people
I do what I can to keep this groupme moving forward 
I do wonder what would have happened if Josh stayed 
I do, however, strongly believe that there is an imbalance of power/talent, which directly leads to these noncompetitive games and (in my personal perspective) makes college football less interesting than it has the potential to be. I do not have a solution to fix this problem, but I feel strongly that it exists.
I do, however, yield my support to Kristen 
I do. That was against the Saints defense. Not Seattle. Also the goal line fade works roughly 6% of the time. They have much better calls for goal line situations that they could have gone to 
I documented a picture of all the people I came into contact with in NH 
I don’t agree with you there 
I don’t believe that 
I don’t believe that I have. You’re just being #JustFalse❌ rn
I don’t believe the data you posted because I trust your #JustFacts✅
I don’t believe you 
I don’t blame him for being mad that the yellow is getting white washed 
I don’t care about ST spoilers but do care about MoN spoilers 
I don’t care about win expectancy, I only care about winning, so I don’t quite know what Pythagorean win expectancy means. Can I get an explanation from my good friend Goody 
I don’t care that much 
I don’t disagree with your assessment, but instead acknowledge that my personal preferences differ from yours. I would want a yard
I don’t do drugs because drugs are bad 
I don’t drink energy drinks so I don’t have a real opinion 
I don’t even know how to respond. I’m literally shaking with rage
I don’t find Kimmel funny but that’s a ridiculous reaction from the manchild (TM Sabrina Carpenter) 
I don’t get it but I didn’t like it 
I don’t get it. Why don’t they just draft talented guys and go 2-0?
I don’t get to see this game but I’m sure @Jamie Bourque could never be wrong 
I don’t have a food allergy. I have an autoimmune disease  
I don’t have any evidence, but you’re wrong 
I don’t have insta so I could never do that 
I don’t have much to add, or really know if this point matters, but I think the emotional response we’ve seen is due to the fact that gun legislation has been tried in the past and has repeatedly been shot down in republican backed congresses and legislation that was put in place has been rolled back by the current administration (i.e. the arguably unconstitutional regulation of gun sales to mentally ill). There was also a previous assault rifle ban that expired in 2004 because a Republican congress chose not to renew it. I’m not saying the emotion is beneficial, but I think it’s fair to say it’s coming from a place of frustration due to systemic inaction on an issue that people are obviously very polarized about 
I don’t have the balls for that 
I don’t have the emotional stability to understand that at this moment 
I don’t know 
I don’t know at this point
I don’t know how Mahomes didnt get a make up “full body weight” RTP call
I don’t know how you can use virtual measurements without using technology to confirm that your spot is actually correct
I don’t know how you didn’t figure that out given the fact that you’re a black man in a white familiar 
I don’t know if that’s a compliment or an insult 
I don’t know if that’s actually true but it sounds right
I don’t know if you’re qualified, @Wednesday, Inc. You have to be really good at looking up random sports statistics, sitting through 20 person meetings that last 3 hours, and coming up with project names that end up being rejected 
I don’t know man. She kind of m looks like Kermit the frog
I don’t know of a single patriots fan who takes him seriously and anything that happens with him is a non-issue 
I don’t know what was worse: that take or your opinion on apples
I don’t know where the th came from but let’s pretend it was purposeful 
I don’t know who Jeff is 
I don’t know who that is 
I don’t know who that is but she has a good dog 
I don’t know who was running the low route on that high low concept but they were more open than Pop
I don’t know who would be the best to come off the bench. There are just so many options. What do you think, Emyr? 
I don’t know, you look it up 
I don’t know. You tell me 
I don’t let the groupme dictate my social media habits 
I don’t like being lied to. I was promised an argument on ppr 
I don’t like him or the kid either 
I don’t like it 
I don’t like Romo’s voice but I like his analysis. I like that it’s geared to people who actually understand more than the basics of football 
I don’t listen to his music. The only song I could name by him is mind your manners and that’s like 7 years old 
I don’t live bb but I love BB
I don’t mind me some Mack Hollins but I wish Kyle Williams got some of those deep route reps. Particularly that one Mack dropped would be a great route for Kyle
I don’t mind the firing, but only because I literally don’t care about the Browns. You’re already the laughing stock of the league. Do whatever the fuck you want 
I don’t plan to act as competition for your drug and/or gun running, whether that me real life or board game based 
I don’t pretend to understand any of the kicking rules anymore 
I don’t quite know why Chan isn’t jumping on the bandwagon to bury me but I like it 
I don’t read barstool. My comment was my own. Also who is jeff 
I don’t really know what Erin does so
I don’t recognize degrees attained from the degree-mill that is Boston Univetsity 
I don’t recognize the black man in that picture
I don’t recognize the name Marcus. That’s his dead name
I don’t remember ever doing this scoring method 
I don’t say you can’t have fun. I just point out all the areas from which you have stripped fun from your life 
I don’t second Joe’s motion because I have four wins and would end up with none if I give them up 
I don’t see anything specific about Krebs cycle snaps. 
I don’t see Christian Gonzalez once on the highlight real which means he was perfect
I don’t see pictures 
I don’t share toilet paper with my current roommate. She buys all her own stuff
I don’t suck. I’m 4-3
I don’t take any fantasy suggestion Goody makes or agrees to seriously 
I don’t think any of them dislike me. They just don’t think about me 
I don’t think benching Tyrod helped...
I don’t think he looked that uncomfortable throwing that…….
I don’t think I’ve cringed that hard at a picture in a long time 
I don’t think I’ve ever loved Joe more than I do at this moment 
I don’t think it was the right decision because his teammates are upset about him not playing 
I don’t think multiple Gronks won 
I don’t think Reddit was correct 
I don’t think that Brees is overrated. He’s a HoF in my mind. Probably not top 10 of all time 
I don’t think the color of Bocker’s skin matters. We all hate him just as much regardless of his race #TeamBocker🏌🏿
I don’t think the int was on him. I think Henry flattened the route expecting Drake to hit him before the safety
I don’t think things are running too well down there 
I don’t think we can definitively say that John is the fastest Fuckhole because Emyr has never run a marathon 
I don’t think you can 
I don’t think you can ever recover from that 
I don’t understand the incentive to drive points down. We’re in a 2 qb league and this is the lowest scoring league of the three i am in. I feel like we should seek out every opportunity to earn points within the standard fantasy football rules
I don’t want a pity invite
I don’t want Jordy. 
I don’t want Sherman coming off an Achilles year. I’ll take Rowe and Jones in the slot 
I don’t want to just be average. I want to be my own person 
I don’t want to talk about that 
I don’t work 
I don’t. Don’t try and fuck the Pats 
I donate $5 a year to get a calendar and a personalized notepad. Pretty good deal if you ask me
I donated to charity the other day and gave up my seat on the t today and I don't have any good fortune. What am I doing wrong??
I don't
I don't
I don't actually think there are any, I believe you answered them all. Just making you sweat
I don't actually want to put in the effort to write one myself, but I think someone else should do it 
I don't admit I was wrong, but goody did say Friday 
I don't answer random questions with typos in them
I don't because he told us he wasn't coming to Stowe so he could study for exam.
I don't believe charter schools are required to provide special education which costs a lot more. When students leave public schools to go to charter, they take funding with them and leave the public schools underfunded and forced to provide extensive special education to a greater percentage of their students 
I don't believe for a second that IT was only tweeting emojis because he was watching a tv show. He was either trying to troll the media/fans or a big trade fell through 
I don't believe him*
I don't believe I was at the Christmas party 
I don't believe in inequality. We are all equal. 
I don't believe in journalism that is entirely based on grabbing someone's words and twisting them around to create an inflammatory article. It's a bullshit practice and it's stupid that athletes have to calculate every word they say so it's not spun around against them. Sports reporting and media-athlete relationships would be much better if journalists weren't shit heads and actually asked relevant questions that were meant to inform their reader base on things that actually matter 
I don't believe in stats. I trust feel. If you go for it on 4th and don't get it, you are almost in the same spot as you are now. Hoping for a stop and a td
I don't believe it
I don't believe that it was just one 
I don't believe that Jordan ever denied that he hasn't had a guy unleash a Hyper Beam on his face 
I don't believe that Marcus's buy in rule was in regard to not paying the third place team, it was in response to lowering the buy in to $25. And even if it was in response to the third place team not getting paid, it's just evidence that the rule change was opposed, contrary to Goody's claim 
I don't believe that that show was ever worth investing a second of your time.
I don't believe that that's true 
I don't believe that the basketball team even exists. It's a group of paid actors who pretend to lose every night 
I don't believe that you should tell me how to express my gender 
I don't believe that's possible 
I don't believe these numbers. This power ranking is rigged.  
I don't believe you 
I don't believe you 
I don't believe you. Despite the fact that you liked Jordan's original post, I don't believe you actually read it, which means you're a skimmer 
I don't believe you. Prove it by killing Becker first 
I don't believe you. Straight-edge Goody doesn't drink
I don't blame him for wanting to be a starter in the league, but it's a terrible look to come out now and complain about your role after you have ruined your team's season 
I don't boil the success of my fitness regimen down yo the number of steps I take. I judge it by the number of hearts I break 
I don't by this recent narrative that he's immature and not as smart as other QBs
I don't care about excuses chan, I care about results. 
I don't care about Gonzaga but I am happy that Joe is unhappy
I don't care about how it works. I just want it to be done and interpreted as soon as I order it 
I don't care about learning. I just want to confuse people until they admit that I'm right 
I don't care about that call because we won the World Series 
I don't care about the flag, fucking catch that ball Meyers
I don't care about the likes, but I care that people understand good humor. Amazon Prime. Prime Minister. This was objectively funny.
I don't care about the speech. I care about the name of the speaker 
I don't care about your rankings 
I don't care if he's concussed. Ball hit his hands. 
I don't care that much 
I don't care what side of the aisle is proposing those things, if it doesn't help with the response to coronavirus, it shouldn't be in this legislation. Period. 
I don't celebrate fantasy injuries 
I don't click on links in the GroupMe
I don't concern myself with hypotheticals that couldn't be 
I don't concern myself with nonbelievers 
I don't deserve to even be photoshopped near Tom Brady after my team's performance 
I don't deserve your love
I don't disagree with picking garoppolo, but I admit that in the REALLY small sample size we've seen, he hasn't been stellar. But you also have to remember the Chiefs game when Brady got benched and Jimmy G drove a malfunctioning offense to a touchdown. So I think with more game reps, he wouldn't be the second coming of Tom Brady, but he would be better than you're giving him credit for. I also really don't like when people make point out that Brady is going to outplay Garoppolo's contract. No one would have ever seen that coming two years ago, and BB didn't want to put his team in a situation like the Colts were in when manning had his neck surgery. I liked picking a quarterback in that spot, but I just think the pick looks bad when you consider that AJ McCaron was picked in the 5th (maybe 4th?) round and he was a more "NFL" ready qb in terms of the program from which he came 
I don't disagree with that. But I still don't believe in the sacrifice of short term students' happiness for a shot at long term sports improvement. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that a new stadium attracts a better coach, gets a winning team, etc.
I don't dislike the Bears, Jordan. I resent that they were picked over more exciting teams for the TotF so I am taking out my resentment on Joe
I don't drink beers 
I don't eat ice cream anymore, but thanks for the offer 
I don't either, but my parents do so I use slingbox. Or Olivia's family has direct tv so I can live stream through that as well 
I don't either. They have been passed down from generation to generation
I don't either. Thought I was the only one
I don't even know how that happened 
I don't even know if that's what you were doing
I don't even know what that is 
I don't even know where Londonderry is 
I don't even know who the dude on the Bruins that just scored is but I don't hate it 
I don't even know why you're typing to him if he can't read 
I don't even know. I only have it on my iPad. I will have to look when I get home 
I don't even like wearing my white coat in clinic. I would never want to wear it to a conference 
I don't even remember who she is or why we hate her
I don't even respect you enough to show up and boo you
I don't ever want Sanu playing safety on 4th and 3 ever again 
I don't expect anyone to read links posted in the GroupMe 
I don't fault Joe. It's pretty easy to mooch off the important people in your life. Just ask @#JustFacts✅ 
I don't feel as bad looking at Marcus, Jordan, and somewhat Kevin's scores 
I don't feel bad. He knew the punishment 
I don't feel bad. It's not like you're even applying for grad school 
I don't feel connected to the BC team. I watch all the games and still couldn't name more than 20 people on the team. Plus, even the players I do know are gone in a year or two. Tom Brady has been around for 17 years 
I don't feel inclined to share my rankings, only to be shamed for my choices. I'll keep my fruit preferences to myself 
I don't feel like doing the math but you need to know that circumference = 2πr and need to know what the radius of the Earth is 
I don't feel right rooting for Marcus but he's clearly in the right here 
I don't feel that sad about it 
I don't find this humorous 
I don't fly anything other than JetBlue. I'd rather pay extra to be comfortable and entertained
I don't follow politics well enough to provide a clear answer that doesn't make me look stupid 
I don't foresee that will ever be a problem
I don't forgive you
I don't forgive you. I'm going to throw out all of this dip just to punish you 
I don't fuck around. All about that Ticonderoga life 
I don't fucking know who Jeff is but I would never be on your team after you disrespected me like that. 
I don't fully trust the chiefs, even though they are 14-1. They pretty much have won by less than a touchdown for the last several weeks. 
I don't get 
I don't get how I am not considered the most athletic member of this GroupMe 
I don't get how you get illegal formation penalties like that. You should know where to line up. No excuse 
I don't get how you possibly can get thrown the ball 11 times and only have 3 catches if you're as big and talented as Jeffrey. All I can say is that Kevin rigged this game. 
I don't get Internet signal from Porter to Kendall. I'm good every other spot on the red line and every other kind 
I don't get it, I'm saying that Tommy Meatballs will cover 
I don't get it. Marcus looks the same 
I don't get it. The man got nominated. Isn't that the purpose of the movie? 
I don't get it. Why do stuff you don't want to instead of just staying home and watching football
I don't get it. You can't even see his skull
I don't get most QT movies. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Bastards. None of them do it for me
I don't get raped ever since that Thanksgiving party
I don't get that joke 
I don't get the joke so I'm just going to laugh awkwardly 
I don't get the reference. If only there was a tweet to provide context 
I don't get the similarities. You're talking about college football. I am talking about going to a real sporting event, like a Bruins game, where you pay $50 to get a Stanley cup with the Bruins logo on it filled with beer
I don't get what reporters don't understand. Ask belichick questions about scheme and he'll open up. He doesn't give a shit about any non-football related question 
I don't get why it's so hard to run a rub route or pick play. 
I don't get why other teams can do it (which they did) and it's fine but not the patriots, who clearly did their homework in discussing it prior to the game with league officials 
I don't get why people like you 
I don't give a fuck in a 10 year old knows how to score a duck and render out the fat while making an orange liqueur reduction. 
I don't give him credit for a bad defensive penalty 
I don't give him credit for any willingness to go for it on 4th because it is 100% a result of not being able to recruit a kicker
I don't hate America, Jordan. I voted because our grandfathers fought for us to have the right to vote. 
I don't hate LeBron because he wins. I hate LeBron because he's a bitch 
I don't hate most of these people. I hate people from high school because I was forced to associate with them, but if I ever didn't like someone at BC, I just wouldn't interact with them. None of my dislikes every spread to hatred
I don't hate the backfield 
I don't hate the WHO. I am not mad, I am just disappointed.
I don't have a 3) yet but will update as I think of them 
I don't have a dog in this fight because me trying to win is still worse than everyone who tried to tank 
I don't have a premium cable package. I don't get ESPN 
I don't have a prime credit card, but I buy everything from paper towels to kitchen stuff to books from Amazon and couldn't imagine paying shipping on everything I buy. Well worth it for me 
I don't have a problem with TP (unless it's one ply because literally go fuck yourself) but sometimes you benefit from just feeling a little bit cleaner
I don't have a pun for Edelman, sorry John 
I don't have a Tesla, so by default I'm not #1 
I don't have access to the league to see the results, if I even wanted to write a LM note 
I don't have an iPhone and would never buy AirPods, even if I did 
I don't have an opinion on that matter but I'd like to state that I read your comment while Digletting 
I don't have any evidence to support this, but I feel like that's 90% of entry level business employees 
I don't have either but I use my iPhone health app to track my weight when I remember to enter it in there 
I don't have faith in Kevin pulling anything out
I don't have food allergies. I have an autoimmune disease and an intolerance. 
I don't have friends or female friends or any shred of athleticism
I don't have IG. That was just tweeted by rappaport. 
I don't have Instagram 
I don't have it. Can you send it so I can save it?
I don't have live and never have owned an Xbox
I don't have much confidence 
I don't have ps4/xb1, but if you buy one for me, I'll download Fortnite and be happy to host
I don't have the answers, I am just asking the questions
I don't have the dedication to be honest
I don't have the stones to do it 
I don't have the time or desire to worry about stock trading, but thanks for the offer 
I don't have this problem ever
I don't have to buy a tv, so it's not something I have to worry about
I don't have to imagine it. I just have to look at Reddit. It's disgusting
I don't hear any valid excuses here 
I don't hit snooze, but I set at least 2-3 different alarms 15 minutes apart
I don't judge
I don't know about that. We all know how Jets and Giants "fans" flip flop. Before you know it, they end up being redskins fans. 
I don't know any actuarial firms but I do know some arsonists if you go that route 
I don't know anything about golf or the accuracy of the app, but a difference of 20 yards seems like a small hill to die on
I don't know anything about this dude or of the picture gives any evidence but it's all I got
I don't know anything about your second question 
I don't know because I don't watch children's movies (assuming you are referencing the avengers)
I don't know but he's as bad as the commissioner who let Kovin keep a player despite blatantly ignoring several warnings about a keeper deadline 
I don't know but they're shutting down the app within a few months 
I don't know how a QB who averages 6.4 yards per attempt gets drafted in the first round 
I don't know how controversial this will be, but I used to love Crispix and Kix (separately, not together)
I don't know how Frankie ever emotionally recovers from this 
I don't know how Goody sleeps at night after backstabbing his friend like that
I don't know how he didn't see the LB

I don't know how it works but my parents' house is technically in a trust in my brother and my name that activates when they die?
I don't know how Kincaid doesn't catch that 
I don't know how kovin feels about his class 
I don't know how many times we have told the charter school story in the GroupMe, but it has to be at least 5 times 
I don't know how much longer I can deal with this convo before I off myself 
I don't know how much the meal I just had cost, as it was directly billed to my room, but whatever it cost was worst it 
I don't know how people are so fat. Just eat only lentils for a month. You'll drop 20% of your body weight. I guarantee it 
I don't know how that could be a euphemism but there must be something there 
I don't know how that influences your crutch cost but that's how it works 
I don't know how the colts did that but I ain't mad 
I don't know how the size of that compares to other tiny apartments 
I don't know how they are supposed to win with Goodell taking away the Pats OLine
I don't know how to respond to your kindness
I don't know how you can continue to post here after what @Joe  Bourque did 
I don't know how you can sit him after the way he played today 
I don't know how you don't like cranberries Joseph. They have a wonderful flavor profile 
I don't know how you false start on that play 
I don't know how you fucking call that. Worst flop I have ever seen 
I don't know how you sleep at night after calling that foul 
I don't know how you sleep at night after making a mistake like that l darrow. 
I don't know how you take that pitch 
I don't know how, but I think that we played a part in that win 
I don't know how, but I'm just going to assume that's a compliment 
I don't know how, in 2022, we don't have cameras on all boundaries of the endzone 
I don't know if any of you are computer gamers, so I guess most of you haven't played any of those 
I don't know if anyone has told you, but Cincinnati is in fact not in Kentucky 
I don't know if anyone told you, but Nashville is not in either northern Kentucky not Cincinnati 
I don't know if chan just brought this up because of the Facebook post 13 minutes ago but Welles' dad died 
I don't know if I could break 60, definitely not 70 
I don't know if its cool to add Julia onto that list, @Boe Jourque  please advise
I don't know if it's Marcus, becker, or goody when I get a text from you 
I don't know if I've mentioned that I am going to Italy next month yet, so I enjoyed the setting and the story was better
I don't know if John's comment was purposeful or representative of a lack of self awareness regarding the recently posted twitter tag line
I don't know if that link posted but it's a PFT article about how deangelo Williams is hurt 
I don't know if that makes sense because this is adumb project
I don't know if that's genius or a death wish
I don't know if the program director saying "I want you here on match day" means I crushed it or not. Plz confirm 
I don't know if the programs exist for non-medical school graduate students, but in 2007, there was a program that was instituted that says that doctors who graduate medical school and work for government or non-profit organizations are eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments. The catch is you need to do your residency, fellowship of applicable, and several years of being an attending while employed at an eligible institution. Most academic medical centers are non-profits, so that's a perfect career location for me so I'd be directly affected if DeVos slashes the program 
I don't know if we will all be alive in 70 years to like that comment though 
I don't know if your company has a Deborah, but happy to shit on her desk if needed 
I don't know if you're saying my team isn't garbage or just that my team is slightly less garbage than beckers. 
I don't know if you've heard, be he's out on the Wednesday Frog
I DONT KNOW JIM 
I don't know Joe, seems like a routine 0:00-seconds-50-yard-hailmary-catch-and-lateral-then-run-it in-for-a-touchdown-play-to-me 
I don't know man. He had his hands INSIDE someone's skull. What kind of person would just make up a story about being discriminated against 
I don't know man. Seems like we are losing someone new to the syndrome every week
I don't know man. They had pretty decent runs the last few years with a QB who got benched for Penix. I think KoC was working miracles 
I don't know of a single doctors office that would do that 
I don't know that I have an answer to that question...
I don't know that I should be proud of that 
I don't know that I used the word mitigate properly in that context 
I don't know that that's true but I want to believe it 
I don't know the answer to that 
I don't know the magnitude of poor testing on the denominator, but I am sure there is some degree of skew due to testing bias
I don't know the other girl who won 
I don't know this kid, but I hate him 
I don't know this man, but I think it's acceptable to wish covid upon him
I don't know what a high give is
I don't know what bs you're talking about. I get a fresh install of windows from my school and it comes with no adware or bloatware. I've had the opposite experience with iPhones. Mine get bogged down within months, the batteries die, and then the phones go. I haven't had an iPhone survive past 2.5 years 
I don't know what either of those places are 
I don't know what everyone is up to but if anyone wants to play Catan, mi casa su casa 
I don't know what happened so I'm going to read through the 140 messages I missed. Chan I will respond to you in a few minutes 
I don't know what I just liked, but I like it 
I don't know what Joe Brady (go figure, another Joe B coming up short in a big spot) is doing in the red zone 
I don't know what Joe is talking about 
I don't know what other major city that's not a shit hole exists in the Southern Hemisphere lol 
I don't know what that means
I don't know what that means 
I don't know what that's from, but I found it on my phone 
I don't know what the fuck groupme did, but now the hearts I'm giving to other people are disappearing and my app is crashing. 
I don't know what the Fuckholes are up to but if anyone wants to come over and play Catan, feel free. I selfishly don't want to go outside 
I don't know what they were trying to accomplish there 
I don't know what those are. I hope that's a compliment 
I don't know what you mean 
I don't know what you're talking about, Marcus. Darrow has been mountain biking your mom for years 
I don't know what you're talking about. I've always defended Nomar with my life 
I don't know what's worse. The pats o line or the red line southbound today. 
I don't know what's worse. Wasting $2mil or having to watch Maroon 5 play 
I don't know which is which 
I don't know who Becker or Marcus is
I don't know who Gino is....
I don't know who is worse, Peterson or Saints Oline 
I don't know who Jeff is
I don't know who Marcus is and at this point I'm afraid to ask 
I don't know who Ryan Darrow is so u vote 🐐bert
I don't know who tori is but I'm going to leave this here 
I don't know who would hate Mondays 
I don't know who Zach Allen is but he's had a few good penetrations 
I don't know why bro just autocorrected to boy but I swear I didn't mean to call you boy 
I don't know why I expected a team that already gave up 34 points to Andy Dalton to show any ability to stop the Bengals from marching right back down the field
I don't know why I keep letting him get my hopes up. They'll keep getting crushed like Marcus used to crush my boxes of cinnamon Chex 
I don't know why that would be a concern. I do know that there is an issue in DC with a lot of non-identified offers policing the protests. No indication of their department and they were refusing to say who they reported to. One reporter was even saying that the uniforms look made up - ill fitting equipment, American flag patches crooked and looking like they were glued on hastily
I don't know why you're being mean to @Skimmer right now, Jordan. 
I don't know why you're latching onto this like I'm trying to disrespect Alex Smith like he's the next JJ Watt 
I don't know why, but the dad reminded me of a cross between Bob Odenkirk and Jason Bateman 
I don't know why. I was probably working 
I don't know, 24 touchdowns to 1 interception in the finals games is a pretty good streak 
I don't know, but we are Commonwealth. Damnit. 
I don't know, Darrow gets bitches to spread pretty large all day long 
I don't know, have you seen Joe's bitmoji?
I don't know, have you seen those wrestling holds that goody puts on Marcus? And the wrestling holds that Marcus puts on Becker?
I don't know, he disappeared when the eagles needed him most 
I don't know, I don't have access to my email anymore to see what the issue is 
I don't know, I had a 0.00 era during my pitching career 
I don't know, I think they could take him at the same time
I don't know, if Becker dies, Ryan can always blame it on him being in Detroit. Legitimate excuse if you ask me 
I don't know, I'm not a judge
I don't know, I'm watching the Patriots 
I don't know, she chose to marry Marcus in the first place. Despite the requests of all of her friends, as we learned at the rehearsal dinner
I don't know, watching Chan's Jets fan friend slowly lose all hope in god last year was pretty fun
I don't know, why don't you explain Andrew.
I don't know. Austin Powers is pretty lit
I don't know. Buying memorabilia from a movie involving superheroes in tights might not be as masculine as intended 
I don't know. I feel like a top 5 QB of all time would have more juice 
I don't know. If Marcus can't take down joe, I think beckers team stands a better chance than Ryan's. And God damnit do I not want joe to win 
I don't know. This was pretty cool to see 
I don't know. What's her name. Is she single? 
I don't know. You missed the sales for it before Christmas 
I don't let my employees slack off 
I don't lie.
I don't like change 
I don't like how it's increased the size of his ego 
I don't like my dingus hanging out 
I don't like pine nuts, pecans, coconut, Brazil nuts
I don't like spreading out. Everyone needs to stop growing up and leaving. We should all move into one of the mods 
I don't like tattoos but not as opposed to them as Johnny Dash 
I don't like that @Skimmer  has not been posting
I don't like that call 
I don't like that he makes me want to watch the Ravens
I don't like that I don't get paid, and in fact, am paying to do work for other people 
I don't like that my tax dollars are funding this addiction 
I don't like that. 
I don't like the cowboys. And he's always hurt 
I don't like the patriots cutting lafell now, unless they use his cap savings (only 2mil) to sign a big free agent. They had they money to extend their core guys without cutting him, and they aren't saving additional money by cutting him before training camp. Would have been nice to give him a shot to see if he could rebound from last year. His cap hit only would have been 3.5 mil this year, not a huge investment 
I don't like the signing. He goes from getting 5-10 carries a game to coming here. He is going to be splitting carries and snaps with gray and vereen. How many carries does he expect to get? What happens when he gets pissed off here 
I don't like third year cuz I can't talk to the fuckholes enough
I don't like what the scale says so I'm going to go with "my scale is out of batteries"
I don't like what you've become.
I don't like where her head is at 
I don't like your new picture. 
I don't listen to that liberal garbage anymore 
I don't listen to the podcast for good analysis. I listen to the podcast to hear Dan's dad and listen to Marc's long anecdotes 
I don't love Bock Boi still being gone
I don't love Swift getting caught by a D lineman. Gutta get that edge more quickly 
I don't make a salary 
I don't make arguments in statues
I don't make the graphic, I just post it in hopes that it deflects the conversation away from basketball
I don't make the rules.
I don't mean to brag, but I did just beat the original Pokemon Snap 
I don't mind going to work. I enjoy my job 
I don't mind nights. I hate the flip flop back and forth, which is why it's great I chose to do that for the next 40 years of my life 
I don't need a 17-0 team being crowned as "better" than the 07 Pats 
I don't need a soap box pseudo pep talk from sexy rexy
I don't need an explanation.
I don't need anymore embarrassment 
I don't need anyone to help me plummet in the standings
I don't need to buy a ticket for daredorm. I can get porn for free 
I don't need to conform to the definition of success that society dictates for me 
I don't need to do anything 
I don't need to read an article to know how good Boston is 
I don't need to validate my hate to you 
I don't need your counter narratives right now 
I don't pay attention to his birthday events 
I don't pay attention to your views after you turned into an anti-masker who frequents family gatherings and travels for holidays 
I don't pay for Better Help though. Mental health is a liberal construct 
I don't play football but I do drink gluten free beers 
I don't pretend to understand him
I don't put too much stock in PFF but this trade seems beneficial for the pats 
I don't quite feel as strongly as Goody about the logical argument that shirt =/= bad coach. That said OAN is a piece of shit "news" network and he should be lambasted for seemingly supporting that trashfire of a company.
I don't really care about the "assholes" part. I'm sure plenty of other teams call the patriots much worse. I don't think BB and TB12 are going to be extra motivated in practice this week or are going to be more pumped up for the game next week. Everyone knows Tomlin hates the Pats because he gets "fucked over" every time they lose to us. I do love the irony of live streaming a speech saying to stay off of social media. 
I don't really care whether the government funds planned parenthood because I never really understood why it needed to be held in a different class from a normal health clinic. I just want them to exist. Not just because I believe in abortion, but because they provide birth control, test for std's, test for hiv, help with conception, etc. 
I don't really follow any college football besides BC (and barely follow that) so pardon my ignorance, but are there any stud qb's coming out of this year's draft?
I don't really know anything about BC players, so what happened? Just hat he's low on the depth chart and doesn't get many snaps?
I don't really know what that means but I guess that's cool 
I don't really remember why you're dead to me, but you are 
I don't really understand what that BB gif is supposed to mean but it's BB so I have to like it 
I don't recall anything except the GroupMe being extremely supportive of your views, despite how they might differ from some members' views.
I don't recall being invited to this dining venture
I don't recall that
I don't recall. The keeper of the 🐐list should confirm that he was already on said list 
I don't recognize any humor after this A+ joke didn't get any love 
I don't recognize any of these marble team names 
I don't recognize golf as a spot 
I don't recognize Goody's birthday as real 
I don't recognize that name 
I don't recognize that name 
I don't recognize the typos you make on purpose
I don't remember Antonio Brown being on bye when you lost to me
I don't remember inviting you here
I don't remember saying not to pick the cardinals 
I don't remember that, but I guess that explains the restraining order 
I don't remember the last time my phone rang from a spam call. 
I don't remember those occurrences because you're dead to me. 
I don't remember too much from freshman year. I blame the celiac. 
I don't remember what event got Chan redacted but I'm sure it was a totally fair and appropriate punishment
I don't remember, can you remind me?
I don't remember. Can you tell me about it? 
I don't respect him enough to know whether or not that's how you actually spell his name
I don't respond to Jeff. 
I don't respond to memes unless they are life changing
I don't restrict myself to that small of an area 
I don't see "fake thermostats for every home" in that budget
I don't see a problem with that?
I don't see a scenario where covering Allen with a linebacker on 3rd and goal makes sense
I don't see a world where a RB in an anemic offense is worth giving up $15 for next year AND Marlon Mack
I don't see an ace
I don't see any
I don't see anything about anywhere. So you have a source?
I don't see color 
I don't see cremini on that list
I don't see green texts. You see them. Not my problem
I don't see how dairy cattle judging could ever be lame 
I don't see how tax returns from 2005 even matter at this point 
I don't see lobsters on there. They are literally censoring our tweets 
I don't see nomar's face on any denomination of currency 
I don't see proof that he agreed to keep it secret 
I don't see SEA written there... 🤔
I don't see the issue 
I don't see the issue. Seems like a bad teacher
I don't see the resemblance 
I don't see tl;dr in any of your messages 
I don't see Tom Brady bringing a million n95s from China...
I don't see us going undefeated and while we haven't played another Super Bowl contender, I would argue we have outplayed some of the best "components of teams" in the league 
"I don't see why it's not as simple as:
1) PAT is blocked
2) ball bounces all the way to the opposing end zone
3) kicking team possess ball in the end zone that are defending and are tackled for a safety "
I don't shop at Stop and Shop so don't know the price comparison. It's more expensive than MB, cheaper than WF, cheaper than Shaw's
I don't sign him for one reason: Pats just proved you can win without having a dumbass player who gets suspended on your team
I don't skim. 
I don't smoke meats. Only fools like you on the bball court 
I don't stay an extra year. I get a shift reduction and get paid more during the 4th year that I already signed up for 
I don't support BC athletics unless it fits my narrative 
I don't support gambling addicts 
I don't support shooting slugs. That's animal cruelty 
I don't support the evil empire
I don't support the LIV. Or the PGA. Or the majors 
I don't support the phrase "so ick" but I agree with it's meaning 
I don't tag fake fans 
I don't take days off 
I don't take Ubers very often unless I'm traveling, but occasionally do Uber if I know I will be drinking. Unless the cost is too much, then I will take the t if that's an option 
I don't think a pandemic fits into that career plan
I don't think an 8 yard run is that significant 
I don't think Angela will have a good enough view of that from where it is
I don't think anyone actually calls it a bubbler
I don't think anyone from my team is going to help very much Kevin 
I don't think anyone in EMS wanted people to think that we were the drunk police there to get them in trouble 
I don't think anyone is being allowed home
"I don't think anyone likes women's basketball, even women. I think:
1) rousey
2) soccer
3) everything else "
I don't think anyone would debate you on that 
I don't think anything. But the whole incident made fun of Brazil as a nation. So if it's not PC to dress as a Mexican fugitive, then it shouldn't be PC to dress as a thug/stupid brazilian. I have zero problem with it, I'm just saying that it's a little hypocritical
I don't think dion Lewis is critical to the team. I think he allowed them to mask the problems they had with the offensive line. Fix those problems, and you could plug any number of backs in there with success 
I don't think errant is the right word. The best guess we had was based on other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, where infections are not necessarily prevented but symptoms are mitigated. It would be entirely irresponsible to announce that vaccines prevent infections without having the data to support that. Now that we have data, totally reasonable to retool the message 
I don't think he is a play
I don't think he makes the team this year 
I don't think he will go back to the Pats if he's trying to say BB had back channel conversations with the Giants to get Daboll hired. That's not going to help you stay in His good graces
I don't think he's as good of a fantasy option as you think he is 
I don't think he's better than @Ass Ketchum 
I don't think he's in the conversation with Rice and Moss
I don't think he's Jordan's champion, since he left Jordan to die slowly alone in the Sarlacc pit 
I don't think he's the long term answer to a team with qb issues, but I do think taking a flyer on him is well worth a second round pick, considering how cheap he is financially 
I don't think his business investments are very smart. A music service that no one wants to use. $300 designer white t shirts. He should stick to music. 
I don't think his point is to walk around calling himself a fascist
I don't think Home Depot cells bacterial diseases 
I don't think I can even keep up the schtick of saying bocker is a terrible person for traveling in that situation 
I don't think I can handle how high scoring it is 
I don't think I could find 18 gluten free donuts and amass them in one place. There probably aren't 18 gluten free donuts that exist at any given moment in the world 
I don't think I could have lost more respect for that man 
I don't think I could trust Jordan's comments from the debate. 95% chance the "facts" he reports would be incorrect 
I don't think I ever interviewed Kevin
I don't think I ever thought I would see Shelbie say "I was just here for the dick pics"
I don't think I have seen anyone do more of nothing and still put up 11 points than Stafford 
I don't think I have the ability to do much more than that 
I don't think I want Darrowball to be commissioner. I NEED Darrowball to be commissioner 
I don't think I was that smart but maybe my phone did it automatically? 
I don't think I would do a whole gf cake, that would be expensive as fuck. Maybe a groom's cake that is gf and a regular cake for everyone else?
I don't think I'm grabbing, I think my hand is just there but I honestly didn't even notice it until you pointed it out 
I don't think I'm in the minority 
I don't think in this league. Maybe two years ago? But I honestly don't remember 
I don't think it is unfair to say that if you have a smaller sample size, each game carries more weight, and that could either be a disadvantage for Reek if he has one bad game or an advantage if he has one monster game
I don't think it should be either but the rule book explicitly says you can't touch the helmet  
I don't think it was 
I don't think it was close 
I don't think it was cyrus jones? 
I don't think it will ever be big, but you have the potential to attract new fans 
I don't think it's a ludicrous idea, but I'd have to think about it more before deciding which way I would lean on that 
I don't think it's an audit, but it's a dick move. Fuck Massachusetts 
I don't think it's outlandish to want renters insurance in Boston 
I don't think it's revolutionary, but it is fun to have a game with such a big map with so many other people. The building concept of the game is meh to me, kind of Minecraft-esque which I am not big about.
I don't think I've ever cheered for an injury. I'm not that type of person 
I don't think I've gotten 220 likes total in my life 
I don't think I've not had fruity pebbles since you stole money 
I don't think Jboss has my number, so I can only assume that I would have been his first call if he did 
I don't think Marcus has ever sent me a snapchat so I don't think he ever added me back 
I don't think Markey has done anything wrong but I very much support Kennedy over him 
I don't think my opinions that French people are snobby and portions are small are untrue 
I don't think rivers in the environment covers evolution 
I don't think Russell Wilson is throwing eight touchdowns to CMichael today...
I don't think Shanny is going to take a demotion to OC 
I don't think she's a talented artist. Just a very talented marketer. 
I don't think simply making the tournament is worth trading in a championship in hockey. If you do what you were hired/recruited to do, you should win enough games to make the tournament. It's literally what you signed up for
I don't think so bocker. I've never heard them say anything about it 
I don't think so either. I don't want Angela to have to kill herself for losing to the Jets 
I don't think so, but that doesn't mean my dreams can't exist
I don't think so. I'm not being critical at all. More jealous than anything 
I don't think Stafford even knows Ebron is on his team anymore 
I don't think that Howard really has much upside after how much he's stunk up the joint this year
I don't think that one has even started 
I don't think that we are going to win this game
I don't think that you can legalize heroin without affecting other people. Like I said, crime with increase as addiction increases. A lack of clean needle programs will allow for the spread of diseases, which puts healthcare workers at risk. And businesses will lose out on productivity. I think it has too many side effects in the community to say that it won't affect others 
I don't think that you'd be able to fit that roster under that cap 
I don't think that's absurd when your goal is to get as far away from people as possible
I don't think that's true
I don't think that's true 
I don't think that's true 
I don't think that's true 
I don't think that's true 
I don't think that's true. 
I don't think the $3m he made from selling a book three years ago after Trump won puts him in the ballpark of the corporations and rich people he denounces in his campaign speeches for not paying taxes (which Bernie did) and taking advantage of workers with lower salaries.
I don't think the ball completing coming out and rolling on the ground constitutes definitive evidence 
I don't think the laces were supposed to be facing him. 
I don't think the Thompson twins should be higher than me either. They literally have bones made of glass and one of them still can't throw a punch because his shoulder is hurt 
I don't think the word dork applies. I think he's a little creepy cunt 
I don't think there is anything to say other than damn, that's fucking impressive 
I don't think they got back to the line of scrimmage 
I don't think they have wifi 
I don't think they like me...
I don't think they make anything gluten free, and if they did, I would not trust it
I don't think they understand what they're asking for when they say they want Fuckhole conversations in their groupme......
I don't think they would let you do that 
I don't think this clears up my confusion 
I don't think this is a fair matchup. Twill should win by a landslide 
I don't think undermining the federal, state, and local responses to a global pandemic should bar you from getting a vaccine. You just shouldn't take a vaccine from someone who spent the last 9 months actually saying COVID is real. Back of the line with you 
I don't think Walsh needed to even bring up the idea of a curfew because it obviously has a more severe connotation that what the "curfew" is going to do. He is upset because people are congregating at night and not social distancing
I don't think we need a receiver. How about a fucking o lineman who isn't injured 
I don't think we she capable of being that violent goody
I don't think we should cancel student debt. I think we should cancel my student debt though 
I don't think you can concuss your ass 
I don't think you can have an accurate score without knowing hair color 
I don't think you can say that a certain subset of the population gets affordable healthcare while another doesn't. A good portion of the 5% are using so many healthcare resources because they were unlucky enough to have a severe condition or accident at no fault of their own. Just because someone was diagnosed with a glioblastoma doesn't mean that should be forced to choose between chemotherapy and crippling debt or a quick death less debt. 
I don't think you have a grasp on the amount of essential healthcare that is delivered in a developed country
I don't think you know what "fucked up" means 
I don't think you know what nomading is 
I don't think you know what that word means 
I don't think your rehab program is enough to save him. We need to get him addicted to meth so then he forgets all about fantasy football 
I don't think you're actually sorry, Bocker 
I don't trouble myself with fake sports 
I don't trust anyone other than Dan Hanzus, Underdog Media Insider 
I don't trust anything on Reddit. I trust people I talk to in person 
I don't trust him on any other non-KOC led offense 
I don't trust the current leadership to get the right weapons
I don't understand any of these whistles or penalties 
I don't understand how you're saying he's a stud 
I don't understand that joke but I'm just going to smile and nod 
I don't understand the appeal. I've seen some of the tiny house builder shows (Olivia's family likes that kind of tv) and I don't think I could tolerate living in such a small space with someone else 
I don't understand the euphemism 
I don't understand the issue
I don't understand the issue. Unity with the Fuckholes. Not the girls.
I don't understand what is so hard to get
I dont understand what the Packers are
I don't understand what the Rams are
I don't understand what you are referencing 
I don't understand where this hype is coming from
I don't understand. Mayor Walsh offered to meet with them several times and the leader of the protests declined, saying she wanted to make things to bad that the mayor would have to call and beg her to meet 
I don't understand. The Patriots are playing in the only game that matters today. Why are you acknowledging unimportant games
I don't use uber so I can save money to pay my student loans 
I don't use umbrellas. They are a sign of weakness 
I don't want anyone to end up on a ventilator but.....
I don't want anyone to have a false negative but....
I don't want logic right now
I don't want refugees. I think we need to build a wall 
I don't want Ryan to murder me, can't do it
I don't want the numbers anymore 
I don't want to be responsible for my professors having a heart attack
I don't want to be that guy, but I would rather quit the league than pay $100 up front, let alone just paying $70 for a punishment
I don't want to distract him from winning super bowls 
I don't want to go somewhere that I have to take malaria prophylaxis and get vaccinated for yellow fever and take probiotics so I don't end up with gastro 
I don't want to go to Maine
I don't want to go to work tomorrow. I miss quarantine.
I don't want to have to calculate that shit myself. I want it in real time
I don't want to paint a negative picture about her character, but she was quite liberal about the favors she offered. Especially while she was dating someone else. I believe she asked one of my other friends if she could blow him on New Years when his girlfriend was in the other room. Power move 
I don't want to shit myself as I'm dying. What a degrading way to go 
I don't want to some punk ass kid who gets murdered in season 4 episode 2. I ain't about that life 
I don't want to talk to you 
I DONT WANT YOUR KINDNESS 
I don't want your likes, slimmer 
I don't watch as much soccer as I used to, but I think it has the worst overtime rules in sports (and that's saying a lot since football overtime isn't great). 1) I hate not having golden goal 2) penalty kicks are the worst way to determine the outcome of an important game
I don't watch shows about dudes' wieners 
I don't watch the office and I know the reference 
I don't watch videos but I assume it's the phase 2 based out of Cambridge 
I don't watch videos in groupme 
I don't watch videos in or out of the GroupMe 
I don't watch videos in the gorupme
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
I don't watch videos in the groupme but know that scene very well and will throw you a like
I don't watch videos in the GroupMe, but even if I did, I would not click on a tiktok link
I don't watch videos of support X, but if I did, I would be so frustrated at his inability to open that box
I don't watch videos outside of the GroupMe
I don't watch/read things that are posted in here
I don't wish any ill will against the guy, I just don't like being wrong 
I don't, Jamie retweeted it. Any Twitter user (tweeter?) that doesn't follow jboss should just shut there account down now 
I don't. 
I don't. Can you explain it
I don't. Fuck him
I don't. I just want everyone to know he sucks 
I don't. It gives the GroupMe quality content 
I don't. Put in players who can play.
I doubt any LA fans actually care about this game 
I doubt he's even in Boston 
I doubt his welfare-collecting ass is awake yet 
I doubt I will be invited. Don't worry Goody, we can have our own wedding, with hookers and blackjack
I doubt it 
I doubt it's accurate but I heard someone suggest mccourty might slide back down and get some looks 
I doubt that the Eagles team represents the Harvard of quarterback school
I doubt you'll be on the flight because you probably showed up 45 minutes late 
I downloaded that but never started it. Maybe I'll take a crack at it 
I drafted him for 20 something. So it will be whatever that was +10
I drank the cool aid. 
I drink orgain plant protein powder every morning, but I don't drink it on weekends to try to save money. But I'm running low now and Amazon is either out of stock or stopped selling it and I'm devastated 
I drive a car made in America because these colors don't run 
I drive to the bucket and get Horford to foul if I am Jimmy
I dropped a massive one in the old porcelain throne today
I dropped him from two leagues. What does that say about me 
I dropped the ball on the rice krispie treats but I will make up for it with the gluten free cookies on 12/24
I drove past a Ross store in Florida. It looked appropriately shitty, given who we know who works there....
I drove past this bringing a patient to UMass the other day 
I dunno I heard he kicked your ass 
I dunno. Jordan isn't here so I was trying to fill in for him with the only political thing I knew about off the top of my head 
I eat a lot healthier, but when I find junk food that I can actually eat, I splurge 
I eat any steak medium rare. Burgers medium. Less "common" meats, will eat chef's choice 
I eat dairy 
I educate myself with south park 
I emphatically agree. My argument is that now is not the time to change how you review drugs. 
I emphatically denounce this, something CT won't do
I employed by the federal government
I ended up forgetting to buy the subscription and happened to log in the other night and there were tons of appointments 
I endorse an increase in defense spending so we can give @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco a raise
I enjoy coffee health bar too, which makes me feel like a 70 year old 
I enjoy JBucks
I enjoy shrimp. 
I enjoy that despite the Middle East about to be blown to middle earth, the GroupMe is still focusing on the important issues like burying some athlete on Twitter
I enjoy that Harmon just murdered someone on the end of that pick 
I enjoy that thong 
I enjoy that Tom Brady is a human who exists. 
I enjoy the phrase "chode muffin" very much 
I enjoy things that Bocker enjoys 
I enjoy your company. Just less than my fiance 
I enjoyed competing against you Chan. You're a great friend and an even better competitor 
I enjoyed her time in the groupme
I enjoyed it
I enjoyed staying at Atlantis when I was 11. 
I enjoyed that trivia question 
I enjoyed White Lotus 
I envisioned a close game with more points 
I especially don't like that call 
I even care about what clothing they wear
I even got here early enough to check my bag and when I was boarding, I got a confirmation email that my bag had made it on the plane. Talk about great customer service 
I even read every post by @The Big Dick Bandit 
I even tagged you so you'd be sure not to skim 
I evolved my kakuna into a beedrill and caught a 287 pidgeotto, excited to see what evolves into 
I exclusively wear sweat pants and scrubs. If you wear dress clothes, lose my number 
I expect a response almost as much as I expect Jamie to take the SATs
I expect lavish gifts to try and convince me to rejoin. Of course none of it will work.
I expect our 3s to be anyone else’s starters 
I expected you to support fitzmagic. My point still stands. 
I fail to see any connection between posting a picture of a white board and posting a novel about patients I treated 
I feel a Kyle rudolf touchdown right here 
I feel bad because I like him as a person and he was an incredible pitching coach when he was with us but not a good manager with Toronto or Boston. 
I feel bad for ever bashing this lifestyle 
I feel bad for Jimmy G 
I feel bad for Kovin. He has both starting QBs on bye and his only QB now is CJ Beat-hard
I feel bad for scapegoating Kinsler, especially since he's a gold glove nominee this year, but I can't say I am disappointed that he's not in the lineup tonight.
I feel bad for Steve Wilks 
I feel bad for the Bourque brothers. No way Ryan or I lose tonight. 
I feel bad for the competent people they passed over for this position 
I feel bad for the person missing out on Chipotle day 
I feel bad for Tito 
I feel bad for Tony after all the effort he's put in 
I feel bad that Tom has to play with such scrub receivers like Evans and AB when Mac gets undrafted phenoms Meyers and Wilkerson 
I feel bad we pretty much murdered hoyer and ruined Texans chances at making the playoffs 
I feel better about myself 
I feel better now
I feel confident with my easy access to a literal house in the middle of the woods
I feel dirty even posting a BBT gif 
I feel empty inside, but that's my normal baseline
I feel entirely neutral about that
I feel fine
I feel infinitely less confident. 
I feel it 
I feel left out of this pool 
I feel left out. GroupMe didn't tell me that Marcus left or came back so I can't leave my impact on his like ratio 
I feel less dumb 
I feel like #2 is a very personal question
I feel like @Witness is the only candidate, but has anyone listened to the planet money on Patty van Winkle bourbon 
I feel like 69% of the stuff that happened in both seasons 1 and 2 of The Rehearsal should not be allowed but what a quality production. I’m here for the conspiracy theories 
I feel like 90% of people with podcasts shouldn't have podcasts 
I feel like AJB could have made more of an effort there. It looked like he didn't look back to find the ball until it was too late to adjust 
I feel like all sports need to ditch guaranteed contracts. 
I feel like any type of routine prenatal care could have avoided that situation months in advance 
I feel like as an agent, thats the first thing you tell your client to do 
I feel like buying tickets shouldn't be that hard but I guess I can't expect much from anyone other than myself 
I feel like Caserio would pick Flores. McCown seems like an Easterby pick 
I feel like chan needs more support from the anti patriots crowd. Marcus and Becker and really leaving you to fend for yourself 
I feel like defensive holding should be 5 yards and replay down instead of an automatic first. 
I feel like eating there increases my chances of dying by suicide bomb 
I feel like education has become a very diluted field. 
I feel like Emyr is ignoring some other good comments in this thread and is jumping to support Bocker 
I feel like every year there is a news story about the new "gluten vaccine in phase 2/3 trials" 
I feel like Frankie's news is overwhelming my vacation announcement
I feel like Fronkie doesn't know the loading dock story
I feel like goody was on the "NO WFH 4EVER" early on in the pandemic but I am too lazy to prove it
I feel like Goody's fandom started as a joke and now he has become a wnba convert 
I feel like he should be able to afford new contacts 
I feel like he's a more effective communicator and isn't older than the t rex skeleton at the museum of science 
I feel like he's been around forever 
I feel like he's going for an immediate turnaround so he can get another SB before he dies
I feel like I am owed $5 for poor friendship
I feel like I can drop my homer facade and say this: Tom Brady was generally aware of a scheme to deflate footballs .1-.3 psi below the allowed limit 
I feel like I complain about people not covering Gronk in the seam every week 
I feel like I got fucked over by not being in the playoffs. If my team had more to play for, I think I woulda had a shot to win
I feel like I got the score that I was aiming for. We will see 
I feel like I have a Goody nose in those.
I feel like I have a positive record in the departments of moral victories and friendship. 
I feel like I have to explain the typo so a Thompson twin doesn't comment on it
I feel like I know the name but can't figure out where I recognize it from
I feel like I missed a completely boring and lame Sunday of football while I was busy saving lives 
I feel like I probably have posted something about a non-white rapper in the past, but I have no way of proving that, so I guess you win
I feel like I remember him eating Mac and cheese but maybe I'm wrong 
I feel like I remember that she was a theater kid 
I feel like I should still be allowed to answer. Yes. 
I feel like I'm being cyber bullied right now. Tiger woods is going to be so fucked when I hire Emyr to sue him 
I feel like I'm entering a hostile environment whenever I post in there. I expect to be shunned 
I feel like I'm experiencing the exact same level of pain as Jordan right now 
I feel like I'm going to be labeled a skimmer, but do I win my money back for 3rd place in this league? 
I feel like I'm required to say something given my disdain for espn and my public health degree candidacy 
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills right now. 
I feel like interviews like these have been posted many times. It's disgusting but no one on the right (read: Goody) is concerned by how insane this guy is
I feel like it has been discussed 
I feel like it was noon and 9 pm but I could be making that up
I feel like it’s gotten better. But I will say that if I have something important I need, like food for company coming over or for a special dinner at home, I’ll go to the store on my own 
I feel like it's a baseball manager. They choose to coach and implement specific strategy and they determine the lineup/when to sub, etc. But the players still have to play 
I feel like it's easier to go into a season with no expectations for your team than to feel like your team has to win a championship every year for a season to be successful
I feel like John gruden is a huge Star Wars fan 
I feel like Jordan's Jeopardy skills would make him quick on the buzzer to start the round off
I feel like Joseph is being a bit sarcastic 
I feel like maybe that sounds familiar
I feel like Mo Vaughn is still getting paid by the mets
I feel like more people should want to come to the Pats for that very reason 
I feel like most people at least have heard of Khan. Maybe not in the detail of him pillaging and raping women across Asia to the point where like 2 billion people are his descendants, but I feel like it's reasonable to expect someone to recognize his name 
I feel like my first amendment rights are being violated 
I feel like of animosity towards Kevin so that makes us good rivals 
I feel like Osborne, Australia is a thing that exists 
I feel like playoffs are almost exclusively for entertainment value. They raise the income for the leagues immensely. 
I feel like promises were made during the election cycle that weren't kept when you took over as commissioner. 
I feel like resourceful players may find away to make magnetism beneficial for them 
I feel like rock climbing basketball would be pretty dope 
I feel like that goal was not representative of how wild the whole game was. Seemed like a simple wrist er 
I feel like that's a great answer 
I feel like that's exactly what basketball needs to be more relevant. I know I would watch if more people were jumping through the air and kneeing people 
I feel like that's not a long time or very fruitful 
I feel like the chefs in that image are not safe
I feel like there should be a better use for drafted players than the D league where no one ever seems to ascend to the NBA 
I feel like there were opportunities for you to act as an extension of the beloved commissioner and draft a list for league approval
I feel like they had more run on first to throw out to Saquon 
I feel like they paid Macklemore like $10k more than his asking price 
I feel like this directly comparable to Lapoint/Lapointe
I feel like this is a trap
I feel like this is exactly what we’ve complained about several times in here 
I feel like this is the Colts getting Philip Rivers 
I feel like this might have been mentioned last night, but apparently Cambridge is voting tonight whether to close dine in services 
I feel like this was mostly freshman year before we starting acknowledging that you existed 
I feel like tomorrow is the perfect day for Morcus to run a marathon. Don't you guys think
I feel like ur beautiful tho
I feel like we have to elect a president that is easily satirized by snl 
I feel like we just talked about this last week?
I feel like we missed a big opportunity 
I feel like we've had this discussion 
I feel like we've talked about it in the groupme before so I want to call @#JustFacts✅ but I may be making that conversation up. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt 
I feel like whenever someone skims, there is a 69% chance that they are skimming Chan
I feel more tired after spin than running five miles. I don't go anymore because I no longer am a member at the gym I used to frequent, as it was tied to my employment 
I feel proud knowing that my quarterback handed the ball off to your running back 
I feel quite dumb, but I see no shared tab. Is it possible I disabled this? 
I feel raw and I think I’m bleeding now. You really put a beat down on me 
I feel smarter now. Thank you.
I feel strongly that I miss our good friend @bockbot
I feel terrible for Hurts
I feel terrible for Joe's parents. They probably are wondering where they went wrong right about now
I feel that Brady is persecuted to a a greater degree than cam newton 
I feel the love 
I feel the same way about this show as I feel about JJ Watt
I feel this in my soul 
I feel unique in predicting that he would be a busy before the draft, even though half the country thought that way too. Just ESPN hyped him so much that not I hate him 
I feel validated. The poll on instagram was overwhelmingly for waffles
I feel very passionate about this sport that I have not watched once this season 
I feel worse about my team 
I feel worse for brown than our team 
I feel worse for the network crew that had to miss Christmas for this game. 
I feel your pain, Chan. I was sexually assaulted by Goody in front of my significant other. Now I can never be in the same room alone with Goody without having a crippling panic attack 
I feel your pain. ASMB does not rest for any social media injustice 
I fell asleep during both slumdog and no country for old me. 
I felt bad for Kovin obvious 
I felt bad for starting Matty Ice but Marcus made me feel better about myself
I felt it in my bones 
I felt it necessary to read to understand counterarguments in order to have a better informed discussion
I felt like @Boe Jourque for a second there
I felt like I was watching a soft core porn. And not a good one 
I felt so bad for letting bocker down that I went for a 3 mile walk and then climbed for an hour 
I felt that one all the way from here 
I fight for truth and justice. If that gets me on the 🐩 list, so be it 
I figure any republican candidate these days will be officially anti-gay marriage. I know Cruz is an evangelical Christian so i can guess what he would try to do should he be in office. I am a firm believe in marriage equality, having had someone in my life who was here legally almost get deported before the Supreme Court ruling for equal marriage rights. So not only do I believe that the law should exist the way it is now, I don't want a president to come in and spend his first 3 years trying to reverse every decision that was made during Obama's terms 
I figured Frankie already knew that
I figured it would be to win outright, but figured I would just double check before committing to my pick 
I figured out what the trade exemption they got from the Gordon sign and trade meant without even asking the GroupMe
I figured that. But like what are they 
I figured the fallout from PETA if the question didn't pass would be so annoying, I couldn't justify voting no 
I figured the rest was from him being shitfaced 
I figured we weren't doing anything anyway so I'm at Sowa
I figured you did but was giving you the benefit of the doubt and highlighting the fact that Becker was wrong 
I figured you would have realized that when you saw stop and shop meat in their store 
I find ^ attractive 
I find his fudge packing annoying 
I find it hard to believe that you haven't beaten it in your old car. I've beat it in there twice since I woke up this morning 
I find it really difficult to objectively like Morcus Bauer 
I find that comment racist. Goody hates Africans and Jews 
I find that post offensive
I find their season long ratings to be more accurate than individual games.  But yeah I mostly agree with your point 
I fixed it
I fixed them
I follow none of those rules and thus am unsuccessful
I followed up my performance last week, where I had the #2 highest score, with the highest score of the week this week 
I for one am very stimulated rn
I for one didn't like the call
I for one have no idea why the ball isn't getting traced 
I for one plan to watch the game from Becker's old apartment. 
I for one support Marcus's inclusion in the list of past champions 
I for whatever reason suck in our league but perform much better in my other one. Joe had the pleasure of knocking me out this year though 
I forget the title but there is a book by a German author written in 1925 that's supposed to be pretty revolutionary
I forget when. @Marcus Bauer, need an assist here 
I forget who they were talking about, but one of the podcasts I just started listening to said that someone from DHS or the state department was getting being told about the existence of the EO as he was watching Trump sign the EO on live tv. 
I forget, let me look back 
I forgive you. El pres popped one for the challenge yesterday. And I do agree with chan that that's an unfair advantage 
I forgot about Goody saying that Adam Gase was the second best coach in the league
I forgot about him. Good call goody 
I forgot about HQ trivia
I forgot about that 
I forgot about that lady
I forgot about the penalty
I forgot about the punishment. Thought John was supposed to fulfil his punishment during the reunion fun run 
I forgot about your Cleveland circle apartment 
I forgot Angela went to such a shitty Florida school that glorifies the decimation of a Native American tribe 
I forgot Fitzmagic was even still in the league 
I forgot how hard working out is. Now I remember why I hate it 
I forgot that Joe’s sub-4 hour marathon finish gave him the right to tear you down, Anthony. 
I forgot that waivers were a thing 
I forgot we don't vet anyone or have border control 
I forgot what time he was scheduled for and got v nervous about him meeting you guys for food this morning instead of golfing 
I forgot. Could you remind me?
I found an orange. Thanks for your help buddy 
I found goody 
I found Jelle's marble runs because John Oliver sponsored a marble tournament during the pandemic when it was the only form of competitive entertainment. Bocker hates John Oliver. Bocker hates marble racing. It makes sense 
I found Joff's burner reddit account
I found mine on trulia 
I found Nick's new obsession (after he forgets about AOC):
I found out today that I am not immune to mumps. So I need to get the mmr vaccine again 
I found that Bojack got funnier for me as the series went along, until season 6 where it was less about being funny and more about realistically telling a story about how shitty life can be. Season 1 is definitely the weakest from a story and writing perspective
I found that her personality is very similar to other dramatic podcasts I've listened to. Agree to disagree because you're wrong
I found that out after getting on the t too. Had to walk from Kendall to Bowdoin because there were no shuttles at Kendall when I got there 
I found the answer. Was really confused looking at the championship history, but I didn't realize there was no championship game before 2004
I found the three people responsible for Covid-19*
I found the two people responsible for Covid-19
I found this out over and over again with rentals over the last few years. And I don't love love this house, but I really like it. There will be others if this doesn't work
I friend other people every few weeks or so. Not too often 
I fucked up and went to Howl first, then Ned Devine's
I fucked up the joke. Time to commit seppuku
I fucked up. That's my bad. I was thinking back to your visit to the Avengers Campus but was thinking it was a star wars themed trip 
I fucking hate Goodell
I fucking love amendola. 
I fucking love my 9ersss
I fucking need a James Develin jersey 
I fucking suck
I fully believe that a team down the draft would leak that to hurt his draft stock. Happens every year
I fully expect Wentz to put him in the lead and Jimmy Graham only putting up 3 yards on 8 targets 
I fully recognize the bias. I do, however, appreciate that the people they bring on as guests to talk to are actual politicians who served/serve in office and not pundits who get paid to talk about politics. That said, it's been about a year since I listed to one of their podcasts so that may have changed as they got bigger
I fully support baseball conversation. Also the NFL draft would be a great topic of conversation 
I gave a serious answer
I gave a serious answer 
I gave myself my own haircut today. I'm actually pretty proud 
I gave Nick a taste of my amaro spritz at Barcelona after Bocker's wedding and he was not impressed. I'm a big fan tho
I gave up that game. I'm onto NYT crosswords now 
I gave you a whole bag of leftover Halloween candy?
I generally drink with everyone in my office too. I'm the only one in the office. I drink alone. At work. 
I generally just think about being kidnapped by Candice Swaenpoel and Gigi Hadid, for the sole purpose of having a four day sex bender where our only sustenance is lentils 
I generally wait until Emyr reacts to any racist comments before I pass judgement on them/throw any likes 
I genuinely appreciate you sharing your knowledge and helping me understand. However, I still maintain my 🔥 take 
I get all the games I would get with cable, plus RedZone 
I get called worse while just walking through my ED 
I get confused
I get groceries delivered from the Chelsea market basket to Southie 
I get home Saturday evening and then I go back to ignoring that you guys exist 
I get it. Because he’s Asian so you have flaming Asian food 
I get it. Like the social media trend 
I get it. that's funny because his nickname is Fitzmagic, implying that he knows magic, and curses fall under the umbrella of magic
I get mine in 7 hours. It's gonna be lit
I get significantly delayed at least once every two weeks 
I get sluggish at this point now but I like to think that 75% of the reason why I drink coffee is that I like how it tastes
I get that a lot
I get that Bernie sees himself as an outsider, but it mixes the message when he's giving his own response when by all accounts, Kennedy's response went really well
I get that pun 
I get that reference
I get that reference 
I get that reference because I don’t skim 
I get that same text every 4 days or so 
I get that you’re a bitch 
I get the impression that Joseph and Bocker have done this trivia question together, and Joseph is abstaining from answering. Which leads me into my next theory, that Joseph and Bock Boi are doing trivia at a bad somewhere in North Dakota
I get the reference
I get the reference now
I get the reference^
I get the sense that Chan holds resentment for Bocker and me with which he lashes out when he is the target of jokes in the goruome
I get the sense that it would make you feel good about yourself if I said yes, so......no
I get to make and eat buffalo chicken dip for my potluck, so I'm pretty pumped 
I get very seasick 
I get yelled at and you invite Joe to go golfing
I glad I said I wasn't coming 
I go to many places in southie...
I go to western mass to pick apples 
I googled "fantasy football team names". I picture of Ha-Ha Clinton-Dix popped up. I put the name together from there. However, I'm 99% sure that if I opened the article, it would have come up with the same name 
I googled it but would otherwise not know what that is 
I googled it. It says goody is a bitch 
I got 5 jabs
I got a guy to maybe consider going to AA on Monday. #lifechange #makeadifference #addictionisreal #medstudentsmatter #patientsfirst #bethechangeyouwanttoseeintheworld
I got a like from Bocker on instagram. This is a momentous day 
I got a lot of uncommon ones last night but only when I was sitting in the park with the lures. Everything at my apartment or on the way to work is either a pidgey or a drowzee
I got a notification that you liked my post, and came back in to see what you liked. It was at that time that I noticed that you removed Joseph. But #NotOurNarrative
I got an alert from Yahoo (my other league) telling me not to start Chubb because the Ravens D was gunna shut him down. 
I got asked plenty of questions that were challenging and tested how I think without asking me some obscure riddle 
I got at least another 3-4 years before I even start talking about it. Both Olivia and I want to get established, at least marginally, in our careers before it is even on our radar
I got biden
I got Bocker a low paying summer internship so I basically am worthless 
I got confused because they are both old white guys 
I got el pelon at bc after the race
I got five or six in half an hour 
I got fooled into thinking the video was a picture
I got half way through reading that and was going to call you out for making the CEO a man. Then I finished your post and realized that you covered your tracks. 
I got him back 
I got in a total masshole style argument over a parking space this morning. Got called racist. Was awesome 
I got it for the sole purpose of reading and watching video. It's perfect for me for that but it's awful if you're using it for any school or work related purpose 
I got just over 50%. I think I got asked about 4 or 5 neighborhoods that were separated by 3% or less, which I thought made it very difficult
I got lunch and he didn't. Who is really throwing who off of the cage in a steel cage shutes and ladders match 
I got married two years ago 
I got my calendar wrong. I am scheduled to get the booster in 2 weeks when I have 3 days off to be a bitch about how much my body aches 
I got my second vaccine today 
I got nothing against Mahomes yet. Give it a year or two
I got nothing but balls on the mind 
I got out at the Chanel question because why would I know about women’s fashion, Joseph? 
I got out on HQ #6
I got punched in the face just the other day 
I got so bored of being so great at Halo, that now I am running train on AI in Starcraft
I got so fooled on that Mookie hit. I would have told you it was on the Pike
I got so many snacks that I don't plan to share with you guys 
I got some messages to read 
I got some more work to do between apartments but I would like to schedule my time around fuckhole plans, if they are being made 
I got stuck at Porter going for 20 minutes last night before I gave up and walked home in the rain. Some crazy dude was trying to jump on the tracks at Park, and it somehow prevented my outbound train from getting me home. I think it took close to 45 minutes for trains to start back up again  
I got tests the next week. I’ll be incommunicado 
I got that Jordan did Morcus's list so that's all that matters
I got that much. What I don't know is how to figure out what they are 
I got that one 
I got the "I want to still be friends," then she texted me throughout fall semester our sophomore year, and then boom, blocked 
I got the color first! Y'all suck
I got the joke 
I got the joke 
I got the joke, and then I second guessed myself when no one else got it so I didn't say anything 
I got the poker question wrong. Bocker would hate me 
I got the reference
I got the same email earlier 
I got to #4
I got up to get more pancakes and missed the touchdown boooooo
I got very confused there 
I got your back Jordan 
I gotcha
I gotcha buddy
I gotta live through you
I greatly prefer the bike over the treadmill 
I grind so hard that I'm going to be driving into the storm
I guarantee that the only two people who say “have a catch” in here are Bock and Morcus which tells you all you need to know about who is right 
I guarantee you do unless you live under a rock 
I guess #JustFacts✅ doesn't love me
I guess as a pats fan, I don't count the wild card as part of the playoffs. Season starts at the conference championship round 
I guess at that point, Goody would have been asleep for two hours already
I guess Becker has decided we are no longer important to him since he's gone to med school. We should give his team to Emily again 
I guess Bock has to either help Jordan move or fake his own death and leave the GroupMe/his wife/his current life forever 
I guess don't understand the question 
I guess Duke's premature anointment was a False Flagg
I guess fuck me for being interested in my friend's research
I guess Gase was right, he did have a bad hamstring 
I guess he struggles to evaluate manager talent as much as he struggles to evaluate player talent
I guess he was literally and figuratively an asshole nurse 
I guess he's going to....wig out...at this decision 
I guess I am just not an asshole
I guess I assumed that the school would be paying UA for athletics gear, but is it the other way around? Or is UA just giving out so many discounts to schools that it contracts with that they are no longer profitable? 
I guess I can take solace in the fact that I hate all of you. And that I won Pats tickets today. Fuck all of you
I guess I can understand that. All my neighbors growing up had oil, while my house had gas, so the trucks were always on my street as a kid 
I guess I did not RC 
I guess I feel the same way about basketball as John does about football 
I guess I have to make a pick em league now.....
I guess I just assumed that since Becker and Ryan's dad were surgeons, your dad would be too 
I guess I just put more effort and focus into my workouts than you 
I guess I should go buy my advanced showing tickets to Boo 2: A Madea Halloween then 
I guess I shouldn't assume her gender. The DMV probably doesn't accurately list people's identities on their drivers licenses 
I guess I stopped paying attention to the dolphins are the pats eviscerated them on Thursday night football, Japanese style 
I guess I won the Charles-off. Did anyone else bid?
I guess I won't trust Adam schefters description of medical status going forward 
I guess I’ll start: “poor people don’t deserve to be taxed more because they’re poor” 
I guess I’m deleting your number 
I guess ignoring Joe Judge, who is actually the most recent coordinator turned head coach
I guess I'm just chopped liver for texting you directly
I guess I'm starting a starting running back then 
I guess I'm thinking of every injury, not just season ending injuries, but it feels like a lot of the biggest players have missed some time this season 
I guess it doesn't help when it closes at 11 pm and the only time I've been, our group was booked for 9 pm...
I guess it’s an articulate sentence 
I guess it's confirmed hat Kanye is indeed a gay fish 
I guess Jabril's lawyer wasn't lying 
I guess Jimmy G throwing hospital balls is how to stop Deebo
I guess Joe and I are the only ones who care about the awful kicker scoring that our commissioner set up
I guess just always try and be nice to people and try not to piss anyone off and then you won’t be invited 
I guess just mine and Emyr's 
I guess kovin will have to tell his patients that they're going to go without adequate medical care so we can make the draft at 4pm to not interfere with tour sleep patterns 
I guess lebron is a homer too 
I guess no one loves me
I guess not much of a geographical move but I'm going to ignore that fact
I guess not the video as much as the article that went along with it. I think it was Washington post 
I guess NSFW to my post above 
I guess people just really don't want to give up those new iPhones 
I guess really anywhere there is a moderately sized college campus, there is a market for uber and a bunch of potential drivers. 
I guess saying something is work $X makes it so. Guys, it's $5000 to stay in the GroupMe
I guess scoring a goal in the intrasquad soccer scrimmage when the other team didn’t show up is a highlight 
I guess since a small plate of crackers is all that gluten free people can eat, I can't make buffalo chicken dip for you anymore
I guess so....
I guess some of the nearby towns are now bracing for action overnight. The posts I was reading were from a few hours ago so not sure how it has evolved since then 
I guess Steph isn't voting for DeSantis either 
I guess Taysom Hill is not a good qb. Who would have thought?
I guess that means you're either incredibly strong-willed or a huge pussy for working there so long and not killing yourself Darrow 
I guess that really.....Hurts the Eagles Super Bowl chances
I guess that's accurate 
I guess that's the consolation you get for having to live near the shooty part of town 
I guess that's why Joe is the #JokeMaster
I guess the answer is yes 
I guess the lesson to take out of this is don't eat at chipotle
I guess the man that Sanchez tried to pick a fight with was a 70 year old 
I guess the next step is to figure out how much Becker and Joe are going to have to contribute to get this off of the ground. My conservative estimates put our fundraising goal at 1.7 billion 
I guess the proper grammar would be “Bocker and his optimize have doomed BC”
I guess the rule of thumb is never trade your players. 50/50 chance someone gets hurt for the year 
I guess the time I volunteered to help call voters in GA for the Dem candidates, only to block the phone number of the organization because I didn't actually feel like doing it, really helped out tonight
I guess this is as good a time as ever, given our speculation of current virus trend projections, to announce that Olivia and I are pushing our wedding celebration back until 5/21/22. It seems unlikely that everything will be shored up by May 2021, and Vermont is one of the strictest states for travel. We will still get married but will likely be with just close family.
I guess this is how you're being repaid for showing hospitality to Becker. You let him stay in your apartment, he takes pictures of everything he finds in your room when you're not homeboy
I guess Trey Flowers too. He is not a cornerback
I guess tyrod is a slippery bitch and they have 0.5 wide receivers 
I guess Vollmer was always reliable whereas Cannon had some really rough seasons in years 1 and 2
I guess we will see over the next few weeks 
I guess we will wait and see
I guess we’ll never know if @Nick D has the hardest work. He’s not allowed to post about it 
I guess what I'm asking is if UFC has exhibition fights that don't mean anything. Or are all their fights for a title/belt? For example, soccer has exhibition matches that don't count towards any tournament or league. 
I guess you can consider him a 🐐 for not killing himself by now 
I guess you can say that anyone flying to Florida is a piece of shit 🤔
I guess you could say, the Jags just brought Big Ben....to Church...
I guess you see who your friends really are
I guess you were in it too 
I guess you're highlighting the difference in market and culture, not relating to team movement 
I guess, like, congrats on running a marathon JBoss
I guess, on the bright side, at least the place actually exists?
I guessed octopi but the answer was octopuses 
I gutta get back in the swing so @#ObeyYourThirst and I can save the galaxy
I gutta make some trades. Can't have Suh being the cornerstone of my line anymore

I had a bad day because I didn't walk into the hospital while greeted with applause
I had a classmate in high school whose last name was Mendelssohn. He was kind of a dick and then he got rejected by all the Ivy League schools, so karma got the best of him 
I had a classmate Jasper in med school 
I had a conversation about Georgia o'Keefe paintings at work a few months ago. A coworker walked in half way through the conversation and said she loved her paintings and had two or three at home. She had zero clue that her paintings were all of vaginas 
I had a golduck and now a Pinsor run away from me today. 
I had a good thing going last night until you fucked my team over by calling an early win. Now I probably have hypertension and am doomed to have heart failure by age 40. Guess I have to respect the long con
I had a guy break out salmon poke that he bought at LAX after we landed in BOS. At least 5 hours later...

I had a list of things I wanted to do today on Olivia's day off but it is way too cold to do any of them 
I had a miscommunication with my "barber" and the top of my hair got shortened from a 7 to a 1.5. Tough look for the haircuts-at-home club

I had a student account from sophomore year of high school until I turned 23. I got a letter in the mail saying I was going to be charged $12/month and my account was being converted to a regular checking account. I'm not happy that I'm the only one incurring this charge 
I had a very diverse upbringing. Melrose even used to bus in black students for us!
I had already been asleep for an hour when you posted this
I had already forgotten 
I had an arnold palmer today, so basically I am a Masters superman 
I had an attending on internal medicine who used to say "living the dream" every single day. I think it's creeping past the cubicle walls
I had an income last year
I had an internal debate about whether I would Americanize it or not. I chose to go with the unintelligent choice. And for that, go fuck yourself. 
I had an iPhone in 2010
I had anatomy lab from 10-12 and missed 0 messages in the groupme. 
I had back to back peds patients in the ED third year who showed up for"abdominal pain" after their mothers stopped their miralax because "they weren't constipated anymore" 
I had been saying for months that I was retired. Not my fault you couldn't find a replacement
I had blood tests two months after diagnosis, my tTG went from 75 to 35 (normal is <15), and that was being semi-compliant. So it definitely takes a long time 
I had Chipotle-Away handy
I had classics plus got a bag of trolli sour gummy worms and two bags of albanese gummy bears. They were definitely more popular

I had not 
I had not seen a single tiger king meme but I know what it is 
I had not seen this as I didn't watch the game but boy was this awful 
I had one friend comment on how short it was yesterday. He laughed when I told him the story but tried to convince me that it looked "fine." I luckily am not scheduled to work until Friday so I have some time to silently weep to myself while knitting the discarded locks of hair back into a wig
I had one near me at work today but couldn't track him down 
I had one neighborhood with several houses that had solar panels. I guessed biden and was wrong. I contest that result
I had only met him once, which is why I wanted Bocker's opinion on how I should feel about him
I had some sick stonks gains
I had Sunday Ticket last year, have NFL redzone through Olivia's sister's Hulu account. NFL redzone >>>>>>>>> direct tv redzone 
I had tentative dinner plans Saturday but I'm willing to renegotiate if this Monument dinner is not Fuckhole-exclusive 
I had that on my election cycle bingo card 
I had that same fear earlier 
I had the exact same thought which makes me sad
I had the same thought, Joseph, but with lots of marijuana and other recreational drugs. 
I had to become him in order to kick his ass in fantasy this week
I had to cancel the above meeting, please use the following link instead:
I had to close out and come back 
I had to do the same thing when I was looking for the job I have currently. I just was straightforward. Said I was currently applying for a new job, was wondering if I could include her as a reference, and that you'll be straightforward with your plans going forward 
I had to explain to Olivia's family what ACS was, and they are from New England
I had to fly united from Austin to Newark and didn't have outlets or free WiFi. I can't believe I had to fly in the 1960s again 
I had to go to a meeting for the addiction medicine class we're taking 
I had to kill a cockroach in the halls of Tufts Medical Center last week 
I had to make up for a difficult performance 
I had to spell it out so Joe would understand

I had to watch it like 3 times to make sure it made it 
I hadn't responded to anything since kovin posted 
I hadn't scrolled down enough. That's not a skim
I hate @Marcus Bauer 
I hate 90% of patriots fans 
I hate all goodys equally 
I hate all of you. You all make me depressed. I wake up dreading looking at my phone and seeing any notifications from you stupid assholes. I pray every night that sleep will find me quickly so I don't have to spent a single additional second conscious of the fact that any of you exist. You have prevented me from growing as a person and have done nothing but to stymie my financial and professional growth. I hate you all, and may God have mercy on your soul. 
I hate all skimmers equally. I also hate anyone who @Chanos the Mad Poster  hates because he was always my friend since after graduation.
I hate basketball season 
I hate being at work 
"I hate bill Simmons but:

I hate KP more than I hate Joe Bourque 
I hate life 
I hate Mahomes's head band 
I hate Marcus
I hate Microsoft Teams. Just use my Gmail and zoom
I hate mornings 
I hate music streaming services, but i also don't like how iTunes takes a large chunk of money from every sale. I like owning music because it contributes to the artist and the quality is generally better than torrented music. I wish artists would start selling their albums online through their own websites, like a lot of comedians are starting to do. I'd rather pay $10 right to an artist that I like than $10 to buy on the same album on iTunes 
I hate my life
I hate myself
I hate people that order food in the Dunkin drive thru during prime hours. If your order takes more than 60 seconds to get ready, you should have to go inside
I hate presidential elections because every 4 years, people act like they have been political activism fans their entire lives 
I hate Reali. Kornheiser, Wilbon, and SVP are the only respectable personalities at the SAD failing ESPN
I hate saying this, but that is what barstool has been saying since day 1. I am embarrassed to say that I agree with what barstool is saying, but I agree with what barstool is saying, even if it is all speculation 
I hate that 3rd down play
I hate that call
I hate that call. Godwin lowered his helmet to make contact.

I hate that Joe did this to us

I hate that you guys spell it doughnuts. 
I hate that. Let the kids play! 
I hate the back to back run calls. 
I hate the LLWS just like I hate everything else that other people love that I find to be overrated. 
I hate the mentality of trading your best player for a bunch of prospects 
I hate the monarchy. I'm more of a triumvirate guy
I hate the NBA. It was so much better back in my day. 
I hate the Olympics because every 4 years, people act like they have been *insert any one of dozens of sports here* fans their entire lives 
I hate the phrase "talk offline." We're talking in a face to face meeting. We are fucking offline 
I hate the ravens, but I’d like them to win this game plz

I hate this man so much. 
I hate this new GroupMe.
I hate this whole "working" thing. It makes me miss the Pats 
I hate to agree with Joe, but I agree with Joe 
I hate to be the one to say “that’s what happens when you book with Delta” but I don’t want to pile on to my good friend and the bad news he’s received regarding his well-deserved vacation. 
I hate to break it to you but becker is mexican. Or vaguely middle eastern. 
I hate to disagree with my friend @Skimmer , but Bocker did call white people weird too
I hate to disagree, but nothing @Joey Brackets says or does should be considered good 
I hate to say she's wrong, but she's wrong 
I hate using public restrooms that don't have automatic toilets/sinks. My office has spoiled me 
I HATE watching players on my team play. It makes me a horrible fan 
I hate when Joe has hope
I hate when people use the word "brawl" when it clearly was just 99% pushing and shoving and 1% the Reds manager getting rolled over
I hate when there isn't a Manningcast
I hate you darrow. 
I hate you Joe. 
I hate you so much that I ran a mile twice because the video cut off the first time
I have

I have a cookie cutter answer but could always use some local expertise 
I have a cyst on my right ball so I’m a certified big baller 
I have a cyst on my right ball that I thought was cancer. The Fuckholes' balls are all sorts of fucked up 
I have a disability recognized by the ADA. I am the most disabled. The disabled love me. 
I have a friend from high school who is an engineer. She works for a firm that inspects buildings after the collapse to determine who is at fault and also acts as a third party inspector for buildings currently being built. Pretty sure her starting salary was close to six figures and she gets flown all over the country to consult. She just spent the last month in a house in California that her company rented for her, complete with a pool with a swim up bar and hot tub 
I have a gluten free pizza mix at home. I'm making motherfucking white pizza for the super bowl. And labeling it gluten free so no one touches it 
I have a google doc shared out with the Boda Borg people. They've been updating it as people have completed waivers. It's says you completed yours haha. Must be a different Andrew Becker. 
I have a great new idea. Instead of taking the SATs, the loser of our league has to remake the Blank Space music video 
I have a huge box of like 4,000 baseball cards too. I wonder what I could sell those for. Probably like $60 knowing my luck 
I have a kadabra
I have a LinkedIn but I don't use it 
I have a lot of issues 
I have a lot of respect for the one single teammate that didn't walk completely to the other side of the court. Whoever it was, he stayed with Nurkic while he was being tended to on the court, like a good teammate should
I have a lot to hide in this text thread

I have a shit ton of Legos. Too bad I just dumped all of the pieces in a huge box instead of keeping each set separate. 
I have a team now! 
I have a two game lead on both John and Jamie for the posa. If they lose this week, I still keep the two game lead with only one game remaining in the regular season 
I have a WFH story to rival Ross. I'm helping with a research project for Cambridge Health Alliance. I basically am pulling data on about 40 patients enrolled in a study, which should take me two days to complete. Before Covid, this would have meant going into their Malden office, but the office won't let any non-essential employees in so I have to do it from home. No biggy, just have to get remote access. The project manager requests access for me on Tuesday. I got an email almost immediately saying I was good to go. Three days and a half dozen phone calls later, my access still doesn't work so they had to delete my account and start over again. I finally get logged in this morning, but it turns out no one activated my Epic access, so I can't open patient charts. IT decides that I never completed the right training and so they assign me some random online course to do before I get access. I finish that about an hour ago and finally get approved to open up Epic. As soon as I do that...

I have abandoned Mr. Steal Yo Gurl 
I have access to HBO through Olivia's sister's Hulu account, but I do have a few shows on there that I watch. Did I mention that I am watching The Wire? 
I have actually come around on my perspective. Previously, I was for expansion, but I do agree with Morcus. More teams that are worse will not help make these games competitive.
I have actually not been reading the Bible. I was just joking with you 
I have already paid for cocktail class tonight. What time are you doing this meetup 
I have also gotten free food for switching but in that instance, the flight attendant actually asked me to switch to allow a little kid to sit with his mom 
I have also planned on munching on some Mexican meats tomorrow evening for quite some time and the thought of that makes me happy 
I have always been

I have always been a Ners fan 
I have always been the biggest supporter of Kirk in the GroupMe, besides @Beanboy of course 
I have always been your friend. I can still tell you to go fuck yourself
I have always had respect for McCain. I'm happy that he voted for what he thought was right, in terms of process and content
I have always vocally opposed any mention of a team or player with no context of what happened
I have an alcohol addiction. You weren't there for me. 
I have an announcement 
I have an announcement 
I have an autographed amare suns jersey

I have an evacuation everyday around 10 am
I have an exam on that Monday 
I have an exam to study for will probably be around at night 
I have an idea. The unrest in the middle East is probably due to lack of work. Why don't we just invade those countries and build big camps where we can put citizens to work? We can cut costs by restricting calorie intake and building a ton of bunk beds. There's nothing historically wrong with that plan 
I have an idea. Why don't we just replace IT in the trade with Marcus smart 
I have an idea. Why don't you find the website for this league, go to it, and see what they charge per team per season?

I have been in lab all day and haven’t been watching. Can I get an update please

I have been JC's fan since day one
I have been losing my mind recently with referring hospitals not doing shit to take care of patients and dumping all their patients on my hospital and no one wants to do shit about it 
I have been reformed. I am no longer happy about him always being injured. I would rather him be healthy so the Pats OL can continue to stuff him in a locker every time the Pats play the Texans
I have been seeing a bunch of billboards for "Dr. Shiva" from the GOP side of the MA senate election. I just googled him and he is an MIT PhD who is absolutely batshit crazy
I have been telling you guys for like a decade that the T is fucking awful. 
I have been there many times. 
I have been with someone who has bought a used car
I have booked my dinner choices for my trip to Philadelphia this week 
I have cake
I have called GI in overnight for fishbones and they have come in to scope 
I have called the same customer service number twice. The first time, I got an automated message that asked me my purpose for calling; when the answer wasn't "book a new flight," they disconnected me. I called the number back and went straight to a "roadside assistance promotion number." When I said I was not interested in the deal, they disconnected me
I have catan and the expansion pack but since Joe asked, I will not bring them
I have chart review to do if you want to come over and help 
I have chips and popcorn and a little extra buff chick dip. So anything else besides that. Any time works for me
I have chosen to deputize @AbadBot as my right-hand typo catcher 
I have chromecast. My mom has Apple TV. No subscription 
I have class at Harvard until 9:30, I'll have my car, so maybe I can swing by after. Or find some time between 5 and 6:45 to drop it off 
I have class for a few more weeks. Unsure how often I would be able to be there but am not opposed 
I have class until noon and then working on my public health capstone project 
I have CNN open so I'll let you know when I start seeing them update stuff

I have completed my Maine Medical Center interview

I have confirmed that one bar in fact did close. And Chan's jersey curse is very real 
I have decided to skim all basket all talk from now until the end of the GroupMe 
I have decided to tank too. Clearly not a result of my poor team building skills. Clearly planned tanking
I have different avatars across groupme groups
I have discussed with bocker how my words were hurtful and I have apologized privately. We will now move on from that conversation. Thank you for trying to contribute, Anthony.

I have gone through the stages of grief and now root for Brady but root for Arians to retire before the super bowl 
I have had a bunch of sennheiser pairs that were >$100, all sounded great but my $150 pair doesn't sound any different than my $100 pair did. I now have the bose quietcomfort 35s. Don't sound any different than the other pairs, but have Bluetooth and noise canceling for $200 more. If I didn't have a ton of gift cards, I would have never bought them 
I have had a really bad string of constipation patients. I scooped poop out of an old demented lady last week. This weekend, I had multiple peds patients that needed enemas or cleanouts. And last night I got signed out two really bad constipation patients that needed manual disimpactions and multiple enemas 
"I have had several bad roommates:
1) Treven, freshman year, who would wake me up at 3 am by microwaving queso (the microwave was under my bed) and typing essays with all of the lights on, and for getting into prank wars with our neighbors who would then wake me up in the middle of the night too. And he would also watch braveheart on my TV when the Patriots were on and wouldn't change the channel when I asked, despite having watched braveheart like 6 times freshman year "
I have had to actually report for jury duty twice. I have also been cancelled in advance once, and was summoned to a different county and was thus excused once. It's not lit fam.
I have halfway through typing but Bock Boi has a good explanation 
I have heady topper 
I have heard good things about Highland Kitchen in Somerville but have not tried it myself
I have heard great things about the show with Jason Segal and Harrison Ford but haven’t watched it
I have heard of it too

I have hundreds saved on my phone
I have indeed read it. All I have to say is....damn.

I have it on in the background 
I have James white on the field for that 100 times out of 100
I have kind of an ignorant question. I haven’t read any of the articles, but what about paying kids to go to school elicits a huge lawsuit? I understand the breach of NCAA and how that should be addressed at the NCAA level, but where exactly did they break the law 
I have known you for longer than 6 years goody 
I have learned a lot. Like no one appreciated my reference to the Egyptians enslaving the Jews to build pyramids.
I have leftovers from dinner on Friday that day in the car for four hours after we finished dinner, so probably not a good idea to eat them but they were so good that it hurts to toss them 
I have literally never pretended to be a Ks fan
I have literally zero interest in seeing the cowboys play any extra games this season, or any season 
I have lived through the embarrassment once. I will never go through that again 
I have loans if you want to make this a joint marriage thing? 
I have looked at neither of those things 
I have lots of experience in streaming

I have met her once and I can tell you that what you’re describing is his personality 
I have Monday off 
I have more points scored than Darrow, Marcus, John, and Jamie, who are all ahead of me in your little ranking
I have more respect for Jamie than any non-Patriots fan in here plus Joe
I have more respect for Murkowski and Collins, who were berated by their own party members, president, and secretary of the interior for sticking up for what they thought was right for their constituents
I have my checkbook open 
I have my interview in 18 minutes. Should I lead with my explanation why humans need act to prevent annihilation by our lobster overlords? Or save that for my closing remarks? 
I have never actually met Coleman but he looks like an absolute tool on his facebook
I have never and will never feel that way 
I have never been as Team Emyr as I am right now. I love him so much

I have never been to The Matterhorn but Darrow has and it's a popular post ski food spot 
I have never been wrong 
I have never been wrong about a preseason stud

I have never seen a defensive 3 second violation called
I have never seen Joe Bourque lose a round of golf to Bocker
I have never skimmed a day in my life 
I have never used a bidet but I am very pro bidet. Seems more sanitary, better for the environment, less risky if you're like goody and never know when you;re gunna get a good bunghole licking
I have new found confidence in myself after this trade and will now be aiming for 6th place again 
I have no basis for this claim, but kuechly is 100% to blame for Peyton Manning getting another ring. I could never vote for him. 
I have no clue but I'm just going to guess that it's a group of males from chorale 
I have no clue how goody has survived this pandemic 
I have no clue what I did 
I have no clue what the fuck is going on 
I have no clue where that number came from 
I have no clue who the dudes before him were. 
I have no clue who this guy is but based on the fact that he played 16 games for the Jets last year and totaled 10 tackles, I am sure he'll be a stud
I have no clue why that image says "funny money" but obviously I did not read it closely for quote accuracy
I have no clue. I saw she was hot and posted it.
I have no concept of when I songs came out. Thus I am no help 
I have no desire to answer your poorly constructed trivia question 
I have no desire to have another social media account. 
I have no doubt I would curl up in a ball and Sonic the hedgehog my way out of any encounter 
I have no doubt that BB will trade Special Teams Assistant Joe Houston to the Jets to be their next head coach, in exchange for the 1st overall pick. 
I have no doubt that Eastern Mississippi CC would blow out BC
I have no doubt that Goody planned this. 
I have no doubt that the 205 I'm probably going to get on step 1 will be enough for me to match into plastics at harvard 
I have no doubt that you will get no where near that much influence in our country. 
I have no faith that a team that got three wins (2 of them being against FCS teams and one against a non-P5 opponent) last year will get 9 wins next year 
I have no idea what 6 7 is other than it’s probably dumb skibidy toilet type shit
I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself for another 5 hours. I'm already tired of jerking to patriots highlights and pump up videos. 
I have no idea what that means but as far as I understand it, there are a finite number of bitcoins that was determined when bitcoin was launched. 
I have no idea who Marcus and Becker are
I have no income and no home ownership. What taxes do I pay?

I have no intention of going there if Joe is there. 
I have no interest in bitstrips 
I have no negative feelings for BoB or the Texans in general. I hate Watt
I have no opinion on the matter. Just mourning the loss of John
I have no other examples 
I have no personal experience with either but I would rather go to Barcelona. 
I have no problem with him playing as long as he is a free man. But teams are only going to absorb the bad pr for signing him if he is worth it with how he performs on the field. He showed he obviously has the ability to get to the quarterback, so he will find a home. 
I have no problem with pagano specifically and hope his story reaches an audience that draws inspiration from it. I just wish ESPN spent as much time fact checking important stories as they do beating the dead horse that is "feel good" stories 
I have no proof that you didn't cheat 
I have no proof that your groupme conversation isn't made up

I have no unofficial statement for public record 
I have not 
I have not

I have not been there in 15+ years and would never go back 
I have not been watching but can only assume that Drake Maye is going to lead us to the super bowl this year 
I have not had trillium beer 
I have not heard of another plan
I have not heard that term before 
I have not listened to Gregg’s podcast but I enjoy heed the call. I don’t hate 60% G but I prefer him the least of the three still alive 
I have not looked into grants but when submitting the fafsa for medical school, they still take into account your parent's income even if they don't provide financial support. 
I have not lost weight and until recently, have not been watching what I was eating. I hit my highest weight ever.

I have not. Just realizing now....
I have not. Would you recommend?
I have nothing but respect for Flores. And Tua is the best QB in Florida
I have nothing to live for
I have now been revaccinated.
I have now decided that I don't care about any help. I'm just going to spend the last 1.5 hours launching angry birds 
I have now finished my first rotation back in the hospital.
I have now finished my last practice exam before step 1. Bocker has been my motivational coach through this whole process. I'd like to take a minute to thank him for his dedication to the fuckholes' collective and individual success 
I have now finished season 1 of The Wire. It is good
I have one at home, but I appreciate the offer 
I have one pair, which I happen to be wearing now, where the hole is somehow permanently open. Like the flap that's supposed to cover the hole doesn't so my junk is kind of completely out there. It's liberating 
I have one. If only you planned this on a weekend where I could go 
I have only ever head of Moldova from that list 
I have only ordered 1 scan in 4 hours for my patients 
I have only played OoT and MM. Thought OoT was definitely better because of how groundbreaking it was at the time for video games. I really enjoyed the mask side quests in MM but didn't really like the time constraints. 
"I have only read half of the article before I was forced to do real work today:

1) Goodell looks like an idiot. It seems like he tried to coverup the spy gate investigation. And then the owners didn't think that the punishment was severe enough, so they wanted deflategate to be more
2) I want to know where they are getting these ridiculous claims that pats staff was stealing play books from other teams
3) why the fuck is spygate being brought up again? If otl wanted to investigate anything, they should investigate deflategate, because it's relevant "
I have ordered so many scans tonight 
I have osmosed enough of the mandalorian from when Olivia watched it to form a completely uninformed opinion that it isn't that great
I have plans tomorrow. 
I have plenty of cider and will be serving up two specialty margaritas 
I have plenty of ciders that I am happy to share as well 
I have plenty of downeast and catan

I have PTSD from the last time they cancelled the super bowl 
I have purchased Sunday Ticket U and am enjoying it, except that it advertised "NFL Redzone" but it is actually DirectTV's Redzone channel. I miss Scott.
I have put many a finger up a butt 
I have read several articles, including the NYT article from Jordan, and reviewed some of the preliminary data from the studies we have conducted thus far and have decided that my argument was incorrect. 
I have reemerged from my 7 hours of zoom interviews 
I have rented uhaul trucks twice and never had an issue. Can be expensive though 
I have risen from the ashes like a phoenix 
I have said this a billion times but wild walking into Fenway and watching that TD drive from the TVs at Game On. Then having some losers on the Budweiser roof deck give up their table in the 6th inning so we could get a fantastic view of Ortiz hitting the grand slam against the tigers in the playoffs
I have scarnecchia's body type too (minus 50 years), so maybe I'm a genius o line coach and just haven't realized?
I have seen a lot of reactions to the Trump tweets, but no one I’ve seen mentioned that this wasn’t his first time running for President... 
I have seen this play out before....
I have sent out four cover letters/CVs and have received zero responses. They be hating on your boi 
I have settled my debt with James Bourque.
I have some room in my attic for some oil
I have soured on Romo
I have taken down the evil commissioner and mildly fucked over Darrow in the process. This is truly a win for all fuckholes 
I have talked to James a total of twice in my life, if that. That said, I know nothing about him that would negatively influence my opinion on him joining the league 
I have Texans d
I have that effect on people 
I have that problem too. I make meals for the week and but normally don't have food prepared for the weekend so I end up ordering out or buying something that I can make quickly, which is not always healthy 
I have that problem too. My third leg is longer than my other two. 
I have the #2 pick in Olivia's family's FF draft in 6 minutes. I have to go CMC right?
I have the benefit of Olivia working nights still, so I watch all my shows at night or when she is asleep during the day
I have the best bench
i have the best running back situation in the league. it's just not sustainable
I have the best team. My team is great. The only reason I lost is because this league is RIGGED.
I have the complete opposite opinion as Becker. I don't know if it's because I don't support trump or what, but trump sounds like an idiot 
I have the draft set on my calendar for 7 on Saturday 
I have the game up on my phone because dumb topgolf doesn't have the right channel 
I have the laptop. Olivia has the pro
I have the most empathy. My empathy is bigger than anyone's. My empathy is the best empathy. 
I have the QC35s. Pretty good, no real complaints. They go on sale around the holidays and Amazon Prime Day usually.
I have the talking stick 
I have them very often
I have this one Asian friend who takes Snapchats (I know, who still uses Snapchat?) of Asians walking around the city in which he lives to make fun of them for being tourists.

I have to do what I can. No one else pays attention to me

I have to make a class during our "spring break" now, and I have an exam on marathon Monday 
I have to read about treating hemochromatosis and alcoholic hepatitis in the setting of acute on chronic liver injury
I have to run to Boston after work and then run home. If I have enough time to get to your place before the draft starts, I will definitely be over but not sure what traffic will look like 
I have to say 
I have to say that I would have absolutely been incredibly confused if I started with a select few of the episodes
I have to say, I didn't think that the Dan Campbell experiment was going to go well. Happy to be wrong
I have to say, the only redeeming thing about the London games is that there is football when I wake up in the morning 
I have to side with @#Just📠✅. He's my ride or die 
I have to take another statistics course. I have no clue what I am doing 
I have to work for the next 8 hours so please save all GroupMe litness until I am done. Thank you 
I have traditionally done the standard method (as bocker has described). I have tried reverse sear once and ended up overcooking it so I was disappoint. I will definitely try again though
I have tried so many times to adequately recreate my Chipotle meal at home and thus far have not succeeded. If anyone has a recipe recommendation that actually works, let me know.
I have two decent qbs. I have a good rb to use. And a good defense.
I have two right near my apartment but I can't access them without leaving my apartment, and one right across the street at work but just slightly too far. I've been out of pokeballs for three days now. 
I have unfortunately returned to Boston 
I have University of Washington next month, and Utah is mountain west, but I am interviewing there in 2 weeks. I declined an interview from Oregon.
I have used both but typically use cancelled 
I have used the pre made covers too in some bathrooms that wouldn't meet criteria for a toilet paper next 
I have very few podcasts that don't cut away to ads in the middle 
I have very much enjoyed it, thank you for asking 
I have vitally important news to share with the group 
I have went back through every instance of "credit card," "JetBlue," and "Jet Blue" in GroupMe history and cannot find any proof that I skimmed Bock Boi getting his own credit card.
I have work, then class til 730 tonight, so I will be unable to attend. 
I have worked multiple 90+ hour weeks in medical school
I have worn jeans to go to the grocery store. But I've lived in sweatpants and pajamas as well
I have yet to have someone die on me unexpectedly. I did have two patients in the MICU who died overnight while I was off shift
I have yet to see one 
I have zero clue about suturing, because we haven’t done it yet, but I would say that that’s a big enough gash to probably warrant getting it looked at 
I have zero clue what happened 
I have zero interest in you
I have, once again, beaten Covid (vaccine). You don't need to call me a hero, but I won't argue if you do

I haven’t gotten any pictures of him going down that trail, or of him lying dead on the side of the mountain 
I haven’t heard anything from the commissioner 
I haven’t listened to any of the Tuesday shows except for the one with the first contest. I also got the Shannon Sharpe one wrong. I have no clue about the other questions 
I haven't been following 
I haven't been following the nba at all (other than knowing that the warriors are good) but why is it being so hyped up?
I haven't been to too many national parks. I don't want to rank the ones that I have been too because I'm afraid my list would be subject to recency bias 
I haven't bought Downeast in ages. 1) because it tastes too sweet to me so I can only have one or two at a time; 2) because anytime I want one, I just have to look in my fridge and grab one of the ones Joe left at my house last time he was here
I haven't eaten either in >10 years so I reserve the right to blame bad memory on my opinions
I haven't even deplaned but LGA has no amenities 
I haven't had chipotle in a year. @#JustFacts✅ will understand how impressive that is

I haven't invited anyone else but if you have friends you want to bring, that's fine with me 
I haven't kept up with the leaks. Did she just shit on Bernie sanders a ton?

I haven't listened in ~4 months, so no promises its still good

I haven't seen it. It's only on in the background
I haven't seen them do anything that makes them look like a good football team 
I haven't torrented anything since high school. This is all bringing back memories 
I haven't watched any ESPN programming that wasn't a Monday night or college football game since probably September. I only liked one or two of the ATH guys. I used to love PTI but it started to get old 
I haven't watched any of it

I hired someone to scare the shit out of Joe for moving in with Matt Moran. I hold grudges 
I hit snooze twice on my alarm today. Also atypical 
I hit that first bulbasaur almost every time. Probably 13 out of 16 throws. 12 great balls, 4 ultra balls before I caught him 
I hold grudges well
I honestly can't believe you just said Sandler was better than Bill Murray
I honestly can't do either of those things 
I honestly can't think of another Patriots QB before Cam 
I honestly couldn't even take a guess where the "red line in the sand" is for action. There is just so much we don't know about the virus, anything is a guess at this point
I honestly couldnt tell you 
I honestly did not understand it 
I honestly didn’t think Foles could come up with enough magic to win, but I could see Philly’s D winning the game for them. This one hurts, for me, because Brady had a fucking amazing game but Foles had enough magic to win 
I honestly didn't know that the Celtics had a team before this year 
I honestly don't know 
I honestly don't know how that works but I figure there should be a way for the justice department to reprimand a state for enacting discriminatory law 
I honestly don't remember

I honestly feel bad for you Jaime. To be in Europe and have to come back to the shithole that is wakefield mass 
I honestly have no idea what just happened
I honestly have only been challenged twice. Once by Joseph about 20 minutes ago

I honestly still don't know the defensive points allowed brackets 
I honestly think that Peyton plays another season, but I believe that Broncos can terminate his contract this year if he doesn't pass a physical in the offseason. If he doesn't play for the Broncos, he won't retire, he will go to another team 
I honestly thought I cut off all contact with him when I left the other GroupMe since that's the only one he posts in 
I honestly wouldn't be surprised. 9 years is a long time

I hope this political argument is done by the time my classes are over so I can complain about being in the library on a Friday night 
I hope this question is a ruse by Jordan to make the GroupMe lit again

I hope you all get the plague 
I hope you can sleep at night 
I hope you can sleep at night. 
I hope you can use them for years if they last forever 
I hope you didn't pick me, because after that text message to Joe, I would testify that you were delusional
I hope you die a slow and painful death alone and empty 
I hope you get into an accident on the Tobin and plunge off the bridge into the icy waters below, and remain unconscious until its too late for you to escape your car, then regain consciousness just in time for you to realize the irony of your impending death as you asphyxiate in your sinking car while staring up at the bridge you once mocked at the expensive of your friend Joff 
I hope you get one of the three strains of the flu floating around Fenway

I hope your work burns all of your food from now on 
I hope you're not. I would hate for Becker to be right about anything 
I identify as a white boy in America
I identify with being American 
I ignored your basketball message because I would rather castrate myself with a rusty spork than discuss and/or watch a non-playoff basketball game at any competitive level 
I imagine that the Fuck Joff/Cum Boi GroupMe is lit as fuck.
I imagined an overweight, middle aged secretary type female. I didn't really get the impression of a corporate executive 
I immediately hate these girls. I was enjoying that they were causing you pain, but now I don't like them 
I impressed the ortho residents by calling a subcapital femur fracture that radiology missed. Wasn't even my patient. @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD do your fucking job
I in fact do not enjoy that 
I in fact do not hate my friends nor do I hate fitness. I, however, have signed up to play soccer again today 
I in fact do not know 
I informed him of his mistake and he corrected the issue
I inserted it up Joe's rectum. Good luck. 
I intend for no one to understand the reference 
I interviewed at the other 7 of my programs that I had yet to interview at 
I invested in my clippers at the start of the quarantine. 
I invite Bocker and Joe to my place. He responds by inviting everyone to Kristen's. 
I invoke Goody's logic to argue my point (that always works, right?)
I invoke my 5th amendment rights
I jack off to as much porn as I want, thank you very much 
I jumped into Darrow's arms after the Butler pick 
I just am not convinced that Goff is anything better than an average QB. If you don't think you can get better than average on the open market or draft a guy who can start right away, then obviously resign him 
I just ask Google to put the recipe on my Google Hub
I just assumed even if Ryan dropped tannehill, he would go to waivers to be processed tonight 
I just assumed he's playing golf because he got fired. 
I just assumed jkell was jordan Kelleher

I just assumed you inherited it? It's genetic right?
I just bet my house on Nasty Nate 
I just bitched to you guys enough to make you remember it 9 years later instead
I just booked a hotel for a trip to Portland instead of AirBnB because any of the quality units ended up being 25% more after fees and taxes 
I just bought a Groupon for one month at Rock Spot. I’m hoping trying something more interesting that’s close to home will help me with motivation 
I just bought yak trax and starts running outside this week. They actually work really well 
I just called a 3rd time and got a "you dialed a number not available from your calling area" error and immediately got disconnected
I just came
I just came twelve times in the last 5 minutes
I just can’t stand them demeaning women like that by calling the hoez any longer 
I just confirmed
I just confirmed that Darrow is the only one in MyWoodIsPlywood who has not participated in Clan Games
I just did them myself for the first time in <1 hour, got more in refunds than I got last (probably tied to making more money) and my federal return was accepted an hour after I submit them 
I just don't get how any measure other than points allowed can be used to judge a defense. You judge an offense by the number of points it scores, not how many yards it accumulates 
I just don't get what the independent spotter does if they don't stop the game after a dude takes a murder shot to the head
I just don't get why they didn't hire a PJ to get to Mount Vesuvius or wherever they dropped the ring
I just don't know how you don't pick from any of the positions you lost in free agency 
I just don't know how, in this day of age, we didn't know that this attack happened 
I just don't trust anyone who thinks that wins against Rutgers and Texas State in back to back seasons isn't predictive of the program's meteoric rise 
I just edited the sheet 
I just ended up with a doctor that didn't suck
I just feel like it would have been nice to let his Astoria roommate know he was moving 
I just feel like it’s my duty to point out that the term pink hat doesn’t always mean that the individual is wearing a pink hat at that moment in time. 
I just feel that like at this point, what's done is done and there's no point in talking about it until 2017
I just figured it out. It's because of the extra point 
I just finished my interview for the Medical Education Chief position
I just finished my last residency interview 
I just finished season 1 of Rome on HBO. What a depressing ending to the season 
I just finished that book, Chan
I just finished the episode 15 seconds ago
I just finished watching trapped in the closet
I just found an alpaca ranch in Harvard, MA
I just found out that Harvard, mit, and tufts weren't the same school. Confusing because they're all on the red line 
I just gave out candy to a kid dressed as Cole Beasley 
I just googled best patriots players of all time and think I have guesses for the last two but don't want to ruin it for everyone else still guessing 
I just googled it and the first pages are variations of "why is it so hard to build aircraft carriers" but that doesn't fit my #Narrative
I just got a chill from how cold that take was 
I just got an email confirmation for an order from Urban outfitters. The order was being shipped to a Jeffrey savarino in South Dakota but the billing address was some dude in Seattle using a credit card that was not mine 
I just got back to my office. They were passing the common 
I just got home from the grocery store and am making a really late dinner so for those reasons, I'm out 
I just got introduced to the character Claire on The Bear and I have decided that she's the coolest character in the show. Hope she keeps coming back 
I just got it right, so...
I just got on the bus to bring me to Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina 
I just got out of a meeting and got all the messages from you fuckholes. Just to clarify, clowney sucks 
I just got out of work and don't know how this really happened, but I assume, based on my luck, that I will have the win stripped from me by the time I wake up tomorrow 
I just got the text 
I just got the update. That's the best I got 
I just got their email and realized that I too and still subscribed and did not plan on unsubscribing despite now moving further away 
I just had a baby. I have literally nothing but free time
I just had a great idea. What if we reduce the points per touchdown from 6 to 4. Touchdowns are way overvalued anyway 
I just had a hulu ad for Trump strictly about him bringing back the Big 10
I just hate Scott and that I suck at trivia
"I just hate:
a) inpatient medicine
b) prerounds
c) rounds
d) everything about inpatient medicine "
I just have a strong cultural identity you racist assnut
I just hear what my physician leaders bitch about 
I just heard about this: so the boston police chief who replaced Bill Evans retired the other day. So one of the higher ups got sworn in as acting commissioner on Monday. Well, two days later, Walsh has to put him on leave because the globe reports that the guy threatened to shoot his wife (also a cop) in 1999. In his defense, it doesn't look like he was ever charged and he denies that it happened. But if it is true, how do you let that guy even work as a cop after that?
I just hole peed and it was the best part of my day 
I just hope for goody's sake they /r/midgettransvestitebeastiality doesn't turn to private in protest. 
I just hope for the day when the masses can see darrow's crooked emails. SAD
I just hope he doesn't get suspended until after bocker pays to keep him 
I just hope he had time to read that @joffbot was added to the GroupMe and that he needs to do his part now 
I just hope I am not blowing up someone's #Narrative
I just hope that @Beanboy remails @Super Bowl LIX Planning Committee President his gift 
I just hope that the whole process still has integrity 
I just hope that this isn't the stance that the NFL takes. Not because I don't want to see Peyton play again, because I love the Brady-Peyton rivalry. But it's a serious claim and it should be looked at 
I just hope the girls going to prom during my wedding were safe
I just hope this info didn't fall into the wrong hands
I just keep finding worse and worse things about him
I just landed and I immediately feel the need to eat opossum stew and marry my cousin 
I just learned from Twitter that this happened because he got the COVID vaccine
I just learned that the Cardinals roll the turf out before every game 
I just learned that the woman in the blue jacket who was crip walking during Kendrick's performance was Serena Williams. I did not realize it live
I just learned where Syria was last week (👉🏻^_^)👉🏻
I just like Carrie Underwood. 
I just like to have a role 
I just like to jerk with my Fuckholes during the games. 
I just logged in and it looks like Kovin is on with his friend Ayal
I just logged in to try and find it. Took 37 seconds
I just looked at his Instagram for 30 seconds and decided that there is no way he took any of those picture or are any of that food. I don’t know how Instagram works, but he definitely was sent most of those pictures and just asked to post them for restaurant publicity 
I just looked at my fantasy app for the first time in a bit and saw that he was up to 6 touchdowns
I just looked it up because I was curious. 45% of adults >=18 in 2018/2019
I just looked it up for you broseph, doesn't look like parking should be affected in Brookline
I just looked up their menu, Rudy's doesn't seem to have goji berries 
I just looked, telling me no fee
I just made eye contact with David Andrews 
I just make misinformed jokes about religion
I just meant that I didn't get the context since the screen hadn't happened yet according to my TV 
I just moved my Step 2 date up to Monday and will now be taking it at Brown. I will still not be leaving my house this weekend
I just must not hang out with you as much 
I just need all of my money to make me more money immediately. Why is that so hard?
I just need to pray for a field goal and overtime
I just noticed that Kirk Cousins truther @Jamie Bourque hasn't been seen in here since his boi shat himself again yesterday 
I just opened the check. They underpaid me by $1526. Fucking bitches 
I just ordered chicken and waffles for the first time ever. Is this what it's like to feel alive? 
I just orgasmed all over myself and I wasn’t even jacking off 
I just polled my friends. 6 say Seattle, two say south East Asia
I just posted it in the groupme, therefore it just happened 
I just ran into a JAMA article about "how to create a COVID vaccination plan" from May 2020. Guess no one read it
I just read a blog on that new rookie from Africa named Ebola. I heard he is really going to kill it. I am confused if he is on Dallas or New York though. I have heard conflicting reports 
I just read into it more. Last week, people were saying they were associated but the group claims not to be the same people as the organizers of Charlottesville. I stand correct. I mean, fuck you, I'm not wrong 
I just read that Crabtree is getting an extension for about $8 mil a year. I thought that was absurdly high for someone his aging, thinking he was like 34. Look him up and find out he's only fucking 28
I just read that Drew Brees wears #9 to honor Ted Williams. I am liking this guy more and more 
I just read the Leahy letter. I see zero things wrong with his statement
I just realized that @Chanley Yelnats  mentioned a free parking space earlier and @Skimmer  didn't even blink
I just realized that BB is waiting to retire until he can field a team exclusively of players with Jones as the last name 
I just realized that if I win one of the next two games, I am eliminated from posa contention 
I just realized what makes Dennis Clifford's "going out to eat" comment even sadder. THEY FUCKING GOT NOROVIRUS WHEN THEY WENT TO EAT AT CHIPOTLE 
I just remembered that I'm paying for Apple+
I just saw on Reddit that Bourne trips over his own feet during the play. That safety who came over to make the pick was only free because he no longer had to cover Bourne. As soon as he falls, he rotates over to where the ball is thrown 
I just saw that the pelicans won their play in game. Zion must have played really well
I just saw the td 
I just saw the umass td, how delayed is my stream?
I just saw this, so my day just got much worse
I just say it fast enough that no one can tell which I say
I just spit out coffee and I was even drinking any. 
I just suck
I just suck 
I just took all of the New England programs off of my rank list 
I just turned on the tv and realized that I don't get HD channels anymore. Should I kill myself now or wait until football season? 
I just turned the game on but I can already tell what they're doing wrong. I haven't seen any Grant Williams 3 point attempts 
I just turned the game on in time to see the muffed punt 
I just walked into loco to eat brunch for myself (open house today, so kicked out for two hours). Of course golf is on TV. Bocker is haunting me 
I just walked into the student lounge and someone is having the exact same conversation 
I just want all that HATERS and LOSERS (@HoopKid92 OBGYN) to know that I have lost 8.8 lbs thanks to the Fuckswoles 
I just want everyone to know how brave I am as I fight off these terrible Covid (vaccine) symptoms

I just want everyone to know that I paid @2017 Champ 
I just want everyone to know that if we don't get along and work together, we will never solve the mystery of the the Thirst Trap Shooter 
I just want to commend the Foxtrots for engaging in the perfect amount of Celtics talk last night 
I just want to go back to the days of fried chicken and video games
I just want to make sure you always know when you're wrong 
I just want to mention that Massachusetts has a very robust contact tracing program and has an abundance of testing sites. We as a state are theoretically doing a good job of testing and following up to make sure people are quarantining. Plus the rates of infections were already declining in Massachusetts before the protests, whereas I believe that they were increasing in California. It's very possible, if not almost certain, that two different outdoor events could result in different changes to the rate of infection. There may be fewer infectious people at the protests in MA because of the systems we have in place versus other areas of the country. That last point is highly speculative and I have no data to back that up
I just want to point out that I was at your mod for this tailgate but had left to go get something to eat at the dining hall when you took this picture. Therefore you chose to include Yolanda in this picture but not me 
I just want to point out that Joe dropped Brock Osweiler and then Kovin picked him up this morning. I think we have some more collusion going on...
I just want to say that I finally got around to reading all of Joe's comments and very much appreciate his insight. I legitimately laughed out loud at the last sentence, which is kind of horrifying.
I just want welker to retire so I can feel comfortable wearing my welker jersey again 
I just want you guys to care about beating me as much as you care about beating your coworkers 
I just want you to know that you're loved  
I just wanted him to come participate in the conversation.
I just wanted to compliment you and say how nice it looked
I just wanted to hang out with you bby
I just wanted to share my life story with you
I just was the one to realize you were hanging out of your boxers...
I just watched that today
I just watched the 30 for 30 on the bc point shaving scandal. Do you guys want to start point shaving? I feel like we could get away with it 
I just watched the last five minutes. Seemed miserable. Don't know how you watched the whole thing 
I just went for a walk around the block and saw a rhyhorn and snorlax pop up but they were too far away from my office to justify chasing them during work hours 
I just went out into the hallway when I needed to 
I just wish @👀 was here
I just wrote 40% of your draft recap for you 
I keep my side of the street clean
I keep the 🐳 list. 
I keep trying to do it on giphy but I keep getting an error. They just don't tell me what the error means
I keep waiting for something really interesting to happen and keep being disappointed 
I keep you employed 
I kept trying to find the course next to Newton comm but then realized that I had the direction swapped 
I killed the Fuckholes
I kind of assumed he already was 
I kind of do but I log in like twice a week on my iPad. 
I kind of like it better this way 
I kind of miss them, in a weird way. Seeing Bocker rant about something that doesn’t involve me makes my day brighter 
I kinda feels like @Beanboy  went to B school
I kinda just listen to the audio. I don't think not seeing the video greatly detracts from the experience
I knew 
I knew as of yesterday afternoon that Shawn king's tweet was wrong. I was hoping not to be called out for it 
I knew Chan was always my friend 
I knew he sounded familiar. I remember when the MB one went viral
I knew he was a great guy the moment I held the Ed-mods elevator for him and he said thank you 
I knew he was a lying piece of shit 
I knew he was smart 
I knew he'd come back. He's not Jordan 
I knew I always loved the troops 
I knew I could never count on you 
I knew it was homestar but that's as far as I got 
I knew it, because of the champagne
I knew it. Our commissioner is afraid to take action. Bocker for Commish
I knew Mahomes was overrated
I knew my man was taking care of his woman. No doubt. 
I knew of him, obviously 
I knew that bocker was a piece of shit for joining that union 
I knew that bracket was ours!
I knew that he would have my back 
I knew that I'd eventually win 
I KNEW that McVay knew what he was doing when he settled for a field goal
I knew that story looked familiar
I knew that was going to happen 
I knew that you were always my friend. My "friend" wants a penile organ of African American appearance
I knew that you were too out of shape to survive the Rona
I knew there was a reason why @Skimmer was always my friend 
I knew there was a reason why last night felt so peaceful 
I knew this league couldn't survive without @The Big Dick Bandit. I've been saying it since day one 
I knew we needed to post more pictures of attractive women. John wouldn't have gotten hurt if he had more tits to look at 
I knew we shouldn't have rigged the championship to let him win 
I knew what it was because we discussed the man getting killed with a football at Chan’s apartment 
I knew what the gif was before it even loaded. What a great moment for pats fans, and therefore, the world. 
I knew when the reservation was but repeated Goody’s question to be annoying 
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT
I knew you wouldn't stand me up
I knew you’d come around. Happy to have you buddy 
I know @BC Football is going 11-1  isn't very smart. Trying to make things easier for him.
I know @Mr.StealYoGurl isn't because he's here 
I know a Nigerian prince who is a film produce. I'll give you his address and you can wire him the money 
I know all about the legal system and it's inequalities thanks to my good friend and lawyer @Skimmer 
I know all about third year. It's easy. You just chose hard placements 
I know all of the "rapists" on your power ranking
I know all of this from when I got my mba
I know all your med school friends 
I know becker would come if he were in Boston. Thanks for always being there for me 
I know both of you have commented on your pathetic excuse for brackets already, but I just wanted to hone in on the fact that everyone didn't get it wrong 
I know but that wasn't part of the joke 
I know Darrow must have because he’s a God amongst mortals 
I know everyone else jokes about it but I literally agreed to pay $50 months ago, before the season started
I know exactly who you're talking about Bocker. I am picking up what you're putting down. I catch your drift.
I know for a fact that Darrow is the only member of this groupme who smokes marijuana. No one else, especially those located in the NYC area would ever do anything as reprehensible as smoking weed and then steal your goddamn fruity pebbles. 
I know for a fact that Emyr doesn't partake in the devil's lettuce, because he never stole my fruity pebbles
I know Frank can't. He's too big to fit in an airline seat
I know goody doesn't support walking but I walked 6 miles on Saturday and worked 12 hours outside all day yesterday. Today put together a couch. There's my update 
I know he caught that, but what a horrible decision to throw that
I know he's a savant and a great athlete but I always thought Jameson Joseph needed to have a little more experience before taking over an NBA franchise
I know him and I think he's homeless 
I know how it started. I don't get Jordan's pov
I know how she feels. I lost the race for president for my national honors society senior year 
I know Hunt is the worst pick in the draft but he’ll be good on my team 
I know I am getting ripped off, but I will make up for it 
"I know I am late to the party, but this is in response to goody's comment about clicking because girl 

Reddit.com/r/unbgbbiivchidctiicbg"
I know I asked the other day but I already forgot. What time are you doing this again? 
I know I can't replace him, but someone has to make insensitive jokes 
I know I know! Pick me!
I know I know. Just busting your balls brah 
I know I’m in the minority here, but I can’t change who I am. I kind of love Dots
I know I'm incredibly biased, but I would rather watch baseball than basketball. I'm not sure if a lot of people would agree 
I know it can't work forever, but they aren't hitting the 3s either 
I know it now because you taught it to me 
I know it was discussed yesterday, but ESPN's projected draft values suck. 
I know it wasn't what you wanted, but Children's National is a great hospital and they are lucky to have you. It will be fun to come down and visit you and future Marcus/Shelbie/JJ! Congrats Bocker!
I know it’s not what you meant. That’s why I twisted your words 
I know it's a third world country but it would be more fun 
I know it's hard to tell, but joe doesn't actually have a baseball for a head. I just made it look that way 
I know it's not a typo but I hate it every time
I know it's not my money, but I would be completely fine with the Sox agreeing to pay 100% of their contracts for someone to literally take them from us 
I know it's only preseason, but white is going to be a good fill in for vereen 
I know it's probably fair market value, but just thinking back to the last couple of years, it is absurd that Case Keenum is going to make $18m/year
I know it's the media's MO to paint Mr. Kraft as a Trump-loving, unwoke, conservative, but he paid for the Patriots team plane to fly the Parkland School kids from FL to DC 
I know I've said this before but Olivia's cousins are conspiracy theorists. My favorite was when they told Olivia's sister, who was an elementary school teacher in CT, that Newtown was fake and Obama planned it to take away everyone's guns. Families were just pretending to lose children because the government was paying them. 
I know Kovin had a conflict until 7 so that would work for me. But I think the problem twin also had an issue with the draft being later
I know mine before I get paid for moonlighting 
I know more about the Olympics and America than anyone at the 99. Knowing ball is just a side effect 
I know my answer 
I know my friend goody too well 
I know Nick, every object exerts some amount of gravitational pull on it's surroundings. #NotMyNarrative
I know nothing about any of these players except the top 5 qbs
I know of a good one in Somerville. I realize that’s not Boston but if you’re interested, I’ll find the name 
I know of a researcher who left an unencrypted laptop with thousands of patients’ data on the T. I’m sure he was fired, but the fine was paid by MGH and not him. Don’t know anyone personally 
I know of at least two restraining orders that have been rumored to have been placed on Bill, so I wouldn't call him completely harmless 
I know of it from accidental brand name dropping on the Around The NFL podcast 
I know of Rahul.
I know of the movie, but had no idea it was a play first 
I know people that use it but it's beyond my scope of learning. I wouldn't know the first thing about applying it and using it correctly, or the science behind it 
I know people who have 
I know right
I know right 
I know right? Basketball.was ruined way before Durant 
I know right? I was on his side...
I know SNL is a controversial subject around these parts, but accurate description of Dunks customers:
I know some citizens of UNSC-defended colonies that would be overjoyed to have not one, but TWO spartans defending them from covenant armadas
I know someone who kills terrorists and presumably has the clearance to authorize a drone strike 
I know that @👀  never kids
I know that @👀 liked one of my posts, but he otherwise missed a good groupme day
I know that basketball isn't a real sport and that teams are weird, but i don't really get how Chris Bosh deserves to get his number retired in Miami when he played 125 more games in Toronto 
I know that Goody is anti Marc, but he and I share the same internal rage about most things in life 
I know that I’m always shitting on prominent Texans players, but I have to give some love to Watson for giving his game checks to cafeteria workers who lost everything in Harvey. That’s a nice move, you can tell he went to Clemson 
I know that Prima and@Witness  shop there, so figured I would spread the knowledge
I know that the probowl is a joke, but Tyrod Taylor? Eli manning? 
I know that there is a big beautiful bill and that Elon is “stepping away from politics”
I know that this has been posted 8000 times, but Joseph, could you please repost the list of reunion activities for which you signed up
I know that you are hesitant because Bocker will be there but the rest of the Fuckholes, who all love you, will also be there 
I know that you didn't contribute in any meaningful way 
I know that you just tagged him but my GroupMe says that there are only 13 people in here and he's not listed 
I know that you would never skim my messages 
I know that you're not a cat 
I know that....but Jesuits have a very different mission than Roman Catholics
I know the answer, so I will recuse myself 
I know the gender of our one future child, yes 
I know the OTs suck in the draft, but interior oline has some depth 
I know the pill is contraindicated in people with migraines because it increases your risk for stroke. So you have to pick from the other methods
I know the policy that they put out to the public said they were not giving refunds, so I hadn't tried either. I thought someone might have been more motivated than I was and took the time to call them to ask/complain/demand
I know these are real good teams, but we went 51 minutes without a first down last night! 
I know this may not apply to your situation, Anthony, but Olivia and I have mutually agreed to spend on experiences and not gifts, so we try and do a nice dinner or a nice event somewhere instead of buying things
I know those ubers add up 
I know we talked about doing something tomorrow, but anyone around to do anything tonight? Grab a drink somewhere or something? 
I know what detective work we're doing tomorrow, @#JustFacts✅ 
I know what else he may have to catch
I know what it takes to win!.....one game.....
I know what that means
I know what the Pacific Coast Highway is but have never seen it abbreviated like that
I know where you can get one: Amazon.com
I know where you live 
I know who my allies in this GroupMe are @AbadBot 
I know you are probably incredibly hungover, but you don't need to carry all that hatred in your heart 
I know you did it on purpose, but I dislike how you went from 1) to B) to iii)
I know you did, but I still had to point out that you were WRONG 
I know you don't mean that, Bocker.
I know you don't watch the Patriots like I do, but I hardly ever see Tom Brady extending while in the process of completing a catch
I know you guys have been holding your breath (no pun intended), but the FDA JUST removed N95s from the medical device shortage list. On 10/10, we don't have to wear the same mask for the entire shift anymore.
I know you hate the ACA, Jordan, but there was language in their that was set to pay physicians to talk to the elderly and terminal patients about their end of life choices and decisions regarding death. Republicans labeled it as "death squads" and the language was removed to allow the bill to pass. Now doctors aren't reimbursed for their time and many terminal and elderly patients don't get the necessary end of life management that they deserve 
I know you have trouble comprehending but it actually says basketball sneakers 
I know you would have come if you were in Boston 
I know you would, Bocker. You’re a true friend. Be safe on the rest of your drive. 
I know you’re not going to answer me, but I just wanted to make sure you knew which Fuckhole has the best high school football team in the state
I know you'll run faster than both your siblings
I know you're a strong boi now but he may be too heavy for that still
I know you're all trash human beings ( @Skimmer excluded), but you're all dead to me if that article doesn't get posted in the other GroupMe
I know you're all waiting for an update. A train finally came. Butt it was so full that no one could get on it. Still waiting 
I know you're asking for your future career aspirations, but they are integrated really well with the med student education during the clerkship which has been helpful from my perspective and I think it gives something meaningful to the residents too 
I know you're being sarcastic, but no chance that doesn't make basketball better 
I know you're going to reject it but I'm going to send it anyway in the off chance that you accidentally hit the wrong button 
I know you're great
I know you're in zone but maybe don't let Kelce get wide open on 4th and 2. No one within 10 yards of him.
I know you're joking but we honestly spend way too much on defensive medicine and have massive drug costs. Lots of costs that could potentially be brought down if the medical system was different
I know you're not that good at Photoshop, but I wish you would learn to actually make some of these "visual memes" real 
I know you're referring to always sunny, but was unable to think of the next line to quote 
I know you've been at home....I was making a joke by making fun of your career choice for not being essential
I know, because of Morcus
I know, Gainwell should have had far more points 
I know, I can't believe you guys are still talking about women's basketball 
I know, I love arguing semantics
I know, I reported it
I know, I texted my parents to tell them and they never responded to me. So I know they don't 
I know, other Joff. That's what makes it so offensive
I know, right Joseph? Fuck us. 
I know, that was hours ago. Either John skimmed darrows question or he didn't know Darrow was Darrow. 
I know, ward 3 alderman just said that
I know. 
I know. Because I’m #JustFacts✅
I know. But you never texted me that
I know. Can't rely on the chargers for anything 
I know. I am gunning for you
I know. I hate you
I know. I just said that 
I know. I was asking again because I'm not Jordan 
I know. It's hard being me 
I know. It's super annoying 
I know. Poor Devin 
I know. The rule as it exists sucks. I'm just saying that it would be nice if players were concerned about what they are going to do with their life after the NBA 
I laid plenty of wood 
I laugh at Bocker every morning
I laughed 
I laughed many times. I feel like the dinner party was very different from most of the office episodes I've seen. Like very different 
I lean cliche 
I learned about a thing called a "push present" last night. Did you allegedly get a push present for Shelbie, @🐟🦴🩻?
I learned from Sunday's ATN podcast that the Bills released a season highlight video and purposely went out of their way to not include Tyrod Taylor. Who does that? 
I learned from the best
I learned Halo was on Steam last week when I was bored and wanted something to do
I learned some excel formulas from YouTube videos too. It helps when you actively have a problem you need to solve but I don't know how helpful YouTube will be to just improve your knowledge 
I learned something today! 
I learned this year that there is a work around to the 26 year old requirement. But policy holder ends up paying a shit ton more for a premium
I learned today that my 4 weeks of public health classes are all going to be done remotely. I'm going to save so much on parking
I leave the state and the groupme ceases to function. SAD
I left NM out of my application pool. It was a hard decision 
I left one blank when I voted. I of course voted against rank choice voting because it's straight communism 
I left that GroupMe and now that refuse to talk to me in person. It's wonderful
I left too early 
I legitimately did not realize that people still used travel agents 
I legitimately didn't even consider that there was a 5th option until you just made me go back and look over the choices again
I legitimately don’t know who Marcus and Becker are
I legitimately don't get the Caitlin Clark is hot schtick 
I legitimately don't get what's wrong with that tweet 
I legitimately don't know what Siriani contributes to the team 
I legitimately have 2 yetis 
I legitimately thought that they were only for people over age 65 and toddlers
I legitimately was wondering if that's what you were expected to do 
I legitimately would but will be in stowe that weekend 
I let my typing skills fall by the laysaid -Jeremy Kaswer 
I lied
I lied, the orchard I go to is inside 495, therefore eastern mass. Carry on. 
I like a mix of both.
I like baseball. Hate basketball, golf, and mma
I like bocker 
I like Candice though. 
I like cold pizza but effective reheat methods produce a significantly better leftover product
I like Damien Harris
I like Darrow's suggestion better 
I like dynasties 
I like Fios. Is RCN any good? 
I like having Johnny Dash on my team. It makes me feel like I have friends. 
I like her name 
I like him for being an individual
I like how we took him off the scrap heap of the Yankees indirectly through the scrap heap of the Rays
I like how you fuckers like chan's comment but don't actually answer the question 
I like how you used the work trumps to talk about ignoring the votes of trump supports. Oddly fitting 
I like Joe's lineup
I like Joo
I like keeping the cert and it will allow me, if I so choose, to volunteer/work during the summers 
I like Logan Ryan too 
I like Lover of the Light. Guiding Light. Babel. 
I like Marc Sessler too much to let that happen
I like my Google pixel 2xl. 
I like my theory better 
I like my top two
I like my version.
I like peppermint patties
I like pineapple on pizza tho...
I like players who are good. Except for jj watt. Fuck that guy 
I like pod save america because I'm a huge liberal chick 
I like soccer but overtime should have never switched from golden goal 
I like Stafford. I like McVay. I like Kupp and Puka. And I do feel like good karma should come their way after the fires (even if I joke about them) similar to the Sox after the Marathon Bombing 
I like Szechuan chicken
I like that 
I like that hashtag. I'm going to steal it 
I like that nickname 
I like that one 
I like that the call helped the pats but let the boys play!
I like that Vrabel has a track record as a head coach. I like that he has established connections for coordinators and think that he will probably have someone good lined up for Drake's development. BJ is pretty tantalizing as an offensive mind but we have no idea if he's going to be good at being a HC since Campbell is very obviously the vocal leader in that locker room 
I like the cape getting wind turbines because I don't mind how they look and am in favor of renewable energy 
I like the famous wendeez nuts. 
I like the multiple topics
I like the pats pick solely because it puts another C Jones on the roster after trading Chandler Jones and cutting Chris Jones 
I like the play call 
I like the slug 
I like the stock 
I like the Tim Couch jersey one
I like them when they aren't wrong. Too bad this one is wrong
I like this article because it has bullet points and short paragraphs. Please take notes, @Dr. LT Kelleher .
I like to imagine Darrow as the dude in red and goody as the dude in blue 
I like to imagine Darrow just spending the day sitting on a bench in one of the galleries, just ruining every relationship that walks through the door 
I like to imagine it's from all the champagne he drank 
I like to know about my friends' lives independent of being in the context of a a tv show 
I like to start the day with a happy morning, thank you very much. 
I like to think I embody all aspects of the masshole individual 
I like to think it brought us all closer together 
I like to think it was for me
I like to think it's because Sanu sucks 
I like to think that anytime a gif of Donald Trump is posted in the groupme, Jordan has a violent gastrointestinal reaction 
I like to think that Chan has photoshops already made for major life events for every groupme member
I like to think that Chan pretended to skim just to give us content
I like to think that my diet is fairly healthy, but since I stopped working out consistently like two months ago, I've put ten pounds back on. I wish I had Bocker's metabolism 
I like to think that my good friend ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) does not cover up sexual abuse. Can't speak to the other members in this GroupMe
I like to think that she was hitting on me. While, that may be incredibly accurate in reality, it's a good way to get yourself through the end of the work week 
I like to think that the butt fumble is in BB's spank bank 
I like turtles
I like turtles
I like what you got, GOOD JOB
I like what you got, good job 
I like what. better 
I like when Chan and I agree because he was always my friend since Fall 2014 
I like when Goody fights my battles for me 
I like yoga. I like sex. I like the post-workout feeling but hate the peri-workout feeling. Probably because I’m incredibly unmotivated to work out. Anyone have a cure for that? 
I like you
I like you.
I like your meat 
I like your moustache 
I liked Chan's post then unliked it to show my solidarity with Anthony 
I liked it better when the dodgers were scoring runs 
I liked it better when your point included the chargers 
I liked last week’s GPI better 
I liked olberman when he criticized Goodell for mishandling the rice investigation but I didn't like him when he criticized tom Brady. I've therefore concluded the journalists are only good when they report the narrative that you believe in 
I liked the fried rice station because it was the easiest thing for them to make gf for me, hence why I got it every time they had it
I liked the idea someone had if replacing the Columbus statue in Boston with Menino
I liked the part when you made fun of Marcus and Bocker
I liked the second one...
I liked when you called bocker an idiot like 7 times 
I liked. Just saw Kristen 
I limit yogurt because of the sugar in it but Oikos has <half of what I normally see
I list a few celebrities that I like. Get told that I hate most of pop culture 
I listed to those on repeat when I studied in Fitz basement on Saturday mornings 
I listen to a murder podcast and they have a spin off show called Crime and Sports. It's all about athletes and their criminal doingsd
I listen to a ton of different podcasts and have never heard a commercial for seatgeek
I listen to everything except building the beast because college football players don’t matter
I listen to*
I listened to a podcast about how pork roll/Taylor ham came to be 
I listened to a podcast the other day that discussed internet domains and the podcast hosts didn't know what .com stood for either. I didn't realize that wasn't common knowledge 
I listened to half an episode a year or so ago. Don’t remember any specifics but remember I thought it was boring as fuck 
I listened to it but I have no clue who those people are 
I listened to mo Bamba got the first time this weekend and I think it's the worst song I have ever heard 
I listened to most of the third quarter in the car and have been watching the last 15 minutes live. I didn't see any of the first half 
I listened to Mumford instead and it was like @Beanboy and @🐟🦴🩻 were right there
I listened to that one this morning. 
I literally almost typed left right center before I reread the acronym 
I literally can only hear mama Goodwin's voice fawning over the picture 
I literally can stop cumming rn
I literally cannot fathom having a high degree of light saturation emanating from my phone
I literally cannot imagine that 
I literally can't do that
I literally can't imagine this 
I literally can't tell the difference
I literally could not 
I LITERALLY could not care any less about Colt McCoy
I literally could not care any less about your opinions on this matter. In fact, now that I know it bothers you so much, I’m going to post pictures about everything I do 
I literally could not possibly be less worried
I literally could type any numbers into this box and still get full credit for this assignment, so I am sticking with that
I literally couldn’t 
I literally couldn't
I literally couldn't imagine
I literally do not know a Kevin 
I literally do not know who Jeff is 
I literally don't know what our offensive line is doing
I literally don't know who "Marcus" is 
I literally don't understand what B school actually teaches you except how to apply for global entry 
I literally drank two bottles of wine and ate a wheel of cheese today. We are not the same
I literally had zero idea until you said something. Even if I did, I would not alert Jordan 
I literally hate every call Josh McDaniels makes in the third quarter 
I literally hate joe 
I literally hate you 
I literally have MD after my name 
I literally have never lost a world cup final 
I literally have no additional hope from reading that article, Joseph. Not even in mice models yet, let alone clinical trials. 
I literally have no idea what they are talking about and I could not possibly care less 
I literally have not seen gray skies for a week. This fucking sucks 
I literally have zero objections to the current method and thus have concluded my participation in this conversation
I literally just called it dinner three times, Channe frank 
I literally JUST got this article emailed to me this morning
I literally just parked here
I literally just puked everywhere 
I literally just reached peak orgasm 
I literally just read that tweet and was going to send it 
I literally just said I don't like bars. 
I literally just said it was a good defensive play...
I literally just said it was a question. I was asking if they put boxes in apartments as well as homes or if they just focus on home ownership 
I literally just said that 
I literally know of nothing else happening besides the Patriots doing Patriots things
I literally live down the road from Boston 
I literally live that every second of every day
I literally only recall talking about football in here today 
I literally said "I know I'm in the minority" therefore I absolutely can see how others can see it differently 
I literally said “it should be a catch in real life but it’s not because the rule says it’s not”
I literally said that they went any banned a ton of QAnon accounts along with Trump. 
I literally see him in the back of this picture with his hand up
I literally tell people about WAR being cumulative and affected by plate appearances all the time
I literally was just reading that article and was going to post it 
I literally would never
I live a sad life. 
I live for the Jordan rat-based posts 
I live in a 3 bedroom 
I lived 2 blocks away from their portland location (the second portland location closed) when I did my rotation there 3rd year 
I LOCKED IT UP
I log into my CHA G Suite to open the secure data file only to find out that someone inactivated my account 
I logged in for the first time in like six months a couple weeks ago
I lol'd
I lol'd at this. Chan is my hero 
I look forward to being able to call the titoons the titoons forever 
I look forward to eating lunch and then gorging myself on meats later, as I continue my spiral towards becoming a fat fuck 
I look forward to no one watching the video
I look forward to not watching that video in the GroupMe 
I look forward to our competitive and friendly matchup this week. I wish you and your squad the best of luck. 
I look forward to saying I told you so when a stat correct that names darrow the champion is applied on Saturday 
I look forward to shitting on Joe's team....again
I look forward to skimming the first sentence then asking for a tl;dr
I look forward to watching this after work tomorrow when I can sit down and enjoy it from start to finish 
I look hot.
I looked at the score at the end of the third and we were losing. The attending put the score up with 2 minutes left in the game and I was shocked to find us winning 
I looked at their site. Their hangover treatment is like $270 
I looked away for a few minutes? Did the Browns turn the ball over after the 2 min warning? 
I looked her up. Meh 
I looked it up because I had no idea what Chan was talking about. Apparently they are no longer allowing co-branding (putting company logo on their products) to companies that don't make environmental or community impact. Chan beat me to it but I am going to continue to type because I want to be heard too damnit
I looked to make sure it wasn't me who earned the scorn of @Skimmer 
I looked up his address to figure out how to get there tomorrow. It pops up in Google maps 
I looked up the answer after you told me I was wrong
I looked up the restaurant and they have zero indication about being safe. Not sure I trust calling and asking after what happened at Lonestar
I lost 4% in two days since the last time I looked
I lost almost 10% in my IRA 
I lost the game.

I love Dan but Mark is definitely my favorite. I like Gregg's Pats homerism but actually don't agree with a lot of what he says about the Pats. Wess is funny sometimes but he's probably my "least favorite" 
I love Darrow
I love Dion Lewis 
I love Don Don, but he’s dead wrong 
I love everything 
I love Frankie
I love Frankie 
I love Godwin 
I love how Baker was just standing still in the back of the end zone 
I love how Collinsworth says that the Pats and Bills pride themselves on not turning over the ball. As if every other team is okay with turn overs 
I love how dysfunctional the Steelers are
I love how Goody got caught skimming and then tried to turn it around on John, who clearly did not skim
I love how he actively goes out of his way to prove that he and Taylor are best friends 
I love how he’s just refusing to acknowledge us 
I love how Jboss listed his house number and street name but no city or zip code on the Moses form 
I love how many Bills fans there are 
I love how much I hate Jordan's puns
I love how you ignored me pointing out your failure to proofread your post 
I LOVE IT
I love it
I love it 
I love it. 
I love Jarvis Landry 
"I love Jeff Howe. In response to the ""where is roger"" chant:

@jeffphowe: Guys, he was at the last two home games."
I love JL trying to stroke Kanye's ego to seduce him 
I love Joff
I love Joff
I love Joff
I love Joff 
I love Joff and Tom Brady 
I love Joff. 
I love lawyer Emyr
I love Loco, Brandin Cooks, and Amy Raisman. 
I love Marcus Smart
I love Mayo. He's not going to change the tone of this team. Is he going to let BoB continue to run the offense? Big mistake 
I love Miss Peaches 
I love Mookie running out and taking the helmet off everyone who hits a home run
I love Morcus
I love Morcus
I love my 9ersssss
I love my barber, I'm not switching, just want to go less often
I love my job
I love my team
I love Other Bock 
I love pickleball
I love running up the score on the cowboys
I love Russell Wilson. 
I love Ryan Darrow
I love soccer but they have some very cringeworthy rules and I feel like they do it just to try and be different, even though their differences make their sport bad. Disagree with me, you can't. 
I love Somerville.
I love spicy tacos
I love sports. Football is awesome. I enjoy baseball and hockey. I don't like basketball, which is not a sport
I love tator tots
I love that everyone hates my bitmoji. I just fuels me to post it more 
I love that first quarter 
I LOVE that he looked at the coaching staff
I love that my future home state (and best state in the nation) made his vacation quite unenjoyable 
I love that screen call 
I love that you are you. Don't change. 
I LOVE the balls on BB to not put anyone back. Wish we had a luckier bounce but love the hustle
I love The Big Drake Bandit 
I love the ED
I LOVE THE END AROUND WITH EDELMAN 
I love the fuckswole bonding experience that we are starting the night with
I love the GroupMe because I love @Adam Chandler 
I love the Nerrs
I love the new picture John 
I love the scheme of having Bradley be the only one going for the offensive rebounds. 
I love this cowboys game
I love this trope of Fronkie's more than anything in the world 
I love thuney
I love Tom Brady
I love Tom Brady 
I LOVE TOM BRADY 
I love tom Brady more than life itself 
I love when @2021 BC Football (6-6-1 NC)  plays CPA stickler
I love when @👀  talks politics.
I love when they play the weekly voicemail from Keith. Sneakily the best intro song out of any podcast 
I love when you exist 
I love wine drunk Bock
I love wrestling
I love you
I love you
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you and your fantasy baseball team 
I love you Chan. 
I love you right now 
I love you too jordan 
I loved watching his dreams die in front of me 
I made a "toxicologist's handshake" reference during our toxicology talk in conference today and no one knew what I was talking about. Truly disappointing. Exactly the same as the prior situation 
I made a Pokemon friend. Her name is Emma. Olivia is judging hardcore 
I made a Spaceballs reference that no one on my team understood. I feel like @#JustFacts✅ 
I made brined, bone-in pork chops with a cranberry pear chutney, mashed sweet potatoes, and roasted delicata squash for dinner. Screw turkey 
I made fewer moves last year and had my best season at 6-8 (that sounds very pathetic now that I say it). Anecdotal, but I support your hypothesis
I made it better
I made it to Chicago if any of you assholes care
I made joffbot probably 2 years ago and never fully set him up. I haven't touched anything with the bots since then. I don't know where that message came from 
I made my clan in solidarity with Darrow for getting kicked. And he didn't even join
I made my own ice cream out of frozen bananas, 1/4 cup of low fat, lactose free milk, and a scoop of peanut butter. Basically the same thing
I made that for Olivia's family probably about 6 years ago. I've made it three or four times for us since then. I like it a lot more than Olivia does 
I made that image myself. Don't know what you are referring to
I made the mistake of a) going to the in and out a few blocks from the Hollywood stars walk b) being in the Hollywood district in the first place. The line was out the door and I still stupidly waited. Had to murder some people for a table 
I made the mistake of giving them my email freshman year.
I made the same mistake 
I mailed in my Arizona ballot weeks ago 
I make my own 6 course meals now
I make my own Chinese food, but I'm glutarded 
I make that recipe (just very minor changes) multiple times per year. It's gotten me many compliments and I always credit Kirsten
I matched. No insta story 
I may be able to make 9/16 work.  But I work at 7 am the next day. Currently booking vacation from 9/8 to 9/15, don't have flights yet so not sure when I'm getting back in 
I may be around if it doesn't rain, my roof would be open. If I'm around 
I may be misremembering that story of @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) but I don’t care 
I may be off by a few billion
I may buy and short GE stock the day before joe starts 
I may have just assumed that since her name is now Lapointe, she married his brother 
I may have 🐐ed fat panda 
I may just plan my bachelor party the same weekend as Bocker's
I may or may not being making up this narrative in my head but I want to say I beat you in mini golf in Avalon this past summer 
I may save the end piece to toast and have with peanut butter as a snack, but most of the time I just throw it away. Definitely would never make a sandwich out of it unless I was in an absolute bind. 
I mean every word of it 
I mean for the Lions. They had pick 6 but traded back and got Gibbs 
I mean he basically already sat out a year....
I mean he hasn’t been relevant in the league for at least 2 years
I mean he wasnt that likeable before he modeled his body after Patriots legend Trent Brown 
I mean he went on a golf trip when Caroline was two weeks old
I mean he's hurt. But no, it's not
I mean he's probably concussed but I really don't think that's hit to the head 
I mean his book is an NYT bestseller, so regardless of its worth, it clearly has had influence on society. He's pushed the boundaries of what an aging athlete can accomplish. He has a cult following in a large portion of the United States. He turned middle-of-the pack franchise into a decades-long successful business. I would argue that the popularity of the NFL is partly due to success of quarterbacks, and Brady has constantly led the charge on that front. He is a huge supporter of Best Buddies. He's almost single handedly deprived part of NY of happiness for almost 20 years
I mean I feel like she promised something the first time that she wasn't able to give. She owes him to try again 
I mean if they had Melvin Gordon, that would be a different story 
I mean it makes logical sense since they are loyal to the Pope (and the Pope is Jesuit), but I honestly do not pay any attention to religion
I mean it's not Severance s2, but it's good tv 
I mean it's not The Wire, but it's good tv 
I mean like tree runners vs. wool runners vs. the others
I mean Mac Jones 
I mean that's why you started tanehill right?
I mean the Cabal members have voted for Trump every possible chance anyway, so I am sure they aren't torn up about it 
I mean the dude is living with kardashians 
I mean the league almost died this year, so no way it survived next year. 
I mean they already have 
I mean, Boston is no Portland, ME
I mean, congrats! 
I mean, fair 
I mean, he does game #Civ6
I mean, he's been solid when he hasn't been on the disabled list 
I mean, how could you possibly be more wrong?!?!?
I mean, I can't blame him for the last part. The last nominee who really showed his cards didn't even keep his nomination long enough to have a vote 
I mean, I guess that constitutes physical activity...
I mean, I kind of wanted to know what it was until I saw the woman who was on the advertisement 
I mean, I love Emyr 
I mean, I really don't think it's that ludicrous. You are missing your first and second receivers. Your second tight end is managing an injury and has only played a handful of snaps the past two games. You lost your starting left tackle earlier in the game. And the jets defense was playing lights out. Your defense had started playing a lot better as the game went on. And I don't think BB was that concerned about winning this game, I think he just wants a healthy team 
I mean, I think "a ton of hype" is subjective. Geno auriemma is constantly complaining that no one cares about his team, especially when they were on that huge winning streak 
I mean, I would just choose not to hang out with you anyway 
I mean, if the play is dead, it doesn't make sense to enforce the touchdown dance penalty 
I mean, I'm alive, so I'm pretty sure I have a lifestyle 
I mean, it is basketball so...
I mean, NOPE 
I mean, obviously. I watch baseball every day 
I mean, once the Dems win and we begin sacrificing unborn babies and white suburban Christian mothers to Cthulhu, we won't have anyone else to vote in elections, thereby resulting in a Milton-like blue wave engulfing the whole US 
I mean, Paige's parents bought her a brownstone in the south end for her dorm room in college. But he was an oil tycoon and she 2as crazy 
I mean, scientifically it makes some sense. You're hungover because you're dehydrated. Pickle juice is salty, so you retain more fluid in your circulation instead of pissing it all out. 
I mean, she did get Toney cut 
I mean, shouldn’t have been a pick with a better throw 
I mean, someone just happened to wander onto his golf course where he was golfing with a firearm and was stopped by secret service. We don't actually know what the intent was. Maybe there was a gopher problem on the course
I mean, thank god. Just wanted to be sure 
I mean, that's all he was good for. Drops on key plays in the game 
I mean, that's unfair. India has like 36 billion people to follow Kohli on social media
I mean, that's what I would say if I was watching 
I mean, the awesome people with big hearts and large intelligences
I mean, the point of the SOTU is to outline an agenda... 
I mean, theoretically I could have been told where I matched today and it would make no difference for the people who have to SOAP 
I mean, two quarterbacks who were basically free. If nothing more, they are a stop gap until they can secure a solid veteran or they will suck enough to get a better draft pick
I mean, you can apply for literally anything you want but it's going to do you a disservice to apply to a broad range of specialties 
I mean, you can have a win if you want. That's fine with me
I mean, you can label all of the abortion clinic bombings a few decades ago as christian terrorism. And Eric Rudolph.
I mean, you're getting aroused at work, so not sure your professionalism was ever looked upon favorably
I mean, you're not wrong 
I mean, you're right @Skimmer. So glad you contributed. I appreciate you being here 
I mean, Zappe has revived Hunter Henry, Jonni Smith, Davonte Parker, and made tyquan Thornton into an all pro
I mean... Fuck you I'm rich as shit
I mean....whoever did this....wasn't us....
I mean...if you want? 
I mean...shit I thought I deleted that from Facebook 
I meant Alexander
I meant for @Skimmer 
I meant more like dying a billion times in the GroupMe buuuut 
I meant specifically why is he on the Busts list? Is it because he busted in his best friend's mom?
I meant that the ending of the game was lame 
I meant the GroupMe. Didn't even think of the league. Gosh, whole nother set of issues
I meant the restaurant. However if I was implying that they’ve performed the hazing ritual, I’m sure you would be correct 
I meant the whole CBA
I meant to buy a few today on my way home and forgot. Shame on me 
I meant to meme that picture but then hit post instead and now I have lots of regrets
I meant to say "I am now a big baller" but my phone autocorrected it. This statement is probably more accurate 
I meant to type Jack but then was typing borrow Jack from Frankie and somehow it came out as Frank 
I meant what I said. Deglategate
I meant would 
I mentioned the pick 
I message you in here twice, you don't respond. Fronk asks you a silly question about basketball and you suddenly are the most active member here 
I met her hundreds of times before that
I might be down, would prefer later time 
I might have to go and kill myself now. 
I might kill joe for me not starting Blount 
I might lose weight if I eat ice cream from all my explosive diarrhea 
I might not be in the best of shape, but my slide into home and 9 minute walk through LGA have been passed down in GroupMe lore for ages
I might plan on coming and insist on letting you know 
I miss @#JustFacts✅ 
I miss @bockbot
I miss @Channe Frank
I miss @emyrbot. He was always here for at least 14 days out of the month 
I miss @jordanbot

I miss everyone. 
I miss football. 
I miss him
I miss hooman
I miss Jake Brisket 
I miss Marco Rubio 
I miss Mookie 
I miss Pam
I miss politicians like Ted Kennedy. All he did was drive a hooker off of a bridge and kill her. He's the hero that we need 
I miss premed john. Business John is just as bad as goody and joe 
I miss Skimmer 
I miss that guy 
I miss that kid
I miss that kid. 
I miss the bots. GroupMe could have so many more posts
I miss the fuck out of you
I miss the Fuckholes

I miss the whip cream and hot fudge combo from white mountain 
I miss them 
I miss TWill

I miss Van Noy 
I miss when we used to shit on Joe 
I miss you 
I miss your patented catchphrase John. 
I miss Zoltan
I missed a couple 500+ Pokemon because I ran out of Pokeballs. Little miffed at that still 
I missed all the afternoon games. Can I get a recap of every single game?
I missed Chris Chan
I missed Chris chan 
I missed his statement. Was it that bad 
I missed how the GB game ended, can I get a tldw?
I missed it 
I missed it so much 
I missed it. Did he make America great again? 
I missed Julianne, Kristen, my friend Chris, and my friend christine. I'm a failure 
I missed like 75 messages from the groupme. Can I get a tldr?
I missed talking to my friend @Skimmer 
I missed that. Thank you Chan
I missed the actual injury. What did he hurt Marcus
I missed the conversation, so I just want to clarify. We still aren't doing participation trophies right? I have a great spot in my room for one, just want to know if I should keep it reserved or not 
I missed the most important day of the year yesterday 
I missed Van Noy 
I missed what happened because RZ cut out after the catch to go to the saints game. Did he fumble or get hurt? 
I missed you @Skimmer 
I move back June 1st 
I move to impeach goody on the grounds of fuck him. John for commissioner 
I move to impeach. Does anyone second this movement? 
I must abstain from conversations about food I cannot eat
I must admit that he has worked hard enough to gain the ability to lift the hammer 
I must say, I very much enjoy Johnny Dash's fervor since making the Fuckhole Final 
I must say, trump is doing a great job in his first ensuring that no republican president is ever elected again ever
I myself was pretty devastated at the time when we lost good old Todd Collins. Always showed up to do his job. But hey, have to look at the net benefit. How many lives has Tom Brady made better 
I need @Boe Jourque  to tell me how feels so I can feel the same way but to a slightly less extreme
I need @Jamie Bourque  to break down how I should feel about this trade, since he's the Pats insider in this GroupMe
I need a 60 burger tonight 
I need a Hightower touchdown more than I need air to breathe
I need a Photoshop of Freddie kitchens as the swedish chef 
I need a replay stat 
I need an officially licensed "No Days Off" Pats shirt (for sale at the NFL shop for a convenient $39.95) ASAP 
I need at least a months notice on the draft day if we do it in person 
I need Bocker to win this championship. 
I need Dan Hanzus's reaction and I needed it yesterday
I need Donald Trump to select Larry David's Bernie Sanders persona as his running mate. Think of all the skits SNL could write. Let's make SNL great again. 
I need Gronk to throw Burtfict out da club right now 
I need him to hit 63 
I need Morcus to beat Bocker in golf more than I need air to breathe 
I need more ATN Folk/Aguayo sound drops 
I need more James White on this drive 
I need my own meat men
I need nick Saban to have a recruiting scandal, leave for the NFL, then come back after two years to coach bc 
I need proof here 
I need scar, Matt light, mankins (minus 8 years and with a smaller contract) and a less injured vollmer 
I need some friends in this trying time 
I need someone to blame, you just made yourself an easy target 
I NEED THAT GIF 
I need the Vikings to lose so the Kirk Cousins folders under pressure narrative can get even stronger 
I need these fuckers scalped and offered as sacrifice to Lord Brady. 
I need this game to not go to overtime and my stream is a bit delayed and I'm so butt tight rn
I need this vaccine NOW 
I need to be photoshopped with a crying jordan face on top of the Tobin with Becker dunking over me 
I need to feel pain to perpetuate the woe is me philosophy 
I need to know how you ranked that to appropriately express my happiness or displeasure
I need to know if it's worth my time to sign up for a trial of this bullshit tidal shit just so I can watch it 
I need to know more about this assistant, Helen
I need to know so I make sure to show up 30 minutes late like @Ramblin’ Man 
I need to know what you think so I can pass off the same feelings as my own 
I need to know who to put 17 mortgages on tonight 
I need to own a small, family run winery in the middle of the Tuscan countryside like it was yesterday
I need to stay safe too
I need to stop taking acid 
I need to win this tournament if I have any hope of getting into med school 
I need Wolf and Mayo to off each other 
I need your opinion. I have this friend who is presenting a poster in Las Vegas this weekend. Not only did he bring his girlfriend with him, but his girlfriend’s mom as well. Is that a 🐐 or a 🐩 move? 
I needed a receiver too and have running backs and you didn’t ask me 
I needed hard data 
I needed that OT for a chance for another Brees TD
I needed to have at least one thing to complain about 
I needed to make it personal 
I NEEDED YOU FIRST
I never agreed to anything where I’d have to pay Joe 
I never buy candy on my own but will happily grab a mini candy bar from the unit stash if one exists 
I never claimed to be a sjw
I never claimed to be any of your friend
I never claimed to be better than Joe or Selena Gomez 
I never condoned that. I said business people should stop judging coworkers that get drunk at Christmas partiers
I never did a single dumb thing during college. I am and have always been perfect 
I never doubted Allen 
I NEVER DOUBTED BB
I NEVER DOUBTED BC 
I NEVER DOUBTED BRANDON SEBASTIAN
I never doubted Eli 
I NEVER DOUBTED JACOBY
I never doubted them 
I never ended up getting through, but apparently my dad did 
I never fail at a tush push 
I never forgot how fucking great you are
I never forgot how ugly I am 
I never get eevees. I only ever get drowzees 
I never got a real team 
I never had a razr, but I was late in getting a smartphone
I never had Bills before I was gluten free, but Bill's gf pizza might be the best I've ever had 
I never had your number 
I never heard that. I heard Gruden turned them down because he's 10 years out of the league and is an analyst 
I never knew that was a thing. If you say they're dope, and we both like pistachios, I'll have to try them 
I never left after they suspended Brady 
I never left your life, just took a hiatus to go to the library 
I never let him play with my ass...... I don't do that ever.... I stay away from that area all together 
I never liked Watt and Clowney because there was always so much hype about them, especially Clowney coming out of the draft. Clowney was always hurt at the beginning of his career and I always questioned how much he tried. Watt always showed up, except when he played the Patriots so it became a point to actively oppose the public nutsucking that was going on. Then Clowney started playing well and they both started helping the community and Watt raises like 60m for Houston and now my narrative looks bad but it's still #MyNarrative and I'm sticking with it. 
I never met her. I didn't think that there could be more than one Yolanda at bc
I never once doubted myself 
I never poop without listening to a podcast. 
I never pull out 
I never pulled a knife against @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) 
I never quit
I never received my assigned person
I never said 2-2 was my goal 
I never said anything about you speaking Chinese numbnuts. You can infer all you want but don't put words in my mouth 
I never said he landed a punch squarely on his face...
I never said he wasn’t really good 
I never said I was a good person 
I never said I was out of the woods 
I never said I wasn't cumming. My right hand will be working over time tonight 
I never said I wouldn't. Jordan is acting like she's a 10
I never said it was easy. I just said it was in 
I never said the gym was closed 
I never shaved balls in my day, but I have shaved many a groin of STEMI patients going for PCI 
I never think of Joe Bourque more than I have to 
I never thought that I would have to defend my legacy against Eli manning for a third time 
I never use yelp for restaurant reviews after South Park taught me all about their sketchy tactics
I never validated it 
I never watch any of these congressional things. Are they going to give every single senator 5 minutes to speak? 
I never went back after the sucking started 
I never would, bae ❤️
I no longer feel comfortable attending. I plan to Skype in to avoid being ass raped by the Fuckholes 
I no longer have debts with you animals. 
I no longer have the grammar nazi image, but imagine that I am posting it right now
I no one watches videos in the GroupMe, but the Dallas Stars actually played Sweet Victory yesterday:
I nominate goody to do that. He should have the time in between not applying to grad school 
I nominate the Bears because they were exciting last year due to their good defense, which I love 
I nominate the Patriots. #FuckTheRules
I nominate the pats
I normally don't come out victorious 
I normally don't negotiate. I let the buyers come crawling to me 
I normally head to bed around midnight every night 
I normally just rub one out and I'm fine 
I normally just use a courtesy flush and then sit for as long as I can. Really relaxes you for the rest of he day 
I normally see the team as separate than the ownership (who would be the one moving the team across the country). Like I hate John Henry but I'll still root for the sox if they moved 
I normally shit once or sometimes twice a day. I work out and then immediately have to shit and then normally will go again later in the night, even if I've already gotten my daily shit in
I not know this person, but he was the former fire chief in Stowe and Olivia's dad worked for the fire service for 20 years so Olivia's family was very close to them. I would not feel any obligation to attend, and instead would be here enjoying wings with my good friends, if Olivia had not asked me to accompany her.
I noticed all big business buildings leave their lights on all night. Why? 
I noticed it, I just didn’t think that anything you did was important enough to validate 
I noticed now. I was so wrapped up in my guess 
I noticed that Kovin also went to Rock Spot today, which as previously mentioned, is two blocks away from my apartment. I did not get a phone call or text message inviting me to join 
I noticed that you didn't like that first comment...
I now have a paid Zoom account for future use
I now have blue balls 
I now have service. I did not get shot today. 
I now know what Bocker felt like when he made the bone saw reference and no one knew what he meant 
I now realize that Frankie might not know about TWill
I now understand odds
I now understand the Jorf joke
I obviously bought my present weeks ago but want to hear what you guys managed to come up with 
I obviously don't know much about politics so I am easily sucked into the reports that the media has been putting out. Several media members compared the firing to when Nixon fired everyone after watergate. Would like a real political expert like jordan to weigh in 
I obviously have no clue what I’m talking about but I don’t agree with a scheme where you put your 3rd best CB on their best receiver for the first 20 or so minutes in the game 
I obviously haven't read and digested the whole draft bill and the podcasts I listen to haven't done it for me yet, but I don't immediately see how this limits costs 
I obviously know the context but I'll let someone else explain more clearly 
I obviously paid attention to your life very poorly 
I occasionally have problems where it won't let me tag the proper person or that it won't save/load likes when I open the app and I have to close and reopen 
I offer no worship to @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim 
I officially would like to include punters next year as well 
I often ask for meal modifications. But my duodenum is pretty much a bitch so there's that 
I often do burrito bowls but I like the idea of stuffing a bunch of corn-based bread products with meat and freezing them
I once got a hole in one and tied my good friend Bocker at the world renowned Pirate Island Golf
I once won Rick and Morty bar trivia so I am clearly the biggest fan out there 
I one a few, including @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
I only ask because I just drove past your condo 
I only ask because I just landed in your dump of a city 
I only care about @Skimmer and his opinion 
I only care about her HAPPINESS. And if that's dancing with scrony little fucks, so be it.
I only care about the Nate silver analysis
I only do hammer curls on the gym. Biceps or go fuck yourself. 
I only found her Halloween photos from her Twitter. Definitely less creepy 
I only got half of it 
I only hate the AFC east teams, the Steelers, and the ravens. Our division rivals and the two teams who have played us competitively during the ascension of our team 
I only have $200 draft dollars but I'd like to request some of Becker's, please. Thanks Commissioner Darrow. 
I only have 434 out of 1200 korok seeds. I only have 89/100 bubbel (sic) gems. I think that I found all of the armor sets but I still have to upgrade them all. I still need to find about 20 wells. My compendium isn't done yet 
I only have anecdotal evidence to back me up but there are a group of conditions that I think are really but inappropriately used to explain “symptoms” that are probably more supratentorial than organic 
I only jerk off in Goody's mirror 
I only know that I think that cs is clinical skills? 
I only like basketball players of the eastern Asian variety 
I only love half of that sentencre
I only message in GroupMe
I only play joe once. I was looking forward to kicking the shit out of his team twice this year 
I only recognize @goodybot
I only respond to the commissioner 
I only said what I said because you made me mad 
I only saw Amanda's pics 
I only sent it to the doctor's
I only started playing it again 91 days ago when I subscribed to the NYT crossword through Brown
I only support fake punt runs 
I only support the teams that #JustFacts*GreenCheckmark* supports
I only talk about things that directly affect my happiness. Millennials will find a way to kill World War III like they did malls and owning cars.
I only wanted to thank your wife 
I only watch sports where the athletes are arrested for assault 
I only wish I could be there in person so watch the torment flicker in his eyes. 
I only wished my roommate and his brother a happy birthday. I didn’t break any rules
I operate on a fee for service model. I'm charging Jordan per word 
I order everything from amazon and couldn’t survive without Prime 
I ordered another scan 
I ordered another scan 
I originally liked your post because I agreed with it, but then I remembered that you're a skimmer because we've already talked about Jed York's press conference, so I took your like away. 
I originally said no because I will have a small child, will be moving, and will be starting a new job but I have to say yes if we are getting an Italian villa 
I overall am happy that I bought it and I enjoyed playing it but probably will not ever play through again. Unless they release a new story line by dlc
I overthought the joke 
I owe Bocker my support for his support in Monopoly. Bonds formed in monopoly never die. 
I own 3
I own my typos
I own you 
I packed up and am leaving now to be with bocker 
I paid $10
I paid $35 for a tie, a suit, a dress shirt, and a dress for Olivia. Now sure how that breaks down but felt reasonable 
I paid no attention to the combine but everything else is correct about him
I paid off my student loans. And then took out 8 times more than I ever had from undergrad 
I pay $40 here
I pay $60/month for the cheapest Comcast cable plan and get a total of 40 channels. No HD. Extra $15 for Internet. I feel like I'm getting raped every time I turn my tv on. 
I pay attention to every word that my good friend @Double Mortgage Lock: BC -37 says 
I pay for my own Rock climbing gym membership two blocks away from my house
I personally am happy when the Patriots beat any 26-32 ranked team 
I personally am in favor of celebrating as hard as you want. If you don't want someone celebrating in your face, don't give up a monster home run 
I personally am not a fuckhole. That's derogatory. I am however a Fuckholes. 
I personally am not sure that trekking a 3-9 football team 3000 miles away, across an ocean, for a game is a great investment of time and resources. 
I personally am very happy at this hire. Very good choice. Hopefully BC will do enough to provide him every opportunity to succeed here
I personally do not ask for samples but I will allow one for the IDIOTS who don't know what they want 
I personally do not go on vacation to talk to locals 
I personally do not hate to see it. Mahomes is washed
I personally do not like the music that Beyoncé produces 
I personally donate to a Holocaust memorial fund everytime I open Twitter
I personally have never thrown an interception in an NFL game but maybe that's just because I'm elite 
I personally have never used a fleshlight so I cannot appreciate if there is a difference that produced an advantage, but if there is an advantage then I think they should be prohibited 
I personally like the dockside in Wakefield 
I personally miss them 
I personally never had a challenge finishing my work when I was working from home. I actually felt like I was more efficient.
I personally prefer the one in Hawaii 
I personally think he should slide
I personally think terrorist beheading videos are the worst but at least one person in the world disagrees
I personally think that shoulder dislocation reductions are some of the most fun procedures you can do as an EM doctor 
I personally think the first listed episode makes sense as a beginning and the last listed episode makes sense as the end
I personally would be as invested with a $10 buy in so you all pay $50 and I will pay $10
I personally would much rather have sesame chicken on a boat inside a building
I personally would never forget a person achievement from my good friend like that
I personally would not have him in my top 5 for the original cast. Maybe 6
I personally would not say that there was hype
I personally would prefer that all OTFers jump off the Tobin 
I personally wouldn’t say that I’m not friends, but I’m not sure that they’d consider me a friend. I started hanging out with a lot of the girls in there freshman year. I always got the sense that they never really cared if I was included in stuff or not so I’m guessing that their ambivalence towards me stems back from just considering me a tag a long and not part of their circle 
I pick number 2, with the chili con carnival thing as a back up if that doesn't work 
I pick the Ravens
I pick you Becker 
I picked a bad year to get into medical school. Now I won't be able to fulfill my dream of moving to a Scandinavian country with far more attractive women, better healthcare, and better internet with which to stream better porn  
I picked that gif in the hopes that you wouldn't make that joke
I picked the eagles last week Joe. I picked the pats this week. I am 0-2
I picked the first photo I could find on Instagram with both of you in it
I picked the wrong month to go to California 
I picked up your water bottle 
I pity @Big Baller Bour-Kay  for thinking that I bitched out, when really I am just focusing all my time raising awareness for domestic violence
I plan on abstaining from water during the whole trip
I plan on mailing it 11/6
I plan on pulling a becker and making joe wait until June 
I plan on sending them my med school acceptance letter 
I plan on visiting every strip club and charging all my meals to MGH. What could go wrong 
I plan on watching this video on repeat until I fall asleep tonight 
I plan to roll the dice and eat a whole baguette before the interview 
I planned it that way 
I planned on recreating every recipe on the Great British Bake off to enjoy with my afternoon tea 
I play by the rules written in the rule book 
I play on the app. You can't retry on the app
I played Fortnite last night and got like 6 kills between three matches. I'm getting good
I played one game of CoD2 competitively and my team got beat so badly that we decided to quit. Another good metaphor for my life 
I played two matches. Both times I died from some dude camping in the bushes near the edge of the circle. So lame
I pointed that out to everyone when I left like 8 years ago
I post a gif for bocker and he ghosts us. That ungrateful poopy head
I post this every time 
I posted about an opening in our 8 man junior year. You responded. We met you for dinner at Lower. We decided that we liked you better than Stephen Wu
I posted that about a minute before the lions ran back a punt. 
I posted the tweet with a video 
I pray for @Chancy Reagan  nightly
I predict that one of these people will be out of a job after this appeal. And it won't be tb12
I predict that the Dems keep the house and the Senate and take all of the Gov and AG elections 
I predict that the football season will be cut short due to the abduction of Baldwin by a terrorist organization, only to have Jordan rescue him 
I predict that the Jets are going to crash and burn tonight
I prefer "women's activity" 
I prefer detox teas. They flush the cancer out of my body before I even need fruit therapy! 
I prefer gold and copper as my method of choice 
I prefer Hong
I prefer Merriweather angles over kuechly angles 
I prefer movies about young men trying to better themselves in the suburbs. Like The Lion King
I prefer she did 
I prefer the current iteration of the GroupMe banner 
I prefer the latter 
I prefer the mode as my measure of central tendency 
I prefer the Ruby Tuesdays 
I prefer the safety from Maine that Becker liked to heckle 
I prefer the troll fire 
I prefer to ignore all shooty hoops
I prefer to think you're just bad 
I prefer under armour. Everything else is made for plebes 
I prefer way more hard hitting tv shows like The Six 
I preferred her in the ABC Family series Suites, the spin off of The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody
I present exhibit A
I present suspect #1
I presumed I did in the given scenario
I pretty much exclusively hate traveling for work simply because I am not a flying enthusiast, am limited in food choices where I go, and don't ever get to do anything fun. Plus I'm traveling with a bunch of lame people generally older than I am. I love traveling for fun when I'm going somewhere where I can be outside and see something really cool that I can't see back home. I'm definitely one of the people who likes to go on vacation and do things that don't involve sitting on the beach all day 
I probably could have made it to at least 5k if I pushed myself 
I probably have, but don't remember 
I probably make a recommendation to not give the vaccine to any women of child bearing age, as the six cases all fit that demographic. Keep vaccinating everyone else while making sure that they public is aware of what we know so far so they can make an informed decision about which vaccine to get
I probably rode them for ~1.5 hours cumulative and didn't spend more than $10 total when I used them in San Diego. Definitely cheaper than an Uber 
I probably would not want to be back in Melrose. Nothing really against the town other than it was boring as fuck and now it costs a buttfuckton to live there 
I promised parking as long as there wasn't a game. Best I can do. You do live in a town where another Fuckhole lives and will likely be driving from 
I purchased the wool runners. Thanks to all who contributed 
I put an arterial line in a manikin once, so what he did is basically not an accomplishment 
I put it all out there. If you don't collapse after skiing the hardest run of your life, are you even trying? 
I put it at 14%
I put it in quotes because I am not sexist
I put no stock in those difficulty rankings. 
I put some coal in mine this morning. Expecting some diamonds by the time our matchup 
I question that based on your actions against me at the junior year thanksgiving dinner 
I quit and opened back up and it was gone. Carry on
I quit the league effective immediately. Emyr is taking over my team effective now. 
I quoted that whole scene. No one knew. 
I ran into her at a football game last year (at least I think it was last year). If I remember correctly, she had decided to not apply to medical school and was particularly happy about reaching that conclusion, but she was premed in college 
I ran the Carolina Panthers once
I reaaaaalllllyyyyyy would have liked an invite.........
I reached out to five people for trades. Jordan is the only person who saw value in Jeffrey.
I read "the one with the blue people" and still didn't recognize that you meant the one with the blue people. That's on me dawg
I read a stat today that couldn’t possibly be true. The Red Sox are 7-1 against the Yankees this year and already clinched the season series
I read all but the last book. Not sure why I didn't read the last one. 
I read an open letter from students at Missouri to the 11 students that were leading protests about how they were basically acting like hitler. I think a lot of people are tired of their shit, and trump is the only one vocal about it. The other candidates are too PC
I read he had three offers from the pats, Texans, and someone else for the same value 
I read in The Heights that a BC senior died. That's really shitty
I read it the way you were intending and missed the typo. COVID brain is really getting to me
I read messages the way I want to read
I read on a blog that he was going to be good so it must be true 
I read one article about how he manipulated McNair during the GM search by praying with him daily, because they follow the same religion and that's why they hired Caserio and not someone from the search committee, who would have likely fired Easterby
I read one person's post on Reddit that said the Conor McGregor was overrated, so now I feel that I am informed enough about this subject to form an educated opinion: he sucks 
I read said study
I read some GroupMe post about some lancet article saying that 73% of people with "long-covid" never even had a positive Covid test 
I read somewhere that 80% of people in Chicago are being murdered and it's all Obama's fault. I'd rather not go there 
I read that as Darrow is literally made of metal with cogs and levers and shit 
I read that as fuckhole master. Either way, the statement is true 
I read that both players are going to sign with the Pats form the veteran minimum 
I read that he said that it was the NYC marathon but I do not get why he is asking about a bombing at it. Seems like something you don't joke about 
I read that they don't do throwbacks anymore because they need to keep the same helmet every game to prevent using throwback helmets that aren't fit as well
I read that you were the favorite if you didn't quit on the Fuckholes 
I read that. And then I read the next tweet which said that there was no way that the league would let the raiders move there. Then I read another tweet that they're already there scouting the area. So I have no fucking clue what to believe 
I read the messages after the conversation switched topics and didn't contribute 
I read this morning that the state cut supply to hospitals to concentrate supply at the mass vaccination sites. However, there are parts of the state not serviced by the mass sites where hospitals are by far the more accessible vaccination route. 48% of vaccines in the state have been given by hospitals, so you are essentially shutting down half of your vaccination efforts (which has proven to actually work) in favor of a handful of state run sites that are just opening
I read three different articles and I don't understand any more than that ^
I realize how much this is going to sound like Joe, but IvE bEeN oUt On BaRsToOl SiNcE tHeY mOvEd To NyC
I realize that's what you were saying, but I'd rather give you a taste of your own medicine and misconstrue your argument to fit my narrative 
I realized that I hate Townies and the 99, so by cheating, you're actually taking down two establishments that don't deserve to exist anymore
I really am struggling with mine. I feel like a french rap has to be from a Thompson. Feels more Kovin than John.
I really can't believe how solid Fitzpatrick has been this year. I would have bet that he was going to implode by week 6
I really could go for some popcorn now 
I really don't care whether it's daylight savings or not. I just find switching back and forth annoying.
I really don't get it. Unless they are shutting the podcast arm of NFL media down, someone has to produce the shows. He was the producer for several. Not sure how replacing him with someone else to do his job saves the company a substantial amount of money 
I really don't get Morcus's inability to realize that the FLB is a predraft award. Drake Maye had no hype prior to the draft. He was going to sit all year 
I really don't know what I think about an electronic strike zone. On one hand, it would improve call accuracy, but I just can't imagine not having a person call balls and strikes 
I really don't know what that means
I really don't know. A lot of the causes are genetic or microbiome related, and I don't think their characterized as actual diseases. More like certain genes are associated with obesity 
I really don't think her music is any good. I don't think her voice is bad. I think her songs are bad 
I really don't think the Seahawks pay marshawn the 9 mil they owe him next year. He'll be the starter for someone else 
I really don't think you're right about that, which means you're probably right 
I really don't trust tannehill either. Or Eli manning. 
I really have paid much attention to the forecasted impact, but I feel like it's going to put a lot of small businesses out of business or cause them to cut staff. Also, although I wouldn't base my decision on it, I would feel sort of slighted that I would only be making slightly more than the minimum wage burger flipper at this point in my life. 
I really hope @Jamie Bourque gets cell service back soon 
I really hope that's Danielle's number 
I really hope they lose out, fire Christian, and actually hire a good coach that shows that they're invested in the program. But we all know that won't happen. 
I really like my surface pro. Got it at the start of med school and it still works perfectly 
I really liked Halo 3. Hard to really choose against Halo CE because of that nostalgia factor though
I really liked Silo, Your Friends and Neighbors, and The Studio on Apple TV
I really need to proofread 
I really needed that 
I really thought I had you this time 
I really undervalued Connelly too. I knew he was good but I didn't realize how capable he was 
I really want Emyr to say that he's decided to move to the north shore 
I really want someone to type the response Jordan's joke before Jordan can just to make him mad.
I really want to know what you’re going to tell him 
I really want to like John Cena, but I can't out of principle because Joe likes him so much 
I really wanted to find a gif of a ref holding up the arm of the winner in a UFC fight but bing is a terrible search engine 
I received my MBA from the one course I had to take on budgeting as part of my MPH degree which I received in conjunction with my MD. Does that count @2021 BC Football (6-6-1 NC)?
I recognize Demetrius Harris
I recognize Goody's marathon as my own.
I recognize Misery Business and crushcrushcrush from Riot!
I recognize the hypocrisy of not saving it for the Fuckswoles Groupme, but I was disappointed with my weigh in today despite an improvement in my nutrition and ramp up of physical activity. I'll be going to the gym soon today though.
I recommend castration
I recommend googling a funny name. That always goes over well in here 
I recommend the Capital One Venture Card for travel for no other reason than free Peet's Coffee from Capital One Cafe
I recommend the King and I. Good Thai food 
I recommended Foggy Bottom, DuPont Circle, and Georgetown to Olivia and she didn't believe me and made me ask you guys
I recorded the 3am replay of it so I could watch this morning 
I reddit, would not have known
I reeeeeaaaally want Twitter to ban Trump's account just to see what happens
I refuse to accept any L 
I refuse to acknowledge that he is any of those things. 
I refuse to acknowledge that I was wrong even though your information is technically more "correct" 
I refuse to admit that I was wrong 
I refuse to answer that question until you respond to my message
I refuse to believe that there is not a type of cheese I would ever turn down (given appropriate dietary restrictions)
I refuse to believe that this man isn't a porn icon 
I refuse to believe you've never heard come on Eileen 
I refuse to change the reservation (because they said I couldn't) so if Johnny Dash isn't coming, Johnny Dash should be responsible to find a replacement 
I refuse to congratulate him until he meets the minimum 20 messages a day quota 
I refuse to consciously do anything that might bring you even a shred of happiness 
I refuse to fight @Fantasy Baseball Champion, Esq. 
I refuse to look it up. I’m going with telescopes
I refuse to replace my current slant bros, BoChangles Nix (From a Middle Class Family) The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) and 🧢ABot 
I refuse to step foot on the elliptical but have been using the rowing machine every other day. 
I refuse to support him in any capacity. I also don't listen to or read barstool anymore, so I have no incentive to download a PMT episode 
I refuse to text him first. If he wanted to talk to me, he would do it himself
I refuse to use Snapchat unless one of you jabronies sends a snap for some unknown reason 
I refuse to vote until the poll is amended 
I refuse to watch basketball ever again after this travesty of an officiating performance 
I refuse. I don’t want to bring any Fuckhole happiness 
I refused to give Joe any money towards some "pool." He clearly just was trying to pocket the money 
I regret everything
I regret everything about that 
I regret having such a terrible screen name. One of my top regrets in life honestly
I regret leaving the groupme if only for the inability to watch you guys make fun of them for being stupid 
I reject the notion that I am a nuthugger after just making fun of Goody
I remain wholeheartedly unconvinced by a blog post with a misguided theory that doesn't have the data to back it up.
I remember
I remember 
I remember 
I remember a day when JBoss could miss...22 times.
I remember a graphic a couple years ago about the lifetime win percentage of the bears and packers and it was tied then to
I remember Becker being very tired the next morning from making sure you guys lived 
I remember being really upset about not being able to eat real pasta. But now it's probably least important to me. I miss normal desserts. I miss being able to have good bagels for breakfast 
I remember Brooke and Pat but don't remember the last one 
I remember convincing myself that Zach Ertz was a good draft pick. Boy was I wrong. 
I remember Halo 2 being the shit when I was younger but was very disappointed by both the campaign and multiplayer when I went back to play it
I remember it being Kovin 
I remember it like it was yesterday 
I remember Kevin Wickersham made me send home Kevin to change from white sneakers to black sneakers when I was precepting to be a supervisor. Sorry Kevin :(
I remember learning about Hamilton in middle school but that was definitely only in the context of his banking work
I remember like it was yesterday
I remember liking it
I remember liking spaz as a person because he would take his kids to almost every BC hockey game. He wasn't a good head coach but he seemed to be committed to the school and appeared to be a decent human. 
I remember one kid in my high school who had a strong Boston accent. Don't think anyone else in Melrose really had one.
I remember one time sophomore year, Maggie and Katelynn brought everyone from our 8 man to a mod party (except Devin) and told darrow and I at the door that there wasn’t enough room. That’s the sense I get with anything regarding them 
I remember pre-21 goody didn't want to party too much so he wouldn't lose his scholarship 
I remember staying up til 2 am back pre-world series win. Shea hillenbrand hit the walkoff in like the 13th inning into the net above the monster 
I remember staying up til 3 am listening to a game that went into extra innings and he hit one into the netting of the monster 
I remember that 
I remember that Bocker hated me for being pro mask and I hated him for saying he would rather just get covid so he would be immune forever 
I remember that chick. Joe banged her in a big spot (he won't confirm that but I am spreading that narrative) 
I remember that. How you 100% came up with the idea yourself and I helped rally support around the rest of the Fuckholes to make it happen
I remember the first time I listened to Hamilton 
I remember the same thing as Joseph. I also remember some discussion of some women's event at dilboy stadium that was acceptable to attend. 
I remember waiting in line for hours after soccer practice sophomore year
I remember Wakefield had a punk ass kid that threw a brick through the McDonald's and punched a cop at a football game because he was smashed 
I remember we were talking about Dwayne bowe and whether he was still in the league... Browns have him listed as their third stringer, but he is making 9 mil guaranteed this year. Pretty good for someone who didn't catch a touchdown all last year 
I remember what happened last time we traded for a tight end in the offseason 
I remember when another Boston team, facing postseason elimination, didn't have a chance because they're opponent was bringing in the best closer in history. If I remember correctly, that team went on to win four straight games and a World Series championship. Bold move by Miami to bring in their ace closer. They should pay more attention to history. Essentially 0% chance we don't win
I remember when I applied to Northwestern. Good times, good times.
I remember when I didn't know how to spell Zika 
I remember when I moved to a different New England state and instantly started ghosting the GroupMe. Oh wait....
I remember when I only had 4 builders 
I remember when Joe used to manage the bots, yes. The rest is hazy
I remember when the white people at BC were mad at the university for not taking a stand too 
I remember when we all hates Erica as a producer. Now I'm clamoring for her to get more airtime every show. She might be the funniest person on the podcast 
I remember when we had an offense. Those were the good old days
I remember. I can only imagine how crazy that was
I repeat what I said last week, that Murray guy sucks 
I replaced you guys with new friends from my MBA program 
I reported the shit out of him 
I requested this day off four months ago because I knew it would be critical to my life as an American
I require no one’s approval except for Bocker and Emyr 
I rescind my comment 
I resent that 
I resent that. I do not like motorcycles 
I resent this. Joff be horny as hell and proud to admit it
I reserve my right as an American to not disclose for whom I voted 
I respect Chan and all of his #Narratives. I do not respect those of Anthony Goodwin
I respect democracy
I respect four people on that list 
I respect him as a player. He's great. I don't have to like him as a personality. 
I respect how calm he looks as the life drains from his eyes 
I respect my opponent. I will not talk about either outcome. 
I respect my opponent. I will not talk about either outcome. 
I respect our creative differences 
I respect real news stations, unlike my liberal cuck friend Jordan
I respect that 
I respect that choice, and I respect you 
I respect your intellect which is far greater than my own 
I respect your spinning of the narrative 
I respectfully disagree with your draft rankings goody 
I responded
I responded
I responded 
I responded 
I responded and I was actually busy all day 
I responded in my head 
I responded in the GroupMe 
I retract my previous accusations against Marcus. I saw the snap story of the Starbucks wedding, so he must consider us friends. 
I retract my statement
I retract my statement
I retract my statement about Bocker working hard. He's actually working on getting his thesis published, not on work for MGH 
I retract my statement. 
I revise my answer to 8
I root for all fan bases to feel happiness and joy when they cheer on their respective teams
I root for my team first. Touchdowns are what count. 
I said 2 hours, not 20 seconds 
I said contact 3 times in that sentence. I should be shot for that 
I said everything, not nothing 
I said hi, introduced myself. Chatted for a free
I said I heard reports of protesters being dicks and getting maced
I said I was gunna do it and then I dun did it 
I said I'd come 
I said it first, my phone just lagged 
I said it was a hold
I said no-name D1 school 
I said our crew vs your crew. Learn to not skim 
I said pod save the world 
I said that
I said that I totally didn't chest
I said that my two best friends moved to DC and would be a great support system for me. And their husbands tagged along as well
I said the focus group was effective. I have no clue if these initiatives would be effective
I said the joke and then they started laughing and someone else repeated it with the motion of holding a microphone to his face 
I said the same thing
I said the same thing
I said the same thing 
I said the same thing a month ago 
I said the same thing lol
I said the same thing out loud 
I said this last week and no one appreciated my prediction 
I said this last year: I am not a fan of taking the ball out of Brees's hand on 3rd downs and goal line situations. He is still the better qb 
I said this whole time that Jordan swindled you
I said what I said 
I said yips yesterday 
I said, @Bryson DeChanbeau hey buddy 
I said, @emyrbot is always here 
I saved at least 0.78 lives today 
I saved so many lives today. I may get a national holiday named after me for being so awesome 
I saw a clear shot of the play
I saw an article about it posted but didn't read it. Tl;dr?
I saw Bock Boi burn a dreidel in front of Nock while reciting the opening monologue to Mein Kampf
I saw he had started classes there a few weeks ago. I wasn't bitter about not getting an interview at umass until I saw he had been accepted 
I saw it on the sidebar on Facebook. Facebook: more politically aware than the news. 
I saw it. I don't respect it.
I saw John vent on cams
I saw Mac Jones play for Wakefield High School in the 2011 Thanksgiving Day game 
I saw Macklemore last summer. He was still alive 
I saw many other websites that supported #YourNarrative but that means nothing
I saw on insta that they removed it
I saw people mentioning it on Twitter but did not see the replay. Got a vid? 
I saw something about it before on insta 
I saw something written there so I zoomed in 
I saw Tarik Cohen mentioned as the other offensive player 
I saw that coming a mile away
I saw that Darrow was listed as Angela's best man 
I saw that he posted it as I was 75% of the way through typing my message, I just decided not to delete it. Not a true parallel thinking 
I saw that on Twitter yesterday. It was found in a shed or something, right?
I saw that pick coming as soon as the ball was snapped 
I saw that they used he tender but not what the details were. That's fucking awesome. Why don't more teams use that 
I saw that. can he just be disguised as any Pokémon? 
I saw that. I was hoping they forced him to take a year off for being a doofus 
I saw that. Was it bad that I immediately pictured Chan and Bocker?
I saw the "wow" right after the ball hit the monster and thought it was a bad wall
I saw the episode. Thought it was quite an effective and poignant representation of our current sociopolitical landscape 
I saw the headline about it for the first time today
I saw the ref cock that flag and yelled FUCK 
I saw the screenshot. I still literally have zero clue who that individual is
I saw the title but as a rule I don't watch videos on Reddit. Takes up too much time 
I saw the video of him getting beaten. He was fucked up 
I saw what you all did to Marcus
I saw you pass cyan in the hall and then never saw cyan again
I saw you were typing and just ignored it. A Fuckhole is never wrong 
I saw you when I gave you your backpack 
I say no, post more. Marcus definitely says yes, too soon.
I say remote, not clicker. I also say make a u turn, although I have heard bang a uie many times.
I say that and Love threads the needle through like 4 people 
I say that as I eat gummy bears at my desk 
I say we hire Jim Harbaugh 
I say we settle this with super smash. Goody vs joe. 
I searched “ouch” and this popped up. Not the message I wanted to convey but needed to be posted anyway 
I searched my whole team on yahoo this morning. Projections between the leagues were the same +- 1. I don't think they are that inaccurate 
I second that denouncement and add on a denouncement for all people who cheat on super bowl squares 
I second the motion to publicly shame @Marcus Bauer's secret Santa
I see #ASMB as less of a judge of trends and more of a judge of individual posts. @#JustFacts✅  chan you confirm?
I see 2 wins
I see 7 Kevins and one Kovin 
I see a direct correlation between our offensive success and the number of snaps that Michel is in the game
I see a resemblance 
I see amendola more so than Edelman. Edelman just signed an extension 
I see darrow's son, @Flight Tracking Szn pretty frequently 
I see Goody deal with racism for the color of his skin everyday
I see him going to a bottom team to make more money 
I see it as a benefit he didn't get signed. I am not confident he would succeed in New England or that he is even that skilled of a player 
I See Kovin is not bike-curious 
I see myself as more of a Jesus Walks guy
I see myself as more of a Jesus Walks guy
I see nothing about Dillon 
I see one source indicating that the suspension was reinstated 
I see Teddy B is being evaluated for an elbow and head injury on Twitter tho 
I see that he didn’t actually want to talk about transcoding 
I see that Morcus showed up 
I see that the tweet says possible midair collision but it just looks like the plan explodes out of no where
I see the other groupme is talking about who got invited to the wedding....
I see the proposal as reasonable and would personally rather receive a check than a tax credit for demonizing the world with my offspring.
I see the zoom went well
I see them on the t all the time 
I see this wrong all the time, but technically: isolation is for confirmed cases, quarantine is for possible exposures. They are not isolating because that would mean that they would be currently infected.
I see three desserts but only two spoons. Can only assume that Marcus ate two of those himself 
I see you Colts
I see you right now 
I see, I see
I see. How was the dildo that goody mentioned involved?
I see. I have seen them all weighing in but I don't remember that specific episode or that part of the episoden
I see. They just must have not updated the excel sheet. Carry on. 
I seem to recall that there were no Saturday or Sunday roads 
I selected one of them and was told I was wrong for cowboys/jets. I can never trust this game again
I send plenty of other sad faces 
I send them to @Skimmer every weekend 
I sent him this. The other question was from some rando
I SENT IT FIRST. POINT STILL STANDS
I sent it to all of the football fans in the GroupMe because it was a football meme..
I sent my parents a couple pictures with Emilia and Leo (child of my friends Simon and Kerri). I asked her not to put them on Facebook because it would look weird if she was posting pictures of a kid that she’s not related to. So she cropped Leo out and posted them anyway
I sewed up my first two humans today. No one is dead yet 
I shall ask around. Maybe Olivia gets a copy through school too 
I shall only shop at Burlington Wegmans from now on. 
I share that opinion 
I share that opinion too 
I share tp with Olivia, not the other roommate. 
I should be higher up on the hate rankings 
I should be lower. I hate NYC
I should be no higher than 9th 
I should be sad, but not that sad. 
I should complain more often, good things happen. (Is it physically possible for me to complain more often? Is there enough time in the day?)
I should definitely just head to the Tobin right now 
I should do some sprints. I do try and add in a little HIIT at the end of each workout 
I should have been a radiologist and done telerads from Hawaii or some shit 
I should have expected that
I should have posted in the fuckswoles. I would have gotten the encouragement I deserved
I should have started Money Mitch today #IsThisReally2019?
I should let the GroupMe know that I found out today that I am working Sunday, not Saturday, so if it helps @Marcus Bauer  to draft at 8 pm EST on Friday, I am on board.
I should not get punished for being a real Fuckhole 
I shouldn't be subjected to this stress while trying to memorize all of the carbohydrate metabolism pathways 
I shudder to think that goody is the political advisor that we need....he was the only one...
I signed all my cases out to Kovin 
I simply believe that people who go bankrupt should not be considered for the grand prize. It's not like if you lose all your money in real life, someone will just give you money to keep gambling 
I simply warned Devin about the future potential of penis pictures. That has come true
I skied a full day without falling once. 
I skied my first black diamond 
I skim that groupme normally. I'm just as bad as @The Awbarn Bandwagoner 
I skimmed the basketball talk. Not sorry
I skimmed this whole GroupMe but I just saw the Vikings score and all I can say is YIKES 
I skimmer 70% if that. No shame 
I sleep with athletic shorts and a light t shirt or tank 
I slept beautiful while looking at JJ Watt's stat line the last two weeks 
I slowed down the replay and I don't even see any significant extension of his neck that could cause a neck injury
I smell a comeback 
I smoked pot with Billy Barnwell
I snap chatted from inside the classroom...
I snuck pork into all his meals during Hanukkah so the Jewish gods will smite him this week
I so haven't received an official invite so I'm assuming they haven't been released yet 
I spell it how it sounds. If that’s wrong, then her name is stupid 
I spend so much on gambling
I spent 15 minutes picking that song 
I spent all day in the OR cutting out babies and placentas. You don't see me going silent during a Pats game 
I spent my morning watching YouTube tutorials on how to build effectively in fortnight so I can keep up with my good friend Kovin. How is everyone else's morning going 
I sprinted there to try and catch an aerodactyl this weekend and missed it by a few seconds 
I squad up with them 
I squatted once 
I stand by Bocker's take despite his hurtful comments about me earlier 
I stand by my assessment
I stand by my statement
I stand by my statement 
I stand by my trade prediction. Don't see how I could be wrong 
I stand by my vote that I personally don't eat the skin but I absolutely do not think it is weird if someone does
I stand by what I said
I stand corrected but also stand right
I stand corrected, apparently Barre is home to the Vermont Granite Museum. 
I stand corrected. She did not live-tweet the locations of congressmen during the violent coup attempt, but instead Tweeted the movements of the Speaker of the House
I stand corrected. The column wasn't sorted. Fuck me 
I stand with @ABot 
I stand with goody and the troops
I stand with HER
I stand with you 
I start at 8
I start trauma on Wednesday so I essentially work, eat, sleep
I started during a summer job in high school. We went to dunks across the street every day. I never really drank it during the school year. Became more frequent in college. Definitely daily during my gap years. I drink it everyday because I like the taste and because I am not a morning person, and it helps
I started him in my two other leagues because I was winning by so much that I didn't need him. 
I started him in two leagues 
I started skiing the first winter I was dating Olivia. This is season #5 for me, but for the first two seasons, I only skied once per year. I'm getting better and can do blues but still not very good 
I started two weeks ago with a week of bootcamp. This is the start of my second week of clerkship 
I started watching when it was 7-0 and Love has not impressed me. He's been fine but his receivers have been open, or his RBs are breaking big runs 
I stayed up refreshing the game cast on my phone to see if my good friend @Gonzaga Basketball 2022 Undefeated National Champs would be okay
I step away for 2 minutes and miss Zo
I still actually have a skateboard 
I still believe that Tua has a higher season, although makes you wonder how many games the FLB would win with a good defense and a good coach. I don't think it would have been unreasonable to have Tua sit this whole year, but I can see what the media would say to that
I still can place some blame on Joe for expecting that to end differently
I still cannot get over Derrick Henry. What a great player. Guaranteed week to week starter. Just happy for my good friend Kovin that he has him on his team
I still can't believe your parents don't care enough about me to remember my name 
I still do not have my schedule for that weekend, despite it being promised by last week 
I still don’t get a decision to bench Butler the whole game. He’s better than Bademosi and better in coverage than Richards and he can tackle better than Rowe 
I still don’t know where Jordan is 
I still don't know if The very active GroupMe leader is moving to Vermont 
I still don't know what a qualifying offer is because Goody's post was far too long for me to care to read it
I still don't know what that means 
I still don't know why I was made to hold the rolls 
I still don't really get what IV is so I don't know the answer to your question 
I still don't really understand what any of the business people in the groupme do for an actual job so I don't know which business position to assign Jordan without being completely wrong 
I still don't think any of us have a clue what we are in for 
I still don't understand why no one is concerned about the ghost T
I still doubt if Morcus would move off of his line 
I still dream about that game 
I still feel like much of the seaport, Southie, and the underserved areas of Boston are not accessible by T and require busses to get anywhere 
I still hate you 
I still have eyes on Larry Fitz
I still have mine. Surely they will be worth something some day 
I still have no respect for you as a human 
I still have not seen @Skimmer in here 
I still have people going. I could very easily come back. Or set a new record low score. 
"I still have posts to catch up on but:
1) it objectively is stupid to hang out with anyone who isn't a Fuckhole
2) Jordan responded to a Facebook post
3) I played catch with Joseph after the first football game, as I knew him from summer soccer league. I then ate dinner with the crew and went to the boat cruise and mit party with y'all"
I still have that scooter in my parents' garage 
I still have the pull out couch so we would have places to sit 
I still have two players to go 
I still haven't gotten my invite to the league. When is the draft? 
I still haven't seen him denounce the shooter in Maine, who I thoroughly DENOUNCE 
I still haven't seen Seamhead and JD Vance in the same room 
I still haven't talked to him in person but he seemed to get really irrationally upset that I got upper and he was stuck on Newton lol 
I still hold on to my theory that if the Biogen conference never happened, COVID-19 just would have disappeared. Just like our fearless leader at the time said
I still just can't believe that the league won't move the Broncos game 
I still love you. Don't worry 
I still owe my share 
I still prescribe an X-ray before you continue running. 
I still take exception with you trying to claim that I said the ref was punched although I did not use that word in connection with that hit 
I still take the time to win an occasional super bowl in our madden franchise 
I still think I was right, despite posting after he answer was posted 
I still think that this would be a better option than adding Morcus
I still think there should be three timeouts per half. Make it like football. 
I still value John 
I still want to know if @Beanboy got his secret Moses assignment
I stole yours 
I stopped at halftime so I could go to bed. I'm going to finish the rest tonight after work
I stopped listening to them, but I did enjoy Pod Save the World. I personally thought it was less biased, as they had experts from national defense, state department, etc. on the show to talk about things going on in the world. People who actually worked for years/their careers in government.
I stopped watching the game. Please tell me that Alshon Jeffrey has scored no less than three 80 yard touchdowns 
I struggled where to put you because you are good with kids and would just have my child watch Tom Brady highlights but I can't have you teaching my child to be Revere/NJ trash
I studied all day after class then went to the gym. Why aren't you in surgery? 
I stupidly leveled up some my shit too early. Wasted many candies that way. 
I submit a 🐐 nomination for you and you call my a liar? I hereby rescind my nomination. 
I successfully allowed Darrow to win today too 
I successfully avoided all crime and most crackheads 
I suck 
I suck at PoGo because I don't live in the PoGo capital of the world
I suck at this. 
I suddenly feel compelled to sculp a replica of Michaelangelo's David out of the tree in my front yard. 
I suggest boycotting the media market that most closely resembles North Korea's state media and switching to a more American platform, like yahoo. 
I suggest you remove Joe Bourque from the groupme in solidarity of Kovin 
I suggested it for dinner last night and tonight and was vetoed both times 
I support @#JustFacts✅ 
I support @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
I support @Super Bowl LIX Planning Committee President 
I support anything an American company like fox does. 
I support funding men in black 
I support John's hot take 
I support my friend @Last Chan U. We have been friends literally forever since after graduation and I hope that he and his family are doing okay during a time that has been very trying for many Asian Americans 
I support my roommate, and thus the troops
I support revolution if bocker becomes president 
I support that
I support that. I'm PC
I support the Foxtrots more than anyone outside of the Foxtrots
I support the Patriots 
I support this
I support this 
I suppose I conceed that point
I suppose I might be able to fucks with that 
I suppose that’s true. Thank you for putting that into perspective for me. I just hate to see someone treat such a good friend like you so rudely, after all the happiness you’ve brought this groupme. 
I suppose that's fair 
I suppose you’re right. I’ll take my L 
I swear that we were told it was "fixed" earlier in the season 
I switch to nights tonight. Tonight is a true "pretending" shift where I am in charge of a whole pod by myself with no junior residents and the attending doesn't do anything. After that, I have three nights in a row where my junior resident is an internal medicine resident. 😭
I switched my bank to capital one so I could get 50% Peets coffee at the capital one cafe on my way to school. Since March, they've had a "happy hour promotion" where card holders get free coffee from 7-9 am every day. I have paid for like 4 coffees in the last 5+ months
I sympathize with this guy. That’s how country music makes me feel too 
I tagged you earlier and you didn't respond. You can't complain 
I take a lunch break. We almost always have an hour scheduled. Some people pull out their laptops and study while eating their lunch. I think that’s dumb. I’d rather take my mind off of the Krebs cycle for an hour 
I take back everything I ever said
I take back everything I said about Anna's and redirect it to Moe's 
I take back everything I said about Cruz 
I take back my last comment. Chipotle's revenue also benefited from gluten-free Joff
I take back what I said before. I agree with Joe. I would put John above Joe, and probably above Emyr 
I take being called a skimmer very seriously.
I take care of patients in my hospital
I take it back. Better with hoyer. 
I take it back. I am suddenly 100% for kickers
I take it back. My team is the best. Fuck Marcus
I take it back. Ridder is better than Lamar 
I take it that's a no
I take it the patriots aren’t going to offer him $14m/year....
I take my pants off one leg at a time, just like everyone else. 
I take offense to that. I am Mark Sessler or I am nobody 
I take pride in being the Al Davis owner that this league needs 
I take pride in ruining your formula
I take that back 
I take the dogs out, feed them, and then the dogs and I go back to bed for a little bit longer. But that will all change next week when my clinical schedule actually starts
I take the gif back then 
I take the Patriots 
I talk to her more than @Skimmer posts in the groupme 
I talk to my dogs. They are cooler. 
I tasted it over the internet 
I taught Bock Boi how to use Microsoft office products when I was his boss at MGH. Looks like I failed 
I taught him everything he knows
I teach adults, but good thing brain plasticity exists or I wouldn't be able to mold their minds like playdough 
I tend not to wish happy birthday to someone 3 months before their birthday 
I tested it 
I texted him a few days after he left 
I texted him to see how he was feeling. Chances the text gets lost in the 200 other messages to which he hasn't responded?
I texted Morcus personally. What are the odds I end up in the unread message abyss
I think @Alpha Twin © is dead. Didn’t even come in here to celebrate the fake punt run 
I think @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson needs to get relegated to the AAA GroupMe
I think @Former Ayatollah, current influencer is great
I think @Former Ayatollah, current influencer will be the financial driver of all Fuckhole projects after he sells his shares in SwiftApp (when it goes public) for billions
I think @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) is just milking it at this point 
I think 2013 meant the most, just being after the bombing and the role the team played in the community
I think a 1 score game with 4.5 minutes left in the fourth quarter is a pretty competitive sporting event 
I think a challenging part about a "second wave" in the fall is differentiating between COVID vs. other respiratory infections in mild cases. When patients become severe enough to be hospitalized, the clinical symptoms become clearer, but it's your patients who are febrile at home with mild illness who present a challenge. As Jordan and Bocker said, necessitates availability of tests for everyone with robust contact tracing measures
I think a lot of medical providers are for it. I think the opposition is those with strong religious convictions that believe that God can perform miracles and only God can decide who lives and who died 
I think a lot of psychiatrists are private practice, which increases earning potential 
I think Addazio is closer to 2 mil but that's based on memory and no source whatsoever, so I could be completely wrong 
I think all non rap fans could identify: Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Nikki minaj, fetty wap, Kanye
I think another argument against was that there are cases of patients who were given X months to live who survived well past that date or even overcame their disease. Medicine isn't a perfect science and doctors are wrong a lot of times. Which is why if I were drafting the law, I would want an independent second opinion to consult on the case before allowing PAS to occur 
I think anti-vaxxer propaganda should be banned from twitter and Facebook 
I think any investment that helps people is good. I don't think it necessarily has to be through charitable donation 
I think any non-patriots fan would agree that that play was one of the worst football plays in the history of football 
I think any of the remaining Fuckholes are acceptable answers.
I think any present issues would be at least partially resolved with a living, breathing document that documents all current rules
I think anyone who spends five+ years of their lives attaining a degree should deserve to go by the title conferred by the degree 
I think Bailey Zappe waved to me. Can't be sure 
I think basketball needs to have a good coach and recruiter to be successful going forward 
I think BC is missing a major opportunity to regain a foothold in Boston. They're giving that opportunity up to other programs by not putting themselves out there. 
I think Becker has been watching too much New York football with these low expectations 
I think Becker may have died putting his jeans on 
I think being a Broncos fan is a trend now. Oh I like to ski? I must like the Broncos 
I think belichick made the move that was best for his team because his offense couldn't move the ball and the defense held the jets to 34 yards in the 4th quarter. He put his strongest group out and it was a justified decision that lost them the game. I'm not saying it was the right decision, but he is 100% justified based on his reasoning 
I think Bocker is worse than Marcus rn. Should he even be in the Fuckholes?
I think Bocker might be the only person who would possibly watch trash reality TV like that 
I think Bocker wants to do it, John. 
I think bolden does need to be cut though. I hate when BB decides to put him on offense and he gets paid too much for special teams only 
I think boobs could solve 69% of racism 
I think both Biden and Romney would fair better (not necessarily be a landslide winner) against the other side's candidates. Both parties did a shit job getting their best candidate to run. And both of them had expressed interest too
I think both nights work for me as well but I think Saturday > Friday. Whatever is best for Jordan and bocker. Bowling is fine with me  
I think both of those concerns are currently debunked. From what I understand, china is actually doing a lot better with their policy and is trending in a much better direction than the US 
I think both the quitters are bringing this groupme down #MakeTheFuckholesGreatAgain
I think BPD will actually thank us instead of arrest us for murder 
I think Brady and the Bucs are actually going to win the division @emyrbot
I think Brady’s hand is fine 
I think Brian Waters did that with the pats too 
I think brown can run a lot of those routes. And obj can run (and actually catch) the go route that Brady keeps throwing to lafell 
I think brown just died 
I think Carota is John's girlfriend 
I think Chan just called all y'all the fuck out. 
I think chan should write our weekly power rankings. He's the only impartial voice. I am tired of Joe's egotism ruining this weekly ritual. 
I think Chan was confused because John mentioned Lexi's halloween party, which is this Saturday, but Chan inferred it to be next Saturday, when he is djing 
I think Chance the Rapper smokes "the weeds" though, and Emyr doesn't do that 
I think Cole Beasley would claim the same title 
I think Colleen Wolfe should be added full time. She's cute.
I think college rules are different than pro 
I think Conor Orr and Jourdan Rodrigue are great on HTC. I wouldn’t know how Jourdan compares on NFL Daily 
I think cucumbers are spicy
I think Darrow and I should be official score keepers, just to make sure everything is fair and unbiased 
I think Darrow is closer to Misty. He always makes yo gurl Squirtle
I think DB is going g to come too 
I think Dennis Clifford has more turnovers than goody has illegitimate children 
I think doughnut is official 
I think Drew Lock is garbage but I don't want to be mean to my friend @Negative Chancy Reagan 
I think dunks will be closed, which will certainly be a hardship
I think everyone else cares more about Darrowball starting an uprising than Darrowball cares 
I think everyone else here read Jordan's comment and comprehended what he meant. You're just nitpicking the difference between team and program to start an argument that no one is going to win and will make us all hate each other more.
I think everyone in the media thinks he's gone because Albert Breer reported that there is a supposed meeting between BB and Kraft tomorrow but other reports disputed that
I think everyone is having the same concern
I think fiber is the reason why the country goes shit
I think for next year we should change the scoring so joe can't score any points. Because fuck him 
I think for the sake of this investigation, @#JustFacts✅  needs to apologize. We need our witness back in communication with the investigation team.
I think forte is better 
I think Frank the cat murdered him for insurance money and is keeping up appearances by liking Instagram posts but can't type in here because he doesn't have thumbs
I think friendship has to be reciprocal 
I think game is swinging your way Jordan 
I think goodell is going to be murdered 
I think goody had this game sealed up. I hate to admit it 
I think Goody is getting married that day 
I think goody is scared that don Don might steal his girl 
I think Goody is the reason why @#JustFacts✅ is losing his indoor dining 
I think goody just admitted that STDs exist 
I think Goody makes some good points
I think Goody's knowledge extends past "a few" porn videos
I think Hafley is tanking for Wembanyama
I think hate him. I'm just going to choose not to trash him for a short period of time 
I think having 5 rebounds randomly fall your way over 82 games is easier than 20 points. But maybe that's just because I suck 
I think having a bag that said "My favorite season is the fall of the patriarchy" would be a more clear cut reason to dump a chick
I think he'
I think he and Don Don just have to murder her. If not, he's running the risk of another man being subject to this rhetoric in the future 
I think he bet on the bills 
I think he certainly did 
I think he did EM 
I think he got kicked out of the spa for jerking it while watching all the couples massages 
I think he hasn't looked impressive because he has been playing through injury 
I think he is any good
I think he is better than some but is it worth the distraction to the team to have him on the roster 
I think he is mistaking you running in the woods for skiing 
I think he just doesn't have to take our shit anymore since Broncos won the Super Bowl. It's not a hostile environment anymore. He will disappear again come September 
I think he just ruined Suh Dude for everyone 
I think he meant what does your social media timeline look like
I think he might have scored if he ran
I think he needs to change shoes/ankle braces/running style if he rolls his ankle on average once every other week 
I think he runs it back.
I think he should stay with the C's and keep playing how he's playing but only take shots when he's going to score and not when he's going to miss 
I think he skimmed is
I think he specifically said Olympic sprinter in 2 years 
I think he spells his name Joff
I think he spent too much time worrying about his balls and not his training 
I think he stays, but maybe not with the Broncos, to get records 
I think he was confusing the fact that he doesn't recline and you do. You are not one of him. 
I think he went down with the star ship enterprise 
I think he will work in a very specific offense. And Minnesota knows how to deploy that offense 
I think he’s a great coach but I’m 100% on board for a change at that position 
I think he’s as bad as he’s made out to be
I think he'll wait until after the round to slice his wrists from coming in last though
I think herzlich just died on that punt 
I think he's a great choice but MVP votes are cast before the game ends. No way to anticipate all that he does on the last couple drives 
I think he's confusing terminator and the matrix 
I think he's good enough to take a chance
I think he's just going to straight up stealing Kristen 
I think he's listening to advisors who tend to be isolationist. Helping the world environment goes against "America First" because it requires the US government to make sacrifices to adhere to the agreement. Plus it requires further regulation, which he hates. 
I think he's pointing at me!!!!
I think he's pretty squeaky clean 
I think he's retired but I'm guessing him anyway 
I think he's saying that consumers need to spend money on the environmentally friendly option, if that's what they believe in. And companies need to invest more in sustainable products for consumers to purchase 
I think he's saying that Kristen prefers the small things 
I think hicks will sign somewhere else for more money 
I think his possessions really should go to Prima, since she probably funded them all
I think I am qualified to say that was bad defense. 
I think I could get behind Todd Monken as HC with Mayo elevated to DC and Joe Judge shot from a cannon into the sun
I think I definitely should be given reparations for all the shit this GroupMe has put me through 
I think I did 
I think I got a little hard thinking about Joe owing you money AND me being right
I think I have a real shot to win this tournament 
I think I have said this here before, but there used to be a doctor in (I think) Arlington who was known to prescribe levothyroxine to patients who claimed to have hypothyroidism while having completely normal TSH/T3/T4. The doctor built his clinic to basically serve a population of people who look for fringe medical advice on the internet, then doctor shop until they can get the medicine they think will help a problem that they don't have
I think I have to buy an Alexa now 
I think I just had a stroke
I think I just saw him on the capitol steps 
I think I know how it's actually working out, but I also think I know how he's going to respond 
I think I know why but maybe you should remind me for good measure.
I think I lost 
I think I may have just watch Cole Beasley die live on tv 
I think I murdered Dobbins
I think I own all of the space in Bocker's head that Emyr used to own
I think I played soccer with him in the summer 
I think I probably went a total of 5 times
I think I push it through and hope Emyr is shooting himself in the foot
I think I remember playing that
I think I saw @#JustFacts✅ leave for five minutes during the game. I'd check his pockets. 
I think i saw that it's on again at 10:30 Jamie 
I think I saw them pull a knife on that play 
"I think I saw this on reddit years ago 

Arrested Development: smart jokes about stupid people
BBT: stupid jokes about smart people "
I think I see the issue here. #JustFacts*greencheckmark* recognizes true coaching skill, but we are used to actual good coaches. Good coaches are hired by the NFL and are successful. The rejects get relegated to college football. Marcus is so used to seeing subpar coaching that he thinks that Daz is a good coach but he doesn't realize that no college football coach is good.
I think I see you in that graph. Did you grow your hair out?
I think I still have my copy, willing to lend you if you'd like 
I think I’ll just keep on living. Probably my the most inconvenient thing I can do to you all 
I think I’m qualified after six budget and management classes 
I think I’ve lost three years of my life walking through Chinatown everyday on my way to school. Compassion won’t give me those years back 
I think I'd rather have a honey roasted turkey than roast beef
I think I'd rather have Adams on a long term deal than Gase for one more season before he gets fired 
I think if he doesn't pay by Friday, you are legally required to murder him and steal his identity
I think I'm busy Friday, but I was going to invite everyone over Saturday night 
I think I'm going to take up swimming and compete in the Olympics 
I think I'm in the same boat as Goody 
I think I'm supposed to denounce the fact that the flag is shaped like the US and not like a flag? 
I think in practice, the marketplaces weren't as successful and the current administration has made several attempts to defer payments to the insurers that allow them to provide a more affordable rate to consumers, so I don't think they quite function in the way that they were intended during the drafting of the ACA
I think in week 2 
I think it all has to happen to have each component work. Preventative care and appropriate end of life care would reduce costs. Insurance companies are then paying out less, so they wouldn't suffer if required to increase their reimbursement rates 
I think it depends on the consequences of the theory. No one is gunna die at the hands of Flat Earthers, but possibly will because of No Maskers and Fish Tank Cleaner Drinkers
I think it does. You can probably monetize yourself on Twitch now!
I think it goes back to the whole "you have the right to face your accuser" but Emyr would know more 
I think it is because SJWs like Goody feel like "illegal" implies that they did something wrong and should be in jail, which they don't believe is the case because often times immigrants are here illegally because they are fleeing hardship in their country
I think it is completely fair to question someone's moral standards if he/she/they/ze supports a candidate who has none because they might get to add another conservative judge to SCOTUS. I think that questioning comes in the form of civil, levelheaded discussion, not blanked disassociation
I think it is pretty much standard fact that there are other areas of the country with weaker economies than NYC and the DC area that could have benefited more from job creation than LIC. Putting it immediately next to a housing development does nothing to offer opportunity for growth to those individuals, and as Goody says, will only contribute to increased rent prices that threatens the preservation of their affordable housing.
I think it just means you're a homophobic asshole 
I think it makes a huge difference. There are definitely still people out and about
I think it means that Ryan is about to cuckhold you 
I think it sends a strong message to the athletic department/Leahy that they're going to be overtaken in the northeast if they don't clean house and remove the cancers that are plaguing the program 
I think it was a homework project for some class
I think it was because my dad was the assistant principal and he had lived in Melrose almost his whole life. I definitely did not have school pride by senior year
I think it was Bocker but I don't want to name names 
I think it was freshman year where we went to Newton and chirped the other team during some soccer games
I think it was from the NYT too
I think it was last year's playoffs, he missed part of the game with an asthma attack 
I think it was on espnU today? Or ESPN news. So maybe one of those stations tomorrow 
I think it was pretty clear to anyone watching the game that their intention was to throw it long. 
I think it was pretty disrespectful to Mitchell Trubusky vote Dak NVP. Dak lost the game on a poorly executed idiotic last play. Really takes away from the prestige of the award 
I think it was second round
I think it was you who asked about his feelings on p values 
I think it would be fair to wear one at this point 
I think it would make things worse to say "Hey, Ms X told me about what you said. That was really shitty." But I would not hesitate to call him out if he said something shitty in front of me.
I think it’s because isis claimed responsibility. 
I think it’s hilarious that the US isn’t going to be in the World Cup. 
I think it’s incumbent on him to try and come up with some formation or alignment that looks exotic to a QB who hasn’t had much playing experience at that high of a level. The pass rush seemed vanilla. I get that our front seven is trash, but I also don’t think you can say that he gets a pass because of it 
I think it's 3/month. My loans also autopay from my savings. Ipso facto if I was ever in a pinch and needed to transfer money, I couldn't without facing a fine 
I think it's an even worse look to be skimming a conversation in which you're actively engaged
I think it's because basketball has such a stellar offseason 
I think it's brand new 
I think it's cut off with 15 seconds left in the playclock?
I think it's fair to say that I am disappointed, but not upset and not surprised 
I think it's hard to promote the advance of athletics without complete buy in from the university 
I think it's helpful to look at this with the utilitarian principle. Legalizing heroin isn't going to bring good to the majority of people 
I think it's here
I think it's in the Boston college magazine that they mail out every so often. Mine is sitting unopened on my kitchen table and I'm regretting not reading it now 
I think it's just going to piss the players off more since NFLPA says they weren't included in the"compromise"
I think it's just you and us here now 
I think it's more of "you should treat this as likely until proven otherwise" to lean on the side of being ultra safe, but I don't think we know enough to say one way or another 
I think it's the latter. Combined with some hospitals paying nurses and other unionized employees hazard pay
I think it's worse not knowing whether or not I will have food to eat than it would be if I just knew they wouldn't feed me ever 
I think I've succeeded for 24 hours
I think Jamie is going to beat me. Should I kill myself now or after it’s official? 
I think jboss was the only Bourque to study abroad 
I think jimmy G starts if Peyton is on the pats. I think manning starts if Bill coaches the broncosn
I think Joe is proving Bock boi's point right now
I think Joe Kennedy's Senate hopes just drove him right off of a political bridge 
I think joe should get him 
I think Joe should submit his Fuckhole championship to jenn 
I think John doesn't want to pay money for food that isn't B12 shots of goji berries 
I think John had outside help. The posa gods are never this forgiving 
I think John is right that we agreed on the SATs this year. I'm voting for next year 
I think John was created in a lab to disapprove of literally every one of life's pleasures 
I think Jordan did Morcus's solely because of the Paramore song
I think Jordan is saying that Erin was offended by the bills sign and then called Jordan sexist for calling her bullshit 
I think Jordan just called Elway a racist?
I think Jordan may have to work for more than a month before he can get that up there 
I think Jordan would say that to someone's face without issue 
I think just Andrews and Herron, but Herron started at RT (he's at LT today) 
I think just keeping a consistent quarterback would have made a world of difference 
I think Kasich gives the republicans the best chance to a) get rep president elected (I hope to god people don't vote for trump just because he's not Hillary) b) save face from the whole trump debacle. That said, I really don't know much about politics so my opinion is probably wrong 
I think Kendrick’s coat is a bit overkill, considering he’s in a dome
I think Kevin should be in charge of medical care since he's the closest thing to a doctor that the Fuckholes have 
I think last week's game was so bad, in part, because you expect something of the two teams involved. I expect literally nothing from either of these teams, except for their coaches to be fired at the end of the season 
I think LeBron barrelling into me would.not be pleasant 
I think legalizing pot and legalizing other drugs are completely different things. For example, drugs like heroin and benzos Impact quality of life and function so much and are next to impossible to detox from. By legalizing them, you're pretty much ensuring that people get addicted and will continue to contribute to crime and the spread of HIV and HepC
I think Mahomes will just be way more fun with this offense. 
I think manning is used to being able to run the offense and throw how he used to. I think he is still learning how to play his game with limited physical ability. And he is smart enough to figure it out 
I think Marcus is ghosting us 
I think McIntosh was his last name but I have no idea what his first name was 
I think Michel is a reach at 31
I think my ass is my best quality but would understand if you guys preferred my titties 
I think my body type is more consistent with a FB right now 
I think my new career path should involve scalping tickets for this play. Sell four tickets for $400 above face value per night. I'd be rich 
I think my parents have a bottle in the basement
I think my parents took life insurance out on me when I was younger. In hindsight, it's a miracle that they haven't murdered me yet 
I think my roommate is having people over Saturday so I can't volunteer. I'm down to uber wherever
I think Nathan killed him
I think need minimum of 10-12 games played
I think Nick brings up a great point. I think that, unfortunately, most citizens of minority backgrounds tend to live in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods. The city definitely isn't as integrated culturally and racially as others in the northeast. I wonder how gentrification of those areas affects perceptions on race, with rich, white people moving into historically lower class neighborhoods 
I think Nock is too smart for the Feud. Most of the answers are dumb answers from dumb people.
I think normally Williams and then Amherst 
I think Nunez is dead but he is my hero 
I think Obama's law/decree is 100% correct. I just don't think it requires an executive order. Seems like most states can come to this decision on their own. If he doesn't like what North Carolina is doing, can't the justice system sue the state for constitutional violations? 
I think of his creepy mustache and his misogynism
I think of it less of "willing to take risks" and more of " you don't know what you are doing so you are being risky" but I can see how it is kind of semantics
I think Olivia and I paid $850/person for RT, nonstop to Rome but it was packaged with a hotel deal 
I think people don't fly on "privileged" airlines because they don't know how to be successful in life. Being privileged is a choice.
I think people like it because of the huge size of the map and number of opponents and it doesn't really have a big learning curve. Plus it is free
I think people should have the right to protest if they aren't hurting other people 
I think people still see Woodhead and assume that he's a ball boy who snuck into a player's uniform. Probably confuses the defense 
I think Peyton got fucked up during the Rams game and never healed. Which is why the Broncos decided to run the ball 30 times a game. They could win against bad teams but when Peyton got forced to actually play, he couldn't win. Just too old to recover from the smacks he was taking
I think picking Cannon might admittedly be recency bias
I think probably a teachers union GroupMe, a charter school GroupMe, a Cuomo GroupMe, and a "Against The Left" GroupMe
I think Randall Cobb will work out for me 
I think ranked voting is weird and it scares me. Not like "it's scary because it would damage the political system." Like "I have no idea what type of meat is in this school lunch and I'm a little nervous to eat it" kind of scared 
I think rapaports report was first. And I think he was basing that off of the feeling that gronk could play if needed to. I think Schefter was basing it off of sources saying that they would sit him to make sure he's 100%
I think Reddit is neutral and filled with lots of people with great opinions on political issues 
I think referring to the constitution is important for a country trying to stay true to its founding roots, but lose my number if you think that everything written in it can be directly applied today
I think Romney could run a functioning government. Arguably Obama could too (minus all the government shutdowns). I have no faith that either candidate can run a government because they've both fucked up most of the leadership opportunities they've had in the past 
I think Romo starts the rest of the season but I'm fairly convinced that they'll unload his contract after they lose in the first round of the playoffs 
I think she broke up with him for emotional motivation for this current tour 
I think she left you off the list, man. Sorry 
I think she’s single, you’d have to go to DC 
I think she's broken.
I think she's supposed to blow something else. 
I think she's the true love of your life goody. Forget freshman girl and Clemson girl. Go be with Meaghann. It's meant to be. 
I think SJW would take offense to the characters in this game 
I think so but the the article I read didn't specifically address it. Or at least didn't comment on it 
I think so little of Jonnu Smith that apparently I didn't even spell his name right 
I think so. Once
I think Taylor is literally having players murdered 
I think technically we’re doin abdominal exam/GU/rectal all on the same day. So...yes. 
I think that CMC scored all three touchdowns tonight, Bocker
I think that happens in some places for lower courts 
I think that has to be the biggest mid season collapse of our fantasy football history 
I think that he killed the others
I think that I can safely say that that was not a mistake. Darrow had every intention of putting $200 there 
I think that if Bocker had like 18 more inches on him, he could train and make it into the pros within 2 years
I think that number is 2 
I think that only covers half of it, goody. If GB represented a SJW, they would be calling France and US and Spain and berating them about how immoral their practices are
I think that picture made me sterile 
I think that posted twice. Apologies 
I think that since now rejected the offer, it should come to me next 
I think that that's a gross exaggeration Jordan. You are using white privilege to bring down oppressed minorities with your microaggressions. 
I think that the #ThirstTrapShooter is more qualified for this. Only a real professional can truly capture this feat bewteeen the two best athletes in the GroupMe
I think that the show is good, but I have not gotten hooked. I have not started season 3 
I think that there are pre existing conditions that prevent girls from going on birth control 
I think that there is only one way to truly see study this 
I think that they also do distribution for bars too 
I think that they are very intentionally not just checking the box. Vrabes might be their guy but it seems like they aren't doing a BS interview with a single minority candidate to satisfy the rule.
I think that they were saying that all skateboarders should wear a helmet. That’s my guess 
I think that was JBoss's prediction 
I think that we have them right where we want them. Can't blow a Q4 lead if you don't have one
I think that would be collusion. I would never do anything to skew the odds of the most important matchup of the season 
I think that you just send a venmo request to the school for the cost of tuition for reimbursement for the free entertainment that he provided, and then put "im fiddle kid" in the description 
I think that you were just watching the right guard. I saw at least 12 
I think that’s a downside to TV now. TV used to be a family activity. Something you looked forward to all week. Now you can watch anything on demand and it’s not as special 
I think that's a catch 
I think that's a really low percentage scenario 
I think that's a very fair perspective 
I think that's called aids 
I think that's called forced sterilization
I think that's considered the end of the esplanade park 
I think that's fair 
I think that's just friction burn from all the sex you've been having 
I think that's just the Covid reinfection 
I think that's legally binding 
I think that's not a touchdown but I can't imagine that they overturn it. So close 
I think that's sneaky number one 
I think that's the plan. I believe I read somewhere that they're going to allow trading of Pokemon and stuff too 
I think that's totally fair
I think that's where most of the fear lies
I think that's wrong. I scored more than several teams this week. I should have more than 44 wins 
I think the additional call was wrong
I think the answer is that everything is ramping up if it can, but no one knows how far they can go
I think the argument Morcus is making is that Hurts isn't competent
I think the bill is tangible progress in the right direction and I am very happy to see if the changes made have the intended outcomes 
I think the Blue Jays should have just hit more home runs and allowed fewer home runs
I think the Browns are in the double bonus
I think the Browns may actually pull this out 
I think the call was wrong 
I think the colts are one of the most overrated teams of the decade 
I think the correct term is "FOH" 
I think the difference between his production and Sandoval's does not warrant the contract they gave panda 
I think the fact that they were so close and still lost makes them more laughable 
I think the first couple episodes were hard to get into, Jordan, if you start from the beginning. I actually watched two episodes and stopped watching for over a year because I didn't like it. It gets much smoother and in my opinion much funnier 
I think the first couple of games he sucked because the Ravens sucked and they were playing from behind 
I think the full year 
I think the idea of a list is very fair 
I think the illegitimate one 
I think the last time my parents bought a set for their godchild's daughter, it was like $100 for a set 
I think the latter 
I think the latter, Becker. If I remember correctly, that used to happen to me 
I think the latter, but I don't think Trump has a good track record with any minority group
I think the lobster discussion really sold them 
I think the middle school team playing at half time scored more than bc has all game 
I think the most insane stat in that chart is that only 271 people died of the flu this year
I think the only feasible way to do it is to wrap it into the background check. Have to pass a psych exam along with background check. Logistically don’t know how it would work 
I think the only logical thing to do is to retake 26b and throw a Super Bowl party there 
I think the only thing you gain is having a firm decision made, which for some may feel better than wavering back and forth or having things up in the air. That said, I agree that there is no monetary or social benefit to calling the season today vs. 2 months from now
I think the PC term is dog governor
I think the people that have a high risk to move to heroin are chronic pain patients. A lot of patients move to heroin because it's cheaper and sometimes more effective than other prescription pain pills. If you increase access to heroin, I think more people would use it. 
I think the people who are recruited to play soccer at BC probably want to continue to play soccer. 
I think the perception of inferiority comes from the traditional opinion that DO schools are easier to get into 
I think the probability of surgery lies somewhere in the middle, but probably closer to needing it than not. The things that you have against you is that your fracture pattern is incredibly prone to rotation and displacement. In the second metacarpal, where your fx is, we tolerate the least amount of rotation and displacement of all the metacarpals. There also looks like there may be some extension of the fracture into the metacarpal head and if there is involvement of the MCP joint itself, then that definitely needs surgery. 
I think the problem is people are too quick to file a lawsuit when they could just fight and solve all their issues 
I think the serious argument would be that those don't disproportionately tax one gender
I think the showering of praise was half hearted. They didn't mention one thing about continuing to hang out with him or looking forward to still being his friend. It was all about their professional relationship with him 
I think the six is Sportscenter at 6 pm with two of the younger anchors who I hate 
I think the two or three of the songs on the playlist pointed me towards you but the French rap pointed me towards Kovin for some reason. I might not have guessed a Thompson if the French rap wasn't there
I think the WHO massively bungled the two major crises in the last decade (including ebola and Covid). The organizational aims are great, and a lot of what they do makes a huge difference in the world, but they are too affected by politics. The CDC is a wonderful organization that I believe has been stifled by a lack of effective leadership over the last 4 years. And they definitely screwed up a lot with the early COVID response. 
I think the whole reason we're discussing this is because her anger was unreasonable 
I think the World Series wins have spoiled us. I think we appreciated the great moments more when we were younger because that's all we had 
I think the worst part about that play is that they put the formation out there, then had a chance to change their minds during the timeout, but then still decided to run the same play
I think the worst part is them taking a young rookie along with them
I think the worst part of this loss is that I put up a respectable score and still got raped. Jimmy graham disappearing again didn’t help 
I think their wide receivers participated too 
I think there are many, many people asking if Tlaw is the guy after he got the contract he got despite never showing much of anything expected of him when he was drafted 
I think there is a law against that. Make the AG should look into it 
I think there is a loose connection between your earholes and your brain 
I think there is a question about charter schools. Right up his alley 
I think there is pretty consistent agreement among the epidemiologists that I follow/interact with that restaurants are causing at least some of the clusters, but that private gatherings are still far and away the primary driver.
I think there was a really important point, especially in the NYT article, about the consequence of underselling and how that would accept vaccine acceptance. Never really considered that but it makes sense 
I think there was a reason Hightower was a free agent until spiller got hurt 
I think there was something floating around recently saying that Providence was >30% parking lots and parking garages 
I think there were assholes on both sides. Mathematically though, the concentration of assholes was far lower in the 30k counter-protests than it was in the 100 alt-right protestors. 
I think they are censoring things that contribute to violence. I don't think they made the decision because he was being offensive
I think they are making an elaborate point that more things should come into play when selecting playoff teams than the conference in which you play. I don't think it is a troll job so much as an attack on the current way the NCAA works
I think they don't get asked to move positions if they are affluent black people 
I think they have a bunch of 3d printers and shit 
I think they just search all bags as you go in 
I think they know more than you becks
I think they lose a point if they miss field goals less than 30 yards
I think they said the chiefs
I think they should go a step further and imprison him and his family. 
I think they were so bad, Becker might drop off their bandwagon this season 
I think they won 
I think they would be trending downwards but I don't think they would have lost 25% of their user base
I think they're salty 
I think third quarter, but I wasn't watching either. Score was 13-7 chargers when he went in 
i think this is a good time to mention that Carlos Hyde is on the trading block for a stud WR
I think this is my longest stint ever having a gym membership 
I think this is what Gandhi felt like
I think this is yours 
I think this looks shitty. But I'm sure I wouldn't mind it after a month. 
I think this mine 
I think those are just Morcus's cupcakes 
I think those were both really weak calls 
I think Tony is a great person
I think Tufts had two but I never had to use one there
I think US has just spent way more money on the Florida parks because they’re directly competing with Disney World, which is so much bigger than Disney Land 
I think Utz is #1. Cape cod chips definitely up there 
I think Vader is like $80 or something crazy 
I think Vrabel is a good coach and would be a perfect guy for Kraft but I don't think he's proven that he can turn around and develop a bad offense with a young QB 
I think Washington was definitely more of a 4Chan guy 
I think watching Joe still have hope for bc basketball is the saddest thing I've seen all week 
I think we are forgetting how much we hate Goody today out of all days of the year
I think we are here 
I think we are ignoring that this is more than just Jordan taking. He's gifting two top-10 players to Joseph. IIRC, Chan tried to give me Rodgers and Gronk when he left the league the first time, and that trade was vetoed. Goody is maintaining consistency.
I think we can all agree that joe sucks
I think we can all agree that manning looked like he is 50. Serious question. Do Broncos draft another qb early in the draft?
I think we can all agree that no one in this groupme cares about the basketball world cup
I think we can all agree that the whole congress should just be replaced with clones of Seth Moulton, but that is a discussion for another day
I think we can all agree that the worst thing Biden did for his candidacy was not run 4 years ago
I think we can both agree that regardless of Kovin's opinion, the "loser" will claim that kovin is an idiot and his opinion doesn't matter 
I think we can expect to be a strong enough military power that we can just take oil and crops from everyone else. It worked out well for us in the Middle East, what can go wrong 
I think we could have gone for 100 if we wanted. Disappointed we didn't run up the score 
I think we could use a play action to Dillon...
I think we drafted another, cut him, and then he went to the (?) Bills
I think we easily deserved credit, especially since I had a personal picture of the building 
I think we have to kidnap Jack so he doesn't grow up learning to be a loser
I think we have to murder Morcus, guys. For JJ's sake.
I think we have to start thinking of the possibility of Emyr sabotaging you 
I think we homer'ed everyone out of the thread 
I think we just won 
I think we may take you up on that Joseph. We will at least park by you and walk 
I think we need a comprehensive review of Joseph's performance 
I think we need the honorable @Skimmer to weigh in on this legal battle 
I think we need to all move into jordan's apartment for the next few weeks 
I think we need to keep a registry of 🐐🐐🐐. I'm beginning to lose track of all the 🐐🐐🐐
I think we play it by ear and start it as soon as Shelbie's water breaks 
I think we postulated this a couple weeks ago. I just saw this headline and thought I would share
I think we should all be seriously concerned for Rex's job. His defense doesn't want to play for him. Redskins shitting all over them. Offense blows cock. 
I think we should be kicked back down to NESCAC
I think we should have an only kicker league. Takes real skill to determine who to play each week 
I think we should just take that list right now, put the bottom two in the Posa, and call it a day. Much less stress for everyone 
I think we should move to best of 7 playoff series. Might have had a better chance to not win the posa 
I think we should nominate Danielle Braziel as our leader 
I think we should poach a coach from an up and coming Ivy program
I think we should reinstate the SAT punishment just for this one year and then never again 
I think we should talk about how to graduate 3rd years early
I think we'd be in for that 
I think we're going to put down a deposit and hope we find someone before may 15th move in 
I think what @Boe Jourque is suggesting is that he is able to ejaculate if the female with whom he is having intercourse stimulates his genitalia using a method other than massaging with her vagina. These acts may not be amenable to females who are shy or less willing to engage in a broader variety of sexual activities. 
I think what cemented her legacy for me is her ability to make fun of Marc as much as the other heroes do
I think what he means is that he is so nervous, he has peed his underpants several times. He was soaked through his underpants and his pants and into his socks 
I think what he meant to say is that he bought 500 naked call boys*
I think what Jordan is asking is why tf are you slandering the wire 
I think what you need is a spinal transplant chan. That will fix manning a problems 
I think what you’re hearing is the death rattle from the seven gerbils they have been up there since Halloween 
I think winning the bball league should negate losing the posa 
I think with the touring companies, more people are seeing it off broadway so the NY shows are not as "popular" but I got the tickets through a presale lottery and their website still crashed several times. So obviously people are still into it
I think y'all are thinking of a different pirate themed golf course
I think you accidentally a comma 
I think you accidentally a word 
I think you are making this partisan when really we just hate assholes.
I think you are referring to a Bloater
I think you can extrapolate that statement out to: nobody is going to be happy no matter what happens to any budget 
I think you can have both. My take: if you adhere to the standards set by society, you have a right to be cared for. If you don't adhere to those standards, you lose the right. Same way I think about guns. You should have a right for the government not to take your guns, but if you shoot someone, they should be allowed to take your gun
I think you can just say Elon at this point 
I think you can justify trading Mack for two first rounders and not paying his huge contract if you come out and admit that you are looking to rebuild. What made me laugh was Gruden complaining that they couldn't get a consistent pass rush after they traded him.
I think you can thank Darrow for that 
I think you can trust that what the guy is saying accurately depicts what his source told him, while still believing that his source is being disingenuous
I think you could make a fair argument that there is a disproportional amount of minorities in a lot of career fields. I don't think it's specific to Hollywood. I don't think abstaining from attending the oscars is going to solve the problem, and I'd rather see other career fields increase diversity before Hollywood, since other professions actually matter in my every day life 
I think you could negotiate that up to 25k. He has enough money 
I think you could pick any three occupations and argue their worth in society and describe their mutualistic relationships between the three professions
I think you do care. I think it eats you up. 
I think you forget how things work around here 
I think you forgot to invite me at first and I got in before the brackets closed or something like that. I know I ended up making a bracket with you guys 
I think you guys are misguided in this. If I beat Jamie tonight, then anyone with more than 5 wins is eliminated from posa contention. Therefore, you want Blount and lafell to play very well. 
I think you have colon cancer 
I think you have to post it twice Jordan 
I think you have to retire, give up your license, and move to Uruguay 
I think you just have to be the type of person that likes that type of job (no shit Joff, that’s the same with every job); they were teachers for their careers and liked working with kids. 
I think you made a mistake, Darrow. Anthony Goodwin wasn't supposed to get an invite. Fucking quitter 
I think you mean “that never”
I think you mean can’t 
I think you mean figuratively died 
I think you mean sometime 
I think you meant "always be"
I think you missed Kevin Faulk, Shane Vereen, James White, Rex Burkhead, and Dion Lewis
I think you read the trade backwards. We're taking Brown from you
I think you should get to keep his car
I think you should give the South Park one a chance 
I think you should go to Ukraine to fight Russia. You could singlehandedly stop this war
I think you should probably wait until the last 3 slackers submit
I think you watched the replay of the 54 yarder earlier in the game. The 53 yarder to win the game was straight on 
I think you were being ironic and posting it sarcastically
I think you'll be particularly interested in the announcement made before the game 
I think you'll need a med kit when you eviscerate him
I think your game should replace ours. Our aggregate score will be higher 
I think your problem is taking character assessments from Matt DiOrio 
I think your team is great, Joseph. Don't let becker hurt your feelings. 
I think you're confusing team ops and EMS Jordan. Team ops and bcpd grab patients at concerts and bring them to us. Once they are in our care, we are legally required to treat and transport. It made us upset to when we had bullshit patients that weren't drunk enough to require treatment. Also, the university forced us to transport patients. It wasn't our policy by choice 
I think you're falsely assuming that everyone with loans is going to find a well paying job after college. Some people have jobs that don't allow them to make more than the minimum payment each month. And the way most job markets are set up, grad school is almost a requirement these days, which means more student loans on top of the ones you already have. And if grad school is full time, you something don't have the ability to pay while you're in school. As someone living at home with a well paying job, you might be able to pay 30k in a year, but I don't know many people who pay back more than a couple grand a year right out of college. That being said, there is no excuse for not knowing the specifics of your loans 
I think you're generalizing an entire city. There's been some pretty compelling articles pointing at the growth of the Revere/Chelsea/Everett area. It might not happen for a few years, but I think if you trend the progression of gentrification, it's moving towards that direction and it's only a matter of time before areas of revere get built up 
I think you're great 
I think you're mistaken, Darrow. Marcus only comes to tailgates like once a year, not all the time
I think you're onto something becks 
I think you're pretty much obligated to be in the news if you win 
I think you're real dad is in queens
I think you're right, but lose my number if you think I'm going to admit it
I think you're supposed to add "Joe Bourque's 🐩 adding skills"
I think you're the only one who didn't know 
I think you're thinking of Emyr, who mentioned that he fell asleep. 
I think you've squatted there long enough to legally own the place. I would just stop paying rent @AbadBot 
I think Zappe put on Mac's jersey for that drive. No way to tell them apart except that only one of them is actually good 
I think, by the way, we should be able to trade players for auction cash or cash for next years draft. It's like trading for a draft pick 
I think? 
I thoroughly denounce the play of our football team 
I thoroughly enjoyed his antics 
I thought @Fantasy Baseball Champion and @Ayatollah Thompson were the only Fuckholes who would go visit a city without a place to stay 
I thought @M. Stribling Bauer was the only one holding rolls 
I thought @Skimmer was better than that but it must have been all the second hand weed during first semester of junior year 
I thought a dude who was basically dead 24 hours ago would kind of suck...
I thought about leaving you off just to fuck with you but was afraid you may actually might burn my apartment down and then drown yourself in your rooftop pool 
I thought about people with similar body types to ninko. He's built more like a linebacker, and I think mayo is too old, and no way he would put Hightower or Collins in 
I thought all golf was reserved for the Killing the Environment GroupMe
I thought all Ross stores were high end 
I thought at first that maybe it would be better to stash him on IR and see if he changes his mind but according to the cap gurus, the colts lose more money by doing that 
I thought at least @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters)  would stand by me
I thought Bell was the best running back?
I thought DEI was dead
I thought for a minute that @Cod-Bod: The Trivia Master forgot to acknowledge my big, totally cool, totally legal brain yesterday. I'm glad he didn't let me down 
I thought for sure one of them was going to be Christine. Now I'm disappointed 
I thought for sure you'd pick Elmo so you could teach him to tickle your prostate
I thought going to a super team was a lame move that he could have handled better (I.e. told Russell Westbrook). That said, he’s filthy and seems like a genuinely good person 
I thought he and his fiancee called off their engagement
I thought he died last week. What a Warriors 
I thought he probably bought one after his strong raspberry year last year 
I thought he was a chargers/dodgers fan now
I thought he was dead 
I thought he was dependable?
I thought he was god, who transcends all 🐐
I thought he was rich 
I thought he was the one who represented the companies that did the bad stuff? 
I thought he went for more; I take it back becks. I admit when I am wrong and I am wrong 
I thought Henderson had some good plays early. Marcus Jones had some good PBUs. And then the CB blitz sack was lovely.
I thought his dad was a head coach there? 
I thought I heard that he got caught cheating on Lindsey Vonn too. That's truly an amateur move. He already got caught once, he should know how not to get caught. 
I thought I remember Marcus beating Joe once and acting like he won the Super Bowl. Joe had beat him like 24 times in a row before that 
I thought I said week 4
I thought I was a shoe-in
I thought I was supposed to get coin from the doge, but he's draining my stimi 
I thought I wouldn't mind Whitebread winning, but now that it's sunk in... Fuck. How did we (and by we I mean Darrow, Jordan, and Emyr) let Whitebread win?
I thought it did an amazing job of making me relate to the main character, and it definitely resonated with a lot of what I felt in middle school. For that reason I was really into watching it. At the same time, I kept waiting for something big to happen. In retrospect though, if some big plot shift happened, I think that would have made the movie a less realistic interpretation of eight grade 
I thought it was a quality game. 7.5 out of 10. I think that they left a lot on the table of what they could have put into the game and the finished product just seemed a bit lazy
I thought it was an above average show but do wish she sang live for more of it 
I thought it was because you could make fun of my glutarded small intestine 
I thought it was boring as fuck 
I thought it was clean. Borderline at worst /s
I thought it was closing 
I thought it was funny regardless. That's why you got a like 
I thought it was golf Saturday morning and draft Saturday night?
I thought it was just me. My like count is suffering
I thought it was Rubio who had tiny hands?!
I thought it was the Catholics and the Chinese that invented AIDS? 
I thought it was to joe too 
I thought it was well agreed upon that you were doing this Saturday.....
I thought it was WWI? The Revolutionary War happened much earlier than that
I thought Joe Bushee was Joe Bourque at first and was going to give him so much shit for liking that status
I thought Joff getting an iPhone made the GroupMe lit again 
I thought John was referring to the federal government recommending that charges be dropped in Adams's lawsuit at the same time as Adams coming out and saying that he's going to cooperate with Trump on immigration
I thought jokes were supposed to be funny? 
I thought Jordan just robbed me of my Fruity Pebbles. Turns out he's the reason why my meal plan was so expensive, too.
I thought Jordan spelled it wrong so I googled it with the intention of posting a screenshot of the correct spelling followed by:
I thought Jordan started fantasy Fuckholes. 
I thought Jordan was making a joke that Ryan was going to kill Becker's whole family 
I thought Kelce was better than Gronk?
I thought Kershaw was good?
I thought Larry Fitz never dropped passes #throwingshade
I thought lsu was supposed to be good?
I thought Mac Jones couldn't throw deep? 
I thought Marcus looked very handsome last night
I thought Marcus was bank rolling us? 
I thought maybe Mesopotamia-area countries would be able to grow grapes on the fertile land they had
I thought my evaluation was fair 
I thought of you while I cut open breast tissue 
I thought permit parking doesn't matter in Boston on sundays? 
I thought Pin-Ball Wizard could fix #24 BC Football is Going 12-0 but I guess I asked for too much
I thought she was doing a grad nursing program in NYC but it seems like she’s never in NYC.
I thought so 
I thought so too
I thought so too. Apparently they were at the White House today 
I thought solder was good, but not great. But after seeing how unserviceable his replacements are, we fucking need him 
I thought sugar ray was a good fit for modstock. I still don't know who real big fish is, miserable choice. Macklemore was the best out of the four. Hoodie Allen wasn't good in my opinion and was a horrible choice. 
I thought Syracuse was our "rival"? Why are we playing them so early 
I thought Teflon Don was fired 
I thought that he didn't work there because he jerked off on the boss's wife?
I thought that he died from all the high blows that he took
I thought that Joe rented a quaint Somerville studio from Darrow?
I thought that last touchdown was to Snead. I'm so thankful it wasn't 
I thought that subreddit got shut down a week or two ago
I thought that there was NO way that throw was going to have a chance 
I thought that they were supposed to be better than that bulls team that was the best of all time 
I thought that was a fun trivia question that confirms that the patriots are in the middle of everything important that has ever happened in history 
I thought that was a good play by Kincaid but instead he fucked up 
I thought that was just a Madden play 
I thought that was Marcus?
I thought that was only a Disney World thing 
I thought that was urine 
I thought that you came up with the idea for the GroupMe after you retired from being our fantasy football commissioner 
I thought that you said torture 
I thought that you spoke barcelonian
I thought that you were a fan of those?
I thought that's what I might have heard but cannot confirm
I thought the "huge loser fraud" that goody was referencing was bocker for not running his marathon 
I thought the buy in was $5? 
I thought the eleven likes represented a like from everyone except yourself. 
I thought the last update was that ACC was expected to move towards conference-only, but that it was not yet announced as definite
I thought the same thing 
I thought they had like -$20m cap space
I thought they said they were putting Lance in 
I thought this was fairly enjoyable, as far as SNL skits go
I thought this was going to be a meme video. FOH
I thought this was the league we were trying to score the least points?
I thought this would be something like Rod Dyrdek's fantasy factory where we could get rich off of doing literally nothing 
I thought Tom Brady was the MVP 
I thought Trump was supposed to save the economy though?
I thought we established that he never has skimmed the Groupme ever
I thought we had an agreed upon trade, Joseph. Then you go and change the terms. Classic Joey Deepthroats move 
I thought we should lose you number, not our own? 
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS CHAN 
I thought we were talking about Cartoon Network shows? Hey Arnold was Nick
I thought white plains was western Mass
I thought you all were cheering on Brandon
I thought you canceled your plans to come to dinner 
I thought you did get him?
I thought you didn't sleep?
I thought you got tacos after 
I thought you guys were having dinner in Bar Harbor to celebrate me leaving Bar Harbor? 
I thought you had a big boy job now. Also yes. 
I thought you had gluten 
I thought you lived in the mods though 
I thought you loved me for me
I thought you meant that he was super fat and thus had no neck but after googling it, I see that is not the case 
I thought you proposed to Colin?
I thought you quit this habit smh
I thought you said you weren't coming back to Boston until September? 
I thought you were a fan of Trump, Jordan? Didn't you play basketball with him that one time?
I thought you were a WNBA fan? A true feminist would have referenced Sue Bird 
I thought you were already there?
I thought you were coming to Vermont with me 
I thought you were going the weekend after that?
I thought you were going to jersey 
I thought you were going to post pictures of hot girls 
I thought you were making a joke that it was you who jacked this set of pods but unfortunately the break in did not occur on a Thursday
I thought you were more of a Tweeter, Snapface guy 
I thought you were supposed to wash it out and reuse it 
I thought your office moved 
I threw my phone when I realized 
I told a patient and his family today that he has HIV/AIDS. It was not lit.
I told everyone 
I told her to put in for 6 
I told him I would pass the message along, but it isn't the right apartment for any of the Fuckholes. Get your friends to rent it out instead
I told him that I hoped he felt like he was dying, I did not give him a birthday wish
I told him to go buy a decongestant and discharged him. Equivalent of dirt and Robitussin 
I told myself that too
I told prima that she has to make bocker pamper her 
I told the realtor to not sent me anything without a dope as kitchen 
I told them after I took the exam
I told you
I told you 
I told you fools to wait until Saturday 
I told you John's numbers were all wrong 
I TOLD YOU WE'D GET BLOWN OUT 
I told you, aiming for 7th place 
I tolerate you 
I too also am surprised that they didn't use the timeouts, as well 
I too also lost my streaks as well, also
I too also understood that reference as well, in addition
I too am also busy not running 10ks ad well 
I too am also unavailable 
I too am in favor for changing the SAT punishment. Those prep books aren't cheap. Plus the $55 test registration fee is a hefty investment for those of us on welfare 
I too browse Reddit
I too enjoyed that game as wel 
I too have also done that as well 
I too have also heard that as well
I too have an announcement as well 
I too have heard that 
I too have listened to that podcast 
I too have nothing against Nan. I should have stayed friends with her; I might have had a chance to get invited to her wedding 
I too have seen those exact reports
I too saw that on reddit DAYS ago
I too would start Brisket
I took 8 classes there. I went to Harvard 
I took a first look at that picture and was confused why goody would post something nice like that 
I took a shit this morning. Most significant event happening today 
I took a snapchat a little over a month ago of a sign on the t for a wonderful production titled "the slutcracker" and you posted in the groupme, unsolicited, that you wished to accompany me. 
I took care of a woman who sprayed herself with bear spray the other night
I took her to NYC for a day trip AND distracted the RAs while getting written up at a party so she could sneak out 
I took it in newton last time specifically so I didn't run into anyone I knew 
I took my dog for an hour-long walk in the woods today. It was a true feat of athleticism
I took my leave at the end of residency and then just pushed my start date to August to maximize my time off. I got a little over two months. But I can’t take any more time unfortunately
I took my punishment like a man and represented the Fuckholes with dignity and honor. How dare you question the integrity of a fellow Fuckhole. Shame upon your house Mr. Goodwin, shame!
I took my vacation week off around my birthday with the plan of going out west to do a few national parks but got told that Olivia's mom's birthday is more important than mine so we are going where she wants to go to celebrate her birthday
I took read reddit 
I took read reddit 
I took the bus the day before I was diagnosed with celiac. Not saying there is a causal relationship, but hard to rule it out. 
I took the financial accounting class. Dumbo 
I took the full exam. All four sections plus the essay. 
I took the written part of my boards this morning
I totally agree. Just listing the #JustFacts
I totally didn't vote for Rubio 
I totally forgot to read them, @Jordan Kelleher 
I totally knew that and didn't have to Google it 
I totally know what you're talking about 
I touched @Chank Hill yesterday 
I trade down for four first round picks and replace both tackle spots, get a DE, and get a wr1 
I traded Pschneids to the Bucks
I traded. 
I tried but Angela said no
I tried doing that, the results didn't come out to what I would expect to be normal. I must have done it wrong. I will try again. Thanks Kevin 
I tried for 10 minutes to send that as a gif through the groupme but it's too large to send 
I tried man
I tried on the day I removed him and the day he asked to be added back and yesterday's 
I tried to add Jamie back in but it says I can't. Guess he's lost forever 
I tried to call you to celebrate and you had your phone off. Douche. 
I tried to explain what it was to my mom. She did not understand
I tried to find a video of his three home run game but I guess that was before YouTube was invented? I can't find anything 
I tried to get you a job elsewhere. Dr winter didn't listen to me 
I tried to make that sentence as spoiler free as possible
I tried to post that gif earlier with the whole real estate thing (despite Marcus's good advice) but it's more relevant here 
I tried to sabotage John too, but I don't think it worked. But my plan involved a hamster, a tub of Vaseline, and miniature saw
I tried to say "I hate the asshole that surgery has made me become" but got kicked out before I could. I deserved what I got 
I tried to talk Lions football but apparently that did not make GroupMe lit 
I tried watching NCFOM twice and fell asleep both times
I tried watching the tv show and but it was already drastically different from the book 10 minutes in, and I was not having it
I tried...
I tripped into acid at my first phish concert 
I truly am not sure which part of the patient’s check in put that as the chief complaint but I have to hope it was registration. But registration tries to put exact words in there so I have to think that the patient came in and said “I’m having a problem with my anal glands” 
I truly cannot
I truly don't care for myself but I do feel bad for Olivia since she felt ditched
I trust everyone who doubts your story more than I trust you 
I trust goody 
I trust Kristen more than anyone in this groupme
I trust Miguel 
I trust that @bockbot hates both Fortnight and DBZ because they are animated
I trust that Marcus will not be able to disagree with a republican governor 
I trust the skill position players on the ners more than the Lions and i think Kyle has the potential to scheme up something to help Purdy with 2 weeks 
I trust the story even less seeing that ESPN is reporting it 
I trust this guy in this topic
I try and accommodate you by offering up the time you requested and you respond by saying you're not available during the time you offered. 
I try and do rules 2 and 3 normally. I'm not trying to diet as much as I am trying to change my eating habits to be healthier in general.
I try my best to get them cleaned every two weeks. Sometimes i have to stretch it to three
I try not to. It's hard when we are being mad at Morcus
I try to spark the convo with some good Emyr talk but nobody wants that apparently.
I turned it off. What happened
I turned it on and Mac threw a touchdown. You're welcome 
I turned on the Mute Golf feature
I typed that all by hand 
I typed the address wrong in my previous post. 2 park Ave, Somerville 
I understand every joke that isn't about Epcot
I understand everything
I understand if it's a long weekend, but you are forcing people to take Monday off or spend all night traveling. Maybe a purposeful play to prevent people who don't really want to go from attending 
I understand it now that you yelled it
I understand not having Biden run more than not having Romney run because biden's son died recently. But still 
I understand that argument Jordan and it is a valid point. I just don't believe that a player who loses 5 yards on a screen pass, because of bad blocking, bad vision, or any other reason, should come away with a +0.5 for the play. It was not a positive play in the game, so it shouldn't be positive in fantasy. I could entertain a half ppr but never a full point 
I understand that reference 
I understand the desire to pro right away, but if it's anything like the NFL where most players don't stay in the league more than a few years, it would be helpful to at least have somewhat of an education to fall back on 
I understand the image. I don't understand the context in which it was posted 
I understand the reference but you're trying to beat the last undefeated team in the league. Don't take a stupid penalty that makes it easier for the Rams to score 
I understand their concerns, but is it really logistically feasible to have every owner/GM in baseball vow not to offer “lucrative” contracts to players? And is it even worth it, given the heat the NFL has received over the alleged Kaep collusion 
I understand using your parents guy. I don't know what jordan means by going through the government 
I understand what you're about having more chances. But I'm showing you that the majority of the time, the game doesn't end on the first possession of overtime and it's a reasonable choice to make to defer if your team is playing well 
I understand why but if I go for it, I don't run play action. Literally zero chance denver bites for play action in that situation
I understand why ESPN fired him for not wearing a mask. That's just reckless 
I understood 
I understood joe. 
I understood the joke when I woke up at 8 am, but I preferred #ChansNarrative that John didn't know the word postponed
I understood your joke, bocker. 
I understood. I love BoM
I unfollowed Heather years ago. I think you know my opinion on CRPS
I unfollowed too 
I unfortunately am not around. Have a test on Monday 
I unfortunately am working because you didn’t invite me soon enough (would have had to invite me in April when my schedule was getting made) therefore it’s as if I never got an invite 
I unfortunately cannot make it. Got some family stuff to do today 
I unfortunately did not
I unfortunately don’t know enough to answer your question Joseph and don’t want to steer you wrong 
I unfortunately I have to work 22nd through 24th and cannot attend 
I unfortunately only have the Thursday to Wednesday off around my wedding, so I will be unable to gather during any FH hangout that occurs around the wedding
I unfortunately will be unable to do either 
I uninstalled Apple maps. Fuck that shit. 
I updated my trading block 
I use all the Microsoft products, but Teams blows. 
I use an arm band like the rest of America 
I use an electric groomer. No way I’m putting a razor blade near my hotdog and beans. I also shave my chest, no itch 
I use feta in some tomato/olive cold salads but I don't particularly like it 
I use grill mats for my stuff. I'd cook your stuff on the other grill without the mats 
I use my phone at the urinal
I use OneDrive now because it is cheaper for storage 
I use the app and subscribe and have the same as Bocker who does not subscribe and uses the web 
I use the same as Joe. I hate BoA, but I stick with them out of convenience. The card is great for me, but I could see myself not liking it if I wasn't invested in BoA
I use the same placement as Jordan. 
I use the side room for HIIT stuff almost every day 
I use your pillow case whenever I shit at your house mr Goodwin. If anyone is unclean, it's you 
I used the photo on knowyourmeme.com. Maybe your picture is wrong 
I used to and then Bocker kicked me out of it
I used to be for it but am now unsure. There's been a lot of podcasts and media attention about innocent people on death row, so my opinion is kind of murky and I think I'm leaning to opposing it more than supporting it. I'm not sure of media attention is just blowing it out of proportion or not, but it seems like a huge problem 
I used to do mayo, bbq, provolone 
I used to hate scallops, but then I learned how they're supposed to be cooked and what places are best to order them from. 
I used to have every mixtape from all of them on my iTunes
I used to know what was going on there but I forgot already 
I used to like peanut brittle topping as a kid but haven't had it in years 
I used to listen to the daily and up first - also preferred up first
I used to play them. Objectively not great
I used to pwn n00bs in a CSS league
I used to smoke blunts with Jonny Tillerman
I used to spin. I see no problem with it
I used to. Not anymore. I got used to not getting any good channels at Olivias apartment so now I just do other things, catch up on shows on Netflix/Hulu, etc 
I usually cook similarly to how Bock and Chan cook their meat. I use either an All Clad stainless steel or cast iron. I also have done the reverse sear method 
I usually get a brand called against the grain that's pretty good but always open to new things 
I usually go for a grilled mushroom, or mushrooms in a nice jus gravy 
I usually try to get hard first 
I value your opinions nick 
I very much appreciate Chan's Twitter contribution to the GroupMe this morning 
I very much dislike basketball as a sport in general so I wouldn't call myself a Celtics fan. 
I very much enjoyed Vice. Thought it was 100% an accurate portrayal of a bad man.
I very much like the proposal that Joe posted. Ideal 2QB system is Brady and Stidham. 
I very much understand how interest works and there is zero way that your math checks out
I vividly remember that 
I volunteer @bockbot as tribute 
I vote applauded. Don't hate the player, hate Dan Snyder 
I vote democrat and don't like Hillary. I don't subscribe to anything political on Reddit. I like Bernie 
I vote Emily. She did a good job when she took over for Bocker 
I vote for a blank slate 
I vote for commissioner discretion, as he'll likely side with the winner of the survivor pool. 
I vote for Mike lapointe
I vote for no goal. Don't want the worst lead in hockey
I vote for our madden 2012 lions franchise 
I vote for the People's Republic of Cambridge.

I vote to use Kevin's GPI as our playoff and Posa seeding 
I vote we don't wait for Joe.
I vote we get rid of kickers
I vote we still go to Monument regardless of Bocker's availability.
I vote you go wherever has the highest chance to get nuked during those four weeks 
I vote, in light on recent developments, that we change the location of the bachelor party to Valhalla, NY. we can all crash are Bocker's place
I voted against this 
I voted early 
I voted for my good friend Peter ButtChug
I voted for the candidate who I believed had a track record for supporting social issues that are important to me. Free college isn't going to happen in the next for years. I'm never going to be rich and am always going to be taxed, so it's more important for me to feel like I live in a socially progressive country. And like I said, I want a president who isn't going to spend half his term fighting changes that have already happened. I would rather elect someone who wants to focus on the future 
I voted Jordan. #Rubio
I voted no, for reference 
I voted. I know have more social capital than Kaep. 
I vowed to stop watching South Park after that 
I waited for 20 at MB a couple weeks ago. My dad went the next day and waited 30. Both right at opening at 7 am. But I went to Shaw's in Melrose in the middle of the day on Thursday and walked right in. They had everything I needed except meat.
I wake up every day with hope
I wake up for the day and somehow Dak Prescott is suddenly in the MVP race? What year is it?
I wake up so happy every day for knowing @ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) 
I walked to get lunch, caught a magmar. Then wasted 30 pokeballs on a raticate before it ran away 
I wanna fucking die 
I wanna know how much Marcus paid for that ad 
I want @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs to share his reaction to MTG saying that doing crossfit is how she prevents from getting Covid 
I want a Mondre and Blount tandem 
I want a recount 
I want a tackles, OG depth, and front seven support. Fuck me, right? 
I want a team with both Kittle and prime Gronk 
I want an AJ Dillon TD here 
I want Brian Flores to take over the Pats as HC once BB retires and Jerod Mayo to be DC. Troy Brown as OC. Bruschi as LB coach. Vince Wilfork as DL coach. Ty Law as DB coach. Randy Moss as WR coach. Ivan Fears stays as RB coach. Scarnecchia wheels his wheel chair out of the retirement home to coach the OL. Ben Watson as TE coach. Slater as ST coordinator.
I want Cleveland to lose to the Bengals so badly 
I want everyone in the league to succeed 
I want goody because he doesn't want it
I want Mahomes to be stuck with 1 forever. People already trying to say that he's the best QB to ever live. Want to squash that immediately 
I want money 
I want Morcus to explain himself
I want recognition for not being racist. 
I want so badly for this not to be a troll
I want so badly to invest in a smoker. 
I want that ball at the LOS
I want the j in the store name 
I want the review, as I will be listening to the album and want to understand what I am getting myself into
I want the saints to win because the Panthers are whiny poopy heads but Drew Brees is a boss but I also want Bocker to lose money. I'm torn.
I want to ask for context but I don't want to be labeled a skimmer 
I want to be 90. I want to be 200. 
I want to comment on the XFL declaring bankruptcy but I think that's too negative on which for me to comment
I want to die
I want to do a study that looks to see if there is a correlation between local essential oils sales and Covid rates. Maybe then we will know why California was hit so badly 
I want to fire Urburn Murhur
I want to fucking die. 
I want to go back to enjoying football for football again, and not worrying about how bad my team is. I tried to be better, but clearly that did not work
I want to go on the record and state that racism directed at Asian-Americans is bad and we should be talking more about hate crimes against this community. 
I want to go to the cookie dough ice cream place? Boom. Confections 
I want to hear more drama
I want to just tell people that life is painful, take some Aleve and get a massage 
I want to know who the person is that liked her posts
I want to make it clear that you’re all nothing to me compared to Tom Brady, who I will probably never meet and who will likely never know I existed. 
I want to say no but I'm afraid that will lead into a discussion that I don't want to have so I am going to say yes
I want to say that baseball needs more fights but then I'm walking into Goody saying "well fighting is the fourth most popular sport in the country so you should just watch that" 
I want to say that Brady had a lot of nice things to say about the Pats when he left for Tampa, but I honestly don't remember 
I want to say that Erin lives in DC but I don’t even know if that’s true 
I want to see Brees participate
I want to see Joe fight to the death 
I want to see more replays of 4th down. I didn't get a good view 
I want to see them have their hearts ripped out 
I want to set a record for lowest %
I want to thank John for preventing my god-awful performance from being the god-awfullest performance of the week
I want to work in a hospital and not in a clinic, and I was looking into critical care. Which would mean I would do an internal med residency with a critical care/pulm fellowship. I’ve been shadowing a neuro critical care doctor and have loved it and actually really love the neurology aspect so I’m going to try and get some more experience there and see how it plays out 
I want trolling 
I want whatever odds allow me to pay $1 if I'm wrong
I want whatever set up he has
I want you to have that
I want you to read it and tell me how to feel. That's how I do politics 
I wanted flacco but Joe took him. Brees is on bye 
I wanted the saints to pick Watson so the Browns had to trade for Jimmy G
I wanted there to be legitimacy to this so Flores doesn't get blackballed (no pun intended) for nothing, but I ain't convinced 
I wanted to make a joke about you being engaged and not married yet but then I realized that I would literally hate myself for doing that. 
I wanted to say: LOCK ME IN FOR THE FALCONS THIS WEEK 
I wanted to see more of Olympic, we only got to the part of the park closest to Seattle. Would have spent days there if I could.
I was 0% excited by this game 
I was 1-1 against Jamie this season
I was 50% correct based on genetics
I was 80% joking response, 20% real response
I was a big Lupe Fiasco guy too, but Lasers doesn't have as much replay value as Food and Liquor and The Cool
I was a dumb dumb. 720 math, 650 reading, 670 witting 
I was a huge welker fanboy when he was here. When he left, I never had anything against him, but I feel meh about him now. I do, however, still have a large signed picture of his first touchdown as a patriot hanging on my wall at home 
I was a mild fan until 1989. I didn't like Reputation, I thought it was too negative when it first came out. I got back into it with Lover. I lumped Folklore and Evermore together. I streamed Midnights on repeat when it first came out 
I was a real American who drank soda with American sugar 
I was a trendsetter 
I was able to afford eye surgery after what I won betting on the Steelers outright
I was about to be ripshit if they did not call intentional grounding on that
I was about to call you skimmer for failing to acknowledge we need three teams but then you proved me wrong. Becker was always on my Boda Borg team 
I was about to go get a cheeseburger and dump some beer and soy sauce on it. Now I am disappointed 
I was about to make that joke. Damn you.
I was about to say "Jeff Wilson getting the Jonas Gray vs. the Colts treatment" but now I feel bad for him
I was actually curious to know if that was illegal 
I was actually nominating Tom Brady's gluten free meal delivery service 
I was actually the second person to like it. I don't remember her ever being engaged before but don't know enough to dispute you. She wasn't a huge fan of me so we never really talked 
I was actually there in the back with my hand up. 
I was actually trying to kill you by causing you to become diabetic. I guess it backfired 
I was actually up at 4:30
I was actually very much surprised that the capitol police officer was placed on leave and did not expect that was going to happen. If that was a courthouse or federal building in Portland, and someone was shot attempting the same thing, I would like to think that I would feel the same way 
I was agreeing with you 
I was agreeing with you that the placebo effect is potent and was saying that the placebo effect may play more of a role than we're gathered from studies
I was all in on Malcolm Mitchell too. I call that a wash since he helped us win a super bowl then died
I was all in on seeing Star Wars the night it came out until I realized it would cost me $25ish after fees at Assembly 
I was already told I wasn't being invited, so I don't have the opportunity to decline
I was also being sarcastic, but I do think it’s completely fair to not know if you want to hike the biggest mountain in New England a month+ out. 
I was also not invited 
I was also on the Yankees in Little League and got booed during the end of the year banquet 
I was also there
I was also underwhelmed. I thought it was a good burger but not worth the time I spent waiting for it 
I was always a bulls fan anyway 
I was always her biggest supporter in the GroupMe 
I was always on Joe’s side but now that I know I will have championships if I support Goody, I support Goody 
I was always part of Donahue's Disciples 
I was anti-Greenland until seeing that price. $200mil for Greenland would be rad.
I was assuming that John's "friend" did not fit the category of someone who lived in an endemic area and therefore should rethink his life decisions if he travels to an area with a high incidence of disease without being prepared
I was astonished 
"I was at a house party on South Street Saturday night that was broken up by the BPD and BCPD. Were they justified in doing this? OF COURSE they were.

Huge numbers of people squished into a third floor apartment was not exactly a safe situation to have gotten myself into. At one point I actually thought the floor of the apartment was going to cave through. So when the police showed up to break up the party, was I complaining? Not really. It had been fun, but it had gotten out of control and the police recognized that."
I was at a wedding all weekend and just got home last night. The hotel had a great Pokemon spawn rate but was no where near a pokestop. 
I was at an interview in which my interviewer was late, didn't read my application, and they forgot to order me lunch. It was still better than watching that game would have been 
I was at that game 
I was at that game. I'm glad I played a factor in stuffing Watt in a locker. 
I was at the game against the Rays where he hit three home runs, including a grand slam on his birthday. That was a fun game 
I was at the game the day after Derek Lowe pitched a no hitter. Does that count for anything?
I was at work last night and didn't get to watch the Thursday night game. The Big Drake Bandit can you explain why the recap is only showing Caleb's stats for the first quarter?
I was available
I was backup point guard for my Melrose rec basketball league
I was being facetious 
I was being sarcastic but ok 
I was born ready 
I was class rep for student government in high school. I could ran for Vice President of A.S.B.
I was close
I was close 
I was completely respectful
I was confused about why it was on cbs last week too 
I was convinced Kovin died when I woke up the next day 
I was convinced you were going to say "maybe you should shut the fuck up"
I was cooking food during that play and only saw the drop. But that's exactly how they should run it every time. They just....don't 
I was correct that I will not beat Marcus
I was disappointed 
I was disappointed to find out that the German girl is now 36 and didn't really appear in many more movies afterwards. 
I was doing 20% of my paycheck for a while when I living at home and spending time at Olivia's apartment. I went down to 10% when I moved in and started paying rent, then 0% when medical school applications came into play
I was driving and listening on the radio, so I don't know what they showed on tv but the radio announcer said he was moving all extremities so at least that's good 
I was driving and missed the end. Assume that they lost 
I was driving to Vermont. I don't check my phone while driving 
I was expecting Nock to want to leave immediately after learning of my impending move. 
I was expecting that the link would bring me to Daredorm 
I was face palming because you confused the twins 
I was fat shaming the tubby individual sitting across from her with a spoon in his hand. I would never speak ill of the wonderful Shelbie 
I was flying home from Texas and didn't land until after midnight. It was a required conference so it's not like I could have bailed a day early. This was all discussed before tickets went on sale 
I was forced to watch the parade for about 6 hours
I was fucking on fleek in middle school 
I was getting a little nervous because for the last few days, the net patients hospitalized for COVID in MA has gone up by double digits. Today that number dropped by 181. There are now 351 admitted patients. At its peak, there were > 3000
I was going for the former 
I was going to advocate for green olives, but after John admitted to never having put olives on a finger as a child, I fundamentally cannot agree with anything that man says
I was going to answer that, but Bocker has it covered 
I was going to answer your question but I think it's better left as is right now 
I was going to ask you what better things you had to do that you couldn't take five minutes to sign the waiver, but now I understand completely. 
I was going to be at a conference on Texas but I'll rearrange my schedule to help your team fundraiser 
I was going to call you a loser for being hype about upsetting URI but then I got to the part about ND and I can now understand your jubilation. Carry on. 
I was going to comment on how many points you left on your bench. Then realized I couldn't really talk.....
I was going to find out if you needed somewhere to stay but nah, fuck me 
I was going to make a joke about it being too late and Chan already fighting his would-be sister to the death but I realized that that's pretty fucked up and might have actually happened so I shouldn't be insensitive enough to talk about it. 
I was going to make the point that if she’s there for a medical mission, I believe she should be more focused on helping people than her social media profile 
I was going to post a gif flipping you off but you changed my mind. Hope you have a great day 
I was going to post a picture of a real human liver but was afraid Joe might throw up 
I was going to post something about Casper and fighting a ghost with another ghost but looks like Joe beat me to it 
I was going to reference lone star taco, but you didn't make a reservation so 
I was going to reply to that, but I think I'm going to keep staying out of this one 
I was going to say "that's why I thanked Kristen and Shelbie individually in the Fuck Bock Boi groupme" and then I realized....
I was going to say Apple sheep to criticize you guys for being dumb and owning Apple products but after discussing how much I love apples, I couldn't do that 
I was going to say fuck you but Marcus made me all depressed so I won't even get any satisfaction from saying it 
I was going to say GHB
I was going to say that I didn’t understand why everyone hated the Snapchat update because it looked exactly the same to me, but then I realized my app hadn’t updated and now I see why the update is shit.....
I was going to say that I don't get how the Jags let Adams get that wide open on the dump off but that's a lie. They're the Jags. I know how they did it 
I was going to say that I hoped your plane crashed but I would never wish that pain on Kristen and Ricky
I was going to say that it was a bad call but to stick with the theme of the past 24 hours, I disagree. Great call. 
I was going to say that it was a fumble but to stick with the theme of the past 24 hours, I disagree. Not s fumble. 
I was going to say that she should be using her time to spend quality time with her mother, but your statement is true too 
I was going to say that we’re going to sign Kaep now, but JBoss already offered his services so I guess Kaep is out of a job again 
I was going to say the same thing, but I was afraid that I skimmed
I was going to say, 100% not a catch 
I was going to say, child rape is a pretty tame subject 
I was going to say, I thought that’s just how he was. He’s been insane for at least a decade 
I was going to say, Joey Brackets did not register for dinner, therefore none of us did 
I was going to say, not if she uses the brand name 
I was going to say, that’s probably one of the worst examples you could pick out. 🔥take, his jokes only land ~20% of the time 
I was going to say, that's fine unless he brings that shit in here. Then he goes and brings that shit in here 
I was going to say...sounds like you're on my side
I was going to suggest the TB12 method, so we could all learn about the TB12 mindset. But Goody's suggestions were better
I was going to text this to Goody, but seeing Bocker get his jimmies riled up last night convinced me to post it here. Gronk cleared. Butler a full participant. Malcolm Brown off the injury report. Wise a full participant at practice. Things looking pretty good health wise 
I was going to type that Fournette should have gone down at the 1. Then I said, only 21 seconds, probably will be fine 
I was going to vote for him but I don't think he has a leg to stand on 
I was going to wish you happy international women's day but you didn't respond and Marcus came in and ruined it. 
I was going with the latter, as I just bought a bunch of cold cuts 
I was going with this one
I was groped, humped, restrained against a wall....and then on a chair 
I was gunna post that but then realized I will never stoop as low as Joe 
I was gunna say, how was that not holding?
I was half joking when I mentioned it earlier, but now I'm 99% sure he's dead in a back alley somewhere in Cleveland after trying to snatch someone's Alakazam
I was half saying it as a joke because they bought it three years ago for about $550k and I am sure it's jumped up since then but if Mercer paid you that kinda money, all the power to you
I was halfway through typing that when you send yours, but I was going to stop 
I was his biggest supporter tonight 
I was hoping for a huge mass that they would have to slice open 
I was hoping for a juicier response
I was hoping he would post an apology to us 
I was hoping Sony would get the call but Tom is a selfish asshole 
I was hoping that becker was wrong about me losing life, so that meant he would be wrong about me losing to Kovin 
I was hoping that you wouldn't notice that 
I was hoping to but unfortunately will not be able to 
I was hoping you would have come to the opposite conclusion 
I was in a group of 5 and thought it was fine. I've never been with a smaller group so I can't speak to that
I was in class until just now but you couldn’t pay me to join in 
I was in eagle EMS. Everything is in the budget. 
I was in New York working, but I was available
I was in the back of Loco with my hand up. Not sure what you're taking about
I was in the IRA once. 
I was in the middle of typing that, but didn't feel like stopping when you guys beat me to it 
I was indifferent to ratio until Joseph voiced his opinion. I want every post to be ratio'd now. Go Darrow!
I was indifferent until becker voiced support for it. Now I'm wholeheartedly against it. #MakeThemPitch
I was invited but I was traveling back from a required conference in Texas 
I was involved in it first car accident on the way home today
I was joking about Marcus having a gambling addiction but now I feel bad for joking because he actually does 
I was joking to trigger Anthony but you are all bad people.
I was just about to comment on how John found his match in a woman: female who is somehow oblivious to the fact that she was exposing herself to the rest of the party
I was just complimenting the Atlanta police chief for engaging protesters outside the department headquarters. Big Yikes for me 
I was just going off the Fox segment. My mistake was 100% influenced by the fake news media
I was just going to say I'm glad I bid $1
I was just going to say that I think lockdowns don't work because of a) those that circumvent them and b) because it's always a middle of the road approach to balance freedoms and safety, so neither really ever win 
I was just going to say that you should tell him to go to an adult hospital 
I was just going to say, replay looks like nothing 
I was just going to say, you make me look good, which was hard to do this week 
I was just making a joke at the expense of our insurance system 
I was just posting that as a way to remind everyone that today is festivus and so everyone would think I'm cool
I was just reading the other day that people want to rename Faneuil Hall because it played some part in the slave trade way back in the day
I was just re-reading about the play and am now reminded that the refs through a penalty flag, then picked it up without explaining why. I am now irate again.
I was just seeing that
I was just so enraged
I was just testing you. You passed. Congrats Joseph. 
I was just thinking the same thing
I was just trying to shit on the NBA 
I was just typing that
I was just watching all of the Mic'd Up from the Super Bowl and thinking about what Van Noy did all through the playoffs. Made me happy to think that we traded him to move from 215th to 239th in the draft
I was kinda curious to see if Jboss would actually make it happen so I threw mine back on
I was like FUCK THAT START TAKING HIS SHIT AS COLLATERAL
I was like number 1 on that, however, I am proud to have removed my like, for the preservation of this GroupMe's integrity
I was limited because I had to pick a company that offered physician loans. TD Bank gave a decent (not amazing, but okay) rate and their customer service was great 
I was literally about to ask if one was a b52. I was too late 
I was literally about to say "Beto? More like beta!" 
I was literally just typing that 
I was literally on my feet pretty much all weekend with the exception of hanging out with Joe, John, and Darrow on Sunday so you can blame them for sabotaging my progress. I would have loved to work out today but physically did not have time in my schedule. That said, I have a nice 3 hour window tomorrow circled on my calendar and plenty of free time Thursday and Friday. Look forward to the check ins from Sackler basement.
I was literally shaking with rage
I was literally thinking today, what happened to @Skimmer. Haven’t heard from him in a minute. 
I was looking for a clever gif but found this instead
I was looking for a picture of you with longer hair but you had too many selfies and I didn't feel like scrolling through all of them 
I was making a Lion King reference in real life and our photographer took a picture of it. Not much else to explain
I was molding the minds of students for the last two hours. Please excuse my tardiness. 
I was more mad at Jeremy. Who isn't going to take the opportunity to piss on a public service vehicle? 
I was more of a "miss the easy layup" kind of guy 
I was more of a fan of Ramon myself 
I was myself but Setara Campbell's mother did not like me 
I was never allowed to eat at Papa Gino's in Melrose growing up because my dad was afraid that the high school dropout that worked there would spit in our food
I was not answering the original question
I was not invited to participate, so all results are invalid 
I was not making in argument in either direction. I was merely stating a fact that hospitalizations in MA increased today
I was not. You were not there 
I was nothing but a saint while organizing dinner last week 
I was on a webinar last night and several of the speakers announced their pronouns as he/they or she/they. I hadn't heard of that before. Maybe I am just an uneducated bigot
I was on the same page as Bocker 
I was once your roommate 
I was only being racist because Jordan was racist first and I wanted him to feel marginalized you 
I was putting away leftovers from dinner in my fridge and my roommate was watching an episode of GoT. It was literally just 10 straight minutes of two chicks talking about boring shit. How do you guys think this show is good?
I was raped by goody at the South St Thanksgiving party 
I was reading a post on r/massachusetts about roast beef sandwiches, which of course made me want one. There is a place in East Providence that does roast beefs on gf buns, so I ordered one for lunch while I am moonlighting. I paid $25 for it through GrubHub. It comes with next to no bbq sauce and whatever sauce it was wasn't James River. Very big disappointment. This is why no one likes Rhode Island (which is essentially just an extension of the South Shore)
I was reading headlines and saw one article that said 25 people were injured. Opened the article and it says that 25 people were injured by tear gas. Fucking put that in the article title 
I was really curious about your opinion on his chipmunk photography technique
I was really just referencing James 
I was really late to the game in trying El Pelon, hence eating chipotle during junior year. But senior year I almost never went to chipotle 
I was reemphasizing your comment
I was referencing John referring to Somerville as "the city"
I was referring to Chan but you do raise a valid point 
I was referring to college. Post college, it was home, Davis square, southie 
I was referring to Joe answering Nick's question 
I was referring to Jordan 
I was replaced
I was saying for weeks that he was just going to show up 
I was saying that it would happen when I already lost the posa 
I was screaming at the TV for the same reason 
I was scrolling back through media to find that picture. Glad Bock Boi has my back 
I was showing my recent catches. Sorry that I was answering Emyr's question
I was simply calling John a skimmer because Goody already reported on the rankings
I was simply pointing out that Emyr and Anthony did this to themselves and I hope they wallow in emotional pain for the duration of the fantasy football season. 
I was simply supporting your freedom to voice your opinion 
I was slightly. But I wasn't surprised 
I was smart enough to have the food brought to me at age 1 
I was so confident in the Celtics that I went to bed at halftime
I was so confident that I wouldn't mess it up 
I was so distraught shit JJ Taylor 
I was so invested in Oregon. Now I know how chan feels 
I was so sure that this was going to be Bill
I was speaking to your twin and goody. And I'm glad I'm not the only one who experiences that 
I was still 51% sure you were going to win before that touchdown 
I was still never told if that was a serious request or not, but whatever 
I was super cereal 
I was supposed to call you at 9 to remind you 
I was talking about him but I guess it applies to both 
I was talking about the bruins during the game last night
I was talking about Zion being Greg Oden 2.0 
I was talking to an attending yesterday who has worked for like 35 years in Emergency Medicine. Both of our badges say Attending Physician but he's definitely senior faculty and I'm junior faculty. He likely gets paid more than me for his base salary
I was telling Bocker, Olivia's friend is matching today and they make everyone come on stage one at a time to open their envelope and announce their pick. Emails go out to everyone who matched in 8 minutes and like a quarter of this class has not opened their envelopes
I was the anchor leg on my high school 4x100m
I was the best at missing fast break layups when I played in the MBA. Too much speed, too much strength 
I was the best defender on my JV high school soccer team. Let that day all you need to know
I was the critical care doctor overnight and had 1 patient get activated all night. 
I was the first one to fill out the doodle, but apparently I didn't enter my name and save it. That's a big L on my part
I was the first time, but goody told me that after I had already enabled sharing. He has to reshare it out to you after you turn it on, which he hadn't done because he's a douchenut
I was the last and only one. Stayed with Olivia's friends 
I was there
I was thinking a little bit for tips for the tour guides and then some cash on hand for emergencies/any cash only places. I was thinking $250-$300 for both Olivia and me so seems like I was in the right ballpark
I was thinking Macedonia, and then we can write some fake news stories to influence the 2018 midterm elections. Just what Marcus wants and supports 
I was thinking more like Jim Cramer's show but instead of listing stocks to buy, he's listing off hot takes 
I was thinking that we get everyone who is below the poverty line and doesn't own an iPhone to fuck every wealthy person in America. That will spread multi-drug resistant STDs around the upper class and allow the working class to move up the social hierarchy. Once in charge, we will continue to oppress the poor and the sick to maintain our dominance 
I was thinking the same thing 
I was thinking the same thing. I might just eat a few loaves of bread and end it if I was in Marcus position 
I was thinking the same thing. I thought it was going to happen in 2022 but Chan got the scoop on the Asian restaurant faster than us I guess 
I was thinking we use emc assets to bet on the celtics. They are obviously point shaving 
I was thinking, you know what would be really sick? If we all wore jerseys from old franchise players and went to the NFL draft to boo whoever our team picks 
I was to hurt to not skim that message...
I was told by two people I interviewed with that they read it
I was told in the first week of MPH classes "if you use the word data as if its singular, you immediately lose all credibility"
I was told that Mike White was a great QB and should have never been allowed to leave the Jets 
I was tortured enough by having you as my friend. 
I was traumatized by Anthony Goodwin as well. We can stand together as survivors, as brothers 
I was trying not to hijack the convo but he was taking too long 
I was trying to 
I was trying to be a Joe shamer but his Ivy League education outsmarted me
I was typing! @Marcus Bauer 
I was under the impression that it was $5 but I think it should be zero now. Can't risk Bocker possibly making money off of me 
"I was under the impression that Joe and Jordan wouldn't be able to make it by a reasonable time on Friday. If they're able to, my vote changes to
Friday "
I was under the impression that the pickem league was 5 rubles 
I was under the impression that this was a "participation trophy" league 
I was under the impression that you remembered the facts I laid out after I "changed the argument" from when we had this same conversation in person
I was under the impression you didn’t have feelings
I was underwhelmed 
I was very clear in my intent to attend and appreciate Bocker’s tireless effort to organize 
I was very slow typing that but decided to continue anyway after goody posted something about #JustFacts✔️
I was violated that night 
I was waiting for Machado to fall off that bag. So close.
I was walking home from the gym and not one, but two cop cars rolled by me extra slowly and stared at me as if they were seeing if I was involved in some sort of crime. Now I know how @Skimmer feels to be profiled 
I was walking out of the ski lodge at Stowe (two days in a row, I'm basically Joe's classmate) while wearing my mask (required inside). Some lady walked by and yelled at me, "don't be a statistic" 
I was way too lazy to actually look up the quote 
I was winning until that Carr fumble. 
I was wondering about that. Good ok becker for calling the dirty skimmer out 
I was wondering if this split was going to happen: Lisa Murkowsky said that she may reconsider her affiliation with GOP if it doesn't distance itself from Trump. It seems like this would be as easy a time as ever for traditional Republicans to disassociate with the MAGA/QAnon politicians. The obvious problem is throwing away potential votes
I was wondering if you were going to back up your promise, Jordan 
I was wondering where whitebread was today. 
I was wondering why the GroupMe was so quiet for two days. My app broke again. 
I was yelling at the TV when Brady dropped back on 3rd and inches. That is why I am not Tom Brady
I was. Thank you. 
I was/am not smart. Literally the only reason 
I wasn’t invited either 
I wasn't :(
I wasn't a basketball fan back then (and am not now)
I wasn't a huge fan of the first two like everyone else seems to be. But I liked this one more. 
I wasn't actually serious. I was referencing your requests from last year's draft. 
I wasn't at the race but I remember now that John came in last 
I wasn't in the field before the ACA was passed, so I can't really speak to what impact it has had. I do know that our clinic staff members and patients are getting requests for coverage denied by their insurance companies at a pretty high rate. From what I gather, the denial rate seems to be increasing and doctors have to jump through more hoops to get patients the care they need, but I can't really comment on how the ACA plays into that 
I wasn't invited to Hawaii for free 
I wasn't invited to this Zoom call
I wasn't looking for an actual answer but I appreciate that you care enough to give one 
I wasn't stupid enough to keep my phone in athletics shorts while working out 
I wasn't sure what the keeper rules were and I couldn't remember if value resets when they are dropped and picked up by a team that didn't draft them. So just in case that was the case, I picked him up. Still haven't looked up what the agreed upon rules were 
I wasn't talking about snacks for you assholes 
I wasn't there while you were talking about it, but Boda Borg in Malden has physical challenges and is sort of like escape the room  
I wasn't there. Story time please.
I wasn't watching. Why did the horse get dq'd
I watch every video in there
I watch Rick and morty 
I watch that video and see that guy captured on national television and think to myself - wow, what an absolute piece of trash. He doesn't deserve a job, a family, happiness. No one will or should love him. He should be forced to whither away in his last years of life alone, banished to battle self-loathing and depression without anyone to turn to for support.
I watch the guy with the "should I open it, or should I keep it sealed" jingle 
I watch the video and feel like she definitely needs to be incapacitated but am wondering if a taser would have been a more appropriate method
I watch Tom Brady and Logan Paul highlights
I watched a reel yesterday that said to divorce your significant other if they didn't know what "the beacons are lit" meant 
I watched all three of them do it but unfortunately Goodell and the media had the records removed from the books 
I watched it 4 times already. What a beginning, middle, and end. They really went for it there. 
I watched it about 17 times on Saturday. Including when I rewatched the entire super bowl
I watched it until it was so uncompetitive, that they changed the local broadcast to Washington-Chicago. 
I watched it years ago, ironically while it was on Netflix, just don't remember her in it 
I watched like 5 flags thrown in a few minute span in the first half 
I watched only like 69 reels on the Eras tour and now my whole feed is Taylor Swift fan girls crying while watching Enchanted live. It's a real burden
I watched season 1 of Lost, then didn't watch any of it until season 5 (or whatever the final season was). Right before episode 1 of the final season dropped, there was a 2 hour recap show that went through the plot of all of the previous seasons. Literally boiled ~100 hours of TV into 2 hours. It was all I needed to jump back in
I watched that video in the groupme and am not disappointed. We need more of her #NockAndJoffVsTheWorld
I watched the first quarter and a bit. Hard core reuniting with everyone I hate from high school. 😐🔫
I watched the video of the coup. The president is confronted by the seditious general, the president tells them to leave, and they do. Coup is over
I weighed myself this morning and had gained a pound so don't hold your breath for tomorrow 
I well-prepared young hiker fell off of them and died and now a bunch of people are calling for more safety measures while a bunch of other people are saying that you can't make nature risk-free 
I went back to look at the few who supported it previously
I went from wanting to murder Becker to celebrating chan's death in a matter of seconds 
I went home and watched the bruins 
I went soft there for a second. Fuck you guys. Especially Ryan 
I went there in high school as an ecotourism trip, so my memory of the names of places is foggy. We started in monteverde, which was beautiful. There is amazing hiking there if you are looking for something active. You can also Zipline over the cloud forest which was probably the coolest thing I have ever done. 
I went through precheck in Charleston, WV at 5 am 
I went to a covered bridge in Stowe. Her parents dragged her out of the house on the guise of running an errand. Her parents pulled over pretending that they saw a moose and they ran out of the car to find me under the covered bridge. 
I went to bed right before GroupMe got lit. I have many regrets. 
I went to Burlington last week and walked right in. Olivia wanted to go to Medford today. This is on her
I went to Costa Rica in high school. I fell asleep on the flight home and woke up to the girl I had a crush on making out with another dude on our trip next to me. Probably my most uncomfortable flight 
I went to Flatbreads in Davis for lunch today and had their gyro special. Lamb, red onions, spinach, feta, Parmesan, mozzarella, tomatoes, finished with a tzichi (spelling?) sauce. Incredible. 
I went to MB once during this lockdown and the staff came out multiple times in the 20 minutes I was in line to apologize for the wait and talk about their 1 in and 1 out policy. The staff at Wegmans never came to tell anyone why they weren't letting people in. Moved up 4 yellow dots (presumably 6 feet apart) in 45 minutes. Line was more than double in size when we left 
I went to the bathroom after Jacksonville scored. Now they have the ball back. What happened 
I went to the first football game of the year with my friend year roommate and his friends, who ended up being chorale friends with Kevin and John. And after the game either Joe texted me or I texted him, we played catch in front of CLXF, and then he brought me along to dinner with the rest of the friend group 
I went to the US in Florida in 2015 and then the one in CA in 2016. The one in Florida was so much more fun. Better rides, more parks, more Harry Potter shit, more restaurants and bars in city walk 
I went to Toro for my 21st birthday, so YMMV
I where a scrub cap for the same purpose
I wholeheartedly abstain from this question 
I wholeheartedly and disrespectfully disagree 
I wholeheartedly disagree that skiing and skating are the same motion. 
I will 
I will "moving" to the edge of the square in June. I use quotations because I already have essentially moved there, but I will officially be on the next lease 
I will abstain due to my severe hatred of watching sports games in bars. Something something Joff is a bitch just like Goody
I will accept that 
I will again reiterate that I don't see issue with the NYT poll and it seems reasonably on par with what I observe in daily life, which the caveat that Bocker mentioned that obviously some portions of the country are better than others. And people need to wear their mask over their fucking noses
I will agree to whatever rules @Skimmer agrees to 
I will agree with that
I will also agree with Joseph that John made it clear he plans to meet up afterwards when he declined to RSVP yesterday 
I will also be flying in roughly 6 hours and hope I do not get the same treatment
I will always be the first to be self deprecating 
I will always do what I can to spread #JustFacts✅
I will announce today, officially, that I will not keep fournette next year 
I will ask about that when I ask about what my salary would be later on 
I will be a homeowner. Exact town TBD, likely not within Burlington 
I will be around, Tony
I will be at a work event tonight 
I will be at neither 
I will be available in 10 minutes 
I will be away the last weekend of August 
I will be doing what I did last year and waiting for the cookie donations to end before I donate because I don't need incentive to help my good friend Prima 
I will be extremely happy if BC wins today but also sad that Joe was right 
I will be going to NYC to visit my good friends Alexander and Thomas and George in February. Likely the only trip I will be able to take
I will be going to warm the house of my good friends, the Powells. I'll get you all invites. Gunna be the sickest party on the block
I will be in DC on 7/21
I will be in Florida
I will be in NYC to see Hamilton with Olivia's whole family. You were going to house us all 
I will be in stowe 
I will be in stowe 
I will be in Vermont, but I appreciate the invite 
I will be in welfare soon. I'll be fine. 
I will be moving back from Springfield and moving to Portland that weekend. Unsure about what free time I will have but keep me involved in your plans 
I will be post overnight Sunday so I will likely be asleep most of the day 
I will be sure to not have that song played at my wedding
I will be sure to post some content about me running around Italy 
I will be there darrow
I will be there in spirit 
I will be wearing a button down with a jacket to hide my immense beer/dessert gut that I have been acquiring over the past 6 months 
I will be working on 9/30 and then will be in Montreal on 9/31 and 10/1 to present a poster 
I will be working until 4pm
I will benefit from this, as will Bocker. You heathens yelling about rape are just as bad as Terry Cruz
I will break my own rule and watch any video/instagram/tweet that disparages Lavar
I will bring buffalo chicken dip and Sprite 
I will bring Catan 
I will change my name back when surgery gives me back the life I know and live
I will charge you a $10 cover but you can still come
I will concede that point. 
I will condemn property destruction and violence when the president condemns violence against blacks
I will continue to fight the good fight
I will defer opinion on the procedure itself to our resident pediatric medical professional
I will disagree with that point to my deathbed 
I will do some weigh ins before the reunion as well. My scale has already been moved to the new place so I will weigh in when I'm there/not regularly 
I will do that after clinic 
I will do whatever@Skimmer  wants to do
I will explain it anyway. You essentially take out the back bone to spread the turkey into a butterfly shape and then cook the turkey "flat" instead of as the whole bird 
I will explain what I know. It is in Seattle. It stands for Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The protesters section off a part of the neighborhood with barricades and the police have had to shut down a police precinct in the area. Each entrance/exit has guards to prevent police from coming in and out. Some news outlets have reported that the guards are open-carrying, others have reported that they are concealed carrying, and others still have reported that no one is armed. The assistant police chief for Seattle has accused the protest group of extorting businesses in the area for permission to stay open. The protesters deny that that's true. I've seen a lot of pictures from protesters of groups of people listening to speeches and documentaries about race in America.
I will face fuck your team into its grave joe. 
I will gather, but definitely will not be merry if Marcus is there
I will gladly convert to another medium of communication with my support system 
I will happily allow that to receive 12 likes. It deserves it 
I will have to shop at trader Joe's more then. Good to know 
I will join in the evening, as I am at an emt recert class in Quincy until 7 on 12/3
I will just be getting out of work as the game is starting so I am probably going to stay close to Melrose to watch it so I don't miss any of it 
I will keep my eyes out for Nan. I have no doubt that she has no recollection of who I am 
I will leave this fucking mountain right now to defend my girl 
I will let you know when I listen 
I will likely be in VT that weekend 
I will likely not be there for the immediate tasting and judging, my hope is to get there around 5ish if that's still okay
I will literally be at HotC from 7 am to 7 pm
I will literally play this exact clip every time someone says this to me 
I will look through some places tonight and send to you goody 
I will love every one of them 
I will make less than that until he's out of office (unless he gets two terms), so that doesn't bother me 
I will make them next time you're in town
I will murder you 
I will never allow this trade to stand 
I will never endorse Clowney. 
I will never give you my buff chix dip or it's recipe, Anthony. 
I will never like a comment by @The Big Dick Bandit ever again 
I will never make a Facebook album again 
I will never not have proof of you saying that the mbta sucks 
I will never read anything Joe posts 
I will never rely on@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  again
I will never trust those fake text message conversations. Jordan 🐐
I will never understand the struggle that your family went through. And I am 100% certain that they have had to deal with the effects of racism their whole lives. But the data are clear that black communities are underfunded, underhoused, and overpoliced. When the war on drugs happened, it was black and latino populations that were targeted and arrested. Those who were jailed lost all access to the same education and economic opportunities as other populations. That pits them in a cycle of further wealth disparities and with fewer access to higher education and jobs, while their communities continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of funding and overpolicing.
I will not @ you 
I will not answer your question out of protest of you liking Chan's comment
I will not be at the rehearsal dinner 
I will not be getting an AirBnB
I will not be going on Sunday, though, as I will be spending quality time with my family on Easter, which is a holiday of a religion that I definitely devoutly follow 
I will not be going to Foxwoods and will be drafting from my apartment. All are welcome, as previously mentioned 
I will not be going to tailgate today. I know goody is the only one here who truly understands what it takes to be an athlete, but for the rest of you plebes, I have to recover and get some treatment today 
I will not be joining. I have a date 
I will not be ordering cookies 
I will not be participating. I already pay for a gym membership and am pinching pennies right now 
I will not be posting a thank you in the other groupme 
I will not be serving mint juleps because I strickly only celebrate holidays if they encourage cultural appropriation. Fuck the derby 
I will not be taking questions 
I will not be there as things stand currently
I will not be there. And it is 0% infected, the wounds are just still scarring over from where they cut into me
I will not be traveling into and out of the city this evening when it's snowing. That sounds miserable. Although I love me some pelon 
I will not do that
I will not do that 
I will not do that 
I will not do that. 
I will not edit it so everyone sees my typo 
I will not out of principle
I will not participate mostly because I don't want to make any of you happy for even 2 seconds
I will not spoil the series if you take all of Bocker's draft dollars and give them to me 
I will not watch a video in the groupme
I will now go back to ignoring you for 4.5 hours. Hope you all have a terrible day! 
I will once again state for the record that I will not take the SATs if I come in last.
I will only eat buffalo chicken dip on SB day
I will only support you as commissioner, Chan, if you promise to put Aaron Rodgers and Rob Gronkowski on my team, where they deserve to be
I will personally donate $4 to his cause to see that company happen 
I will politely decline 
I will refuse to answer a chirp from the dick pic sender 
I will repay you in beer or a gift card to the restaurant of your choosing 
I will report back on the 10s
I will request that the court ignore the previous comment by Mr. Goodwin, as he already stated that he rests his case. 
I will root for any scenario where Morcus loses and Joseph wins
I will stand to protect the FH shield to death 
I will starve if I just to maintain my lifestyle 
I will still beat kovin tonight. I am not scared 
I will support Chan's effort to belittle and/or face punch that individual 
I will take that as a no 
I will test him against his will. 
I will trade all $200 of my draft dollars to whoever has Brady. He will get his suspension overturned and if he doesn't throw for 5 td's, 0 interceptions, and 600 yards a game I will be shocked 
I will try and get pictures but we're at a crowded bar with my brother's fiance's family. I'll do my best 
I will underspend @Nick D, I guarantee it 
I will unfortunately be at work
I will VPN in at night or weekends if my bosses need something urgently and I am able to, but I am paid hourly so the next day when I'm in work, I just submit those hours retroactively and get reimbursed 
I will, of course, reserve judgement until my opinions are shaped by The Heroes.
I WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
I win. Everyone needs to pay me $1000
I wish 
I wish $0.04 was 400% of my net worth
I wish @Skimmer  would finally tell me if "Us" was the black-people version of "Up"
I wish @Zo and @joffbot were here to enjoy this
I wish all the idiots would just let Kamala Harris and Seth Moulton duke it out for the democratic nomination and then pair up with the loser for the best ticket in presidential history
I wish Bock Boi was here to talk about this issue with me
I wish Chris Sale didn't die
I wish college football was never discussed in this GroupMe, too
I wish DPI was just a 15 yard penalty and defensive holding was not an automatic first down 
I wish everyone would leave my friend chan alone 
I wish he was here with us to celebrate 
I wish her nothing but the best 
I wish I could claim that account as mine
I wish I could have started AP instead of Big Ben who is bound to get -14 points today 
I wish I could like that 12 times
I wish I could like that chirp more than once
I wish I got invited to other one year old birthday parties
I wish I had $100 to spend to buy a jersey of a player on a team I don't like to hope that he gets hurt
I wish I had a collection of tswift gifs, but I have a very small collection of photos/gifs on my phone 
I wish I had more than four of Bocker's bitmojis 
I wish I had the money to afford to pay full price for all of those. Admittedly, id probably rather spend it on blackjack and hookers
I wish I had the same quality spawns as you do Emyr 
I wish I knew what day it was today 
I wish I lived for anything like Morcus lives for capitalizing on Cuomo's bad press
I wish I was watching with my good friends Bock Boi, Krosten, Rocky, and Fronk
I wish my job was fully remote 
I wish my unemployment was as fun as John's unemployment 
I wish people making this argument could stand in my ER and watch the Covid patients roll in. I took care of six Covid positive patients last night. The only one who got admitted was an unvaccinated 32 year old. 
I wish people realized that no one gives a shit about any political message that gets posted on Facebook 
I wish society just paid people what they deserve to make based on the service they provide and not rely on the consumer's opinion on the employees performance to determine how much money they make 
I wish someone else was going from working nights back to days and was having insomnia while moonlighting with me 
I wish someone would pay for my silence 
I wish someone would set up a trivia night like they promised
I wish someone would tell draft-eligible college football players that if they have a choice between beating their girlfriend or not beating their girlfriend, they should probably choose the latter 
I wish the app let us make separate topics 
I wish the GroupMe was lit
I wish the members and leadership of OUR league had more than an ounce of integrity
I wish the Patriots would bring back the best QB in franchise history 
I wish the Red Sox had a pitcher like Andrew Miller 
I wish they told us that at the two hour benefits meeting they made us sit through...
I wish to have a redo on the games today 
I wish we could stay healthy like we did last year 
I wish we didn’t let Tony Lovullo or however you spell his name leave 
I wish you avenged me
I wish you both the best of luck in your endeavors to get a free lunch 
I wish you could favorite a meme to save it for later. I love this 
I wish you nothing but happiness and success today and all days, Jordanzer
I wish your future guests were more considerate
I wish, as a pats fan, I could feel more confident in our future with Gronk. 
I wish. 
I wish. Does the video not work? 
I wish. I miss shitty Chinese food 
I wish. I would love to share a bottle of chianti classico with that specimen of a human 
I woke up early because I am in clinic today 
I woke up to the most majestic dog cuddling into me and staring into my eyes. Olivia was there too. Went on a long walk through the woods. Came home. Took a cooking class with Jet Tila. Now in food coma. Will shortly get ready for cocktail class 
I won a $10 gift card to tasca again. Up for grabs if anyone wants it. Expires on the last day of the month 
I WON A GAME I WON A GAME!
I won Catan. I am the best fuckhoke 
I won outright 
I won the draft and you're all bad
I won the posa, therefore I am a champion and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise
I WON THE SURVIVOR POOL
I won’t give in to peer pressure 
I won’t reciprocate if you continue to talk about basketball 
I wonder how boaty mcboatface 
I wonder how Bocker is taking the news 
I wonder how long it would take BB to enter my soul with a death stare if I asked him that
I wonder how many people died over a PS5 this year
I wonder how many times Bocker made his friends change the date and time of their golf outing to fit his schedule
I wonder how much Marcus paid for that Fox Nation ad 
I wonder how much of it is due to watching AJ Brown torch them last week
I wonder how much sowingsowing
I wonder if he gets royalties for all of the left shark costumes that got made 
I wonder if he's available to handle manage fantasy football teams 
I wonder if Shelbie would have married him if she knew this is what Marcus would become 
I wonder if Syria and Iraq have Pokemon Go 
I wonder if the Andrew Beck on the Broncos is the same Andy Beck who is a recent graduate of the Brown EM program and current attending physician at Rhode island and The Miriam hospitals
I wonder if they drug test skateboarders like they do track and swimming athletes 
I wonder if we ended up living with Stephen Wu instead of Jordan, if he would have stolen my Fruity Pebbles
I wonder what things we do today will cause us to be cast aside by society in 200 years
I wonder what would happen if I went to jail. Technically, Celiac is covered by the ADA, but would a prison actually abide by that without legal action? 
I wonder why Richard Sherman is triggered 
I won't argue that the primary focus is on police brutality against blacks. But movements like defund the police and 8 can't wait are initiatives to reform the police for everyone's benefit, not just black people. And those are widely supported by the BLM movement 
I won't be 
I won't be able to do that
I won't be drafting a 3-4 linebacker if I run a 4-3 system 
I won't be surprised when that number doubles for to massive inefficiencies
I won't be sweating it out. I have more important things to do than to watch my team murder Breadcrumbs 
I won't be there, but can you add me to the res and change the time and date of the dinner?
I won't comment on beating Jordan this week until the Monday night game is over. Bell might lose 10 fumbles 
I won't divulge my sources 
I won't do it for a penny less than $345k
I won't do that, but I think becker would 
I won't make it chan. Thanks for the invite though. I hope Anna's is good to you 
I won't rage quit the GroupMe though 
I won't say it
I won't see you Tuesday night. So no 
I won't trust anything until a different president gets inducted in January 2021
I won't watch videos in the GroupMe
I wore than 50% of the day. Didn't have them at the first park of the day
I work during the holidays 
I work Friday until 730 pm so likely will miss dinner that night and I have a preexisting residency commitment on Sunday that will preclude me from further activities 
I work in the same hospital as my wife 
I work the next 5 days then work Christmas. The bots should too
I worked all night and still brought my dog to daycare this morning. The grind is real
I worked evening last night but start back on nights tonight 
I worked from 7am-4pm and now working from 730pm-730am. Gutta get that money for Casa Playa 
I worked out for second day in a row. I should be back to 150lbs now right? 
I worked until 2 am last night. Wrapped up and left at 230. Roads were all snowy so didn't get home till 3am. Took a shower, had something to eat, caught up on GroupMe and went to bed. Pretty straight forward
I worked until midnight last night 
I worry about whether Josh Gordon will be paying, yes @#JustFacts✅ 
I would 100% rather support local small businesses. Amazon is just so damn convenient 
I would absolutely pick degens over delays 
I would add balsamic to my ice cream
I would add that DO schools have a part of the curriculum where they brainwash students into already propaganda about how good DO schools are. This has a dual effect of recruiting more applicants to DO schools while convincing DO students that they aren't inferior 
I would agree if I weren't a ners fan for life 
I would also HATE BOB coming to BC. The man has zero loyalty to college football and would jump at the opportunity to get another HC gig in the NFL 
I would also like a new Sonos speaker 
I would also like an apology for being out of egg whites to make my cocktail 
I would also like Gunner and Bailey to be paid handsomely, even though neither are up for new contracts 
I would also murder for 16 points per game
I would appreciate if you made up with Bocker
I would argue against Carr sucking, but he doesn’t deserve what he’s getting. Maybe $15mil a year 
I would argue that doing nothing to support LGBTQ+ rights in the face of overt homophobia makes you a smaller man 
I would argue that Hitler was very good at his job when he came to power...
I would argue that no one in the Fuckhole demographic would label themselves as "treasurer of Keg City Club"
I would argue that some Catholics also deserve the label of convicts 
I would argue that spending time with the Fuckholes is fun, regardless of the venue and situation and if you think otherwise, you can git out 
I would argue that the biggest factor is actually having a credit card. Can't pay back what you don't spend 
I would assume so but I'm not really sure. I know both draft kings and fanduel have headquarters in New York, but the AG seems to be fine with them continuing to work from those locations 
I would bathe in that 
I would be able to eat there, according to the interwebs
I would be absolutely indifferent to him winning, but knowing how much happiness it would bring members of this GroupMe, I am very happy to root for him to lose
I would be at a low stakes blackjack table with you all night if I wasn't working 
I would be but I cannot
I would be dead if I got hit with that
I would be down for that
I would be down to watch this happen regardless of the bowl game
I would be happy if Bill focuses on coaching and divorces himself from managing contracts and drafting 
I would be honored to be #1 on that list
I would be interested
I would be interested 
I would be interested in the 24th if everyone else can do that day 
I would be interested, depending on cost, as I don't get any Red Sox games now that my slingbox doesn't work (thanks Comcast)
I would be more concerned about conditioning of athletes competing at higher altitude 
I would be much happier if I did not have to hear about him talk about golf or Goody talk about the NBA
I would be okay with a 7pm start IF it was the only game but then everyone on the west coast is gunna complain about games starting at 4pm on a Monday
I would be open to expand the policy to cover all track medals 
I would be so ashamed of myself 
I would be soft too if my city had the fucking mummers parade 
I would be willing to bet (metaphorically) that in creating a separate, cheaper "no bells and whistles" ticket, that the price of a standard ticket went up
I would be. Hard for someone that tall to be explosive enough out of a start 
I would bet that happens on ~50% of plays. There wasn’t much contact. 
I would book it annually for the next five years
I would bring honor to the posa by gracing it with my team 
I would burgle the shit out of your apartment for your glasses
I would but cannot. Big exam tomorrow
I would but I have a bad week next week, need to study 
I would but I'm unfortunately out of the state that weekend for a wedding. Blame Olivia 
I would but you came to Boston last night without telling anyone.
I would buy a nuke 
I would buy Becker's private jet from him 
I would call it vastly different from Whole Foods.
I would care about Becker's book if he didn't bet for the patriots (which was actually him betting against the patriots)
I would choose nic cage. People would see the movie just to see what weird shit he would do 
I would choose to spend the 7 days in Italy in a Tuscan villa
I would cite Purdue Pharma as an example of what happens when companies advertise dangerous drugs directly to consumers and physicians. You end up with the opioid epidemic and costing billions of dollars to the healhcare system annually 
I would come but I’m hosting a party this weekend. Coincidently also on Saturday night 
I would consider myself a hypocrite if I supported this trade 
I would consider them texting you the ticket to get into the event would be considered necessary 
I would count your towels, Goody. You might be a few short 
I would cut newton if I were you Ryan 
I would disagree with that travel call had I been watching 
I would disappoint her so hard. 
I would dispute your use of "dominated." Last poll I saw was ~6 point difference in a district that Tom Price won by like 20 something points. I would call it a deflating loss for Dems, given how much money and time was spent on this election, but I wouldn't say Ossoff was dominated 
I would dive head first into the gulag before I sent any FH there, except Joe and Morcus
I would do it after he retires just to say fuck you to the NFL 
I would do it but I'm too irate 
I would do it but I'm very busy and enjoy allowing the less talented members of the GroupMe get some practice 
I would do that
I would do the same list as your first (which has a typo) but replace Manning with Brady
I would drive an hour to hang out with you
I would eat El Pelon 99 times out of 100 over chipotle 
I would eat the fuck out of a peking duck if anyone did it gf
I would echo that I absolutely don't have a solution, but it seems kind of crazy to me that a guy who had twice been interviewed by the FBI for having ISIS ties was able to legally purchase a handgun and a long gun 
I would expect that those mistakes would not have been made 
I would fake a field goal and try to throw it to an OT
I would favor Kasich over any other republican candidate because he said "women left the kitchen to come vote" for him. Instant winner 
I would feel that way being 20 minutes away from Joe too 
I would give 2 firsts for Watson. Who says no? Least Caserio can do for us
I would give that man the nuclear codes
I would gladly attempt to remake such a monumental display of artistic excellence as my punishment 
I would gloat so much about the T being shit if 11 people didn't get hurt 
I would go back in a heart beat
I would go to a chiropractor but only because having someone who can professionally crack all my joints is pretty dope. I can guarantee it wouldn't help anything, but i am a crack addict 
I would go to California if I was selling gluten free products. I'd have a sweet vacation and be rich in a matter of hours 
I would go to war (figuratively) for a man like this any day of the week and 4 times on Sunday
I would go to your boss and tell him that she's sexually harassing you. That always work 
I would happily play sports, but you guys stopped inviting me to play on your teams starting in sophomore year 
I would have also guessed that due to the combo of Common and Lil Dicky
I would have answered 
I would have applied to Washington and Stanford and tried to make them back to back 
I would have because I’m not a doubter/hater
I would have been happy with holt
I would have been tempted too
I would have bet my life on the fact that Kristen makes you watch those shows 
I would have bet that was going to be a pick 
I would have come had it had choices within my dietary restrictions. Im glad y’all had a good time 
I would have disagreed
I would have gladly donated my semen to such a noble cause 
I would have gladly fed you pink gala among the orchard
I would have gone for it but not with that run call and not with Rex 
I would have if he invited us to his NBA finals/GoT watching party 
I would have loved to have been there and not stuck in a plane on a tarmac for five hours, but we don't all get what we want 
I would have more separation than the two parts of my hair 
I would have more space than the braincell in Bocker's head 
I would have never gotten that 
I would have never let that happen 
I would have normally taken the deal but I can’t take a receiver going against the Pats this week 
I would have put my name in for Jeff vs himself 
I would have racked my brain trying to figure it out and probably would have ended up giving you a pity chuckle 
I would have rather they have recruited the sausage guy or that dude who stands on the bridge over the mass pike handing out information about Jesus before every game 
I would have skimmed Joe's post because it was a college football video. I would not have realized that an illness had befallen Michael. 
I would have taken your wife's spot in the reservation but I wasn't invited to do so 
I would have texted you
I would have thought with the coaching switch, he'd be sure to leave 
I would have to go see a doctor for that. That seems like a terrible idea. 
I would have wanted nothing more than to go hang out with Jack at an orchard. 
I would have way more confidence if the military handled it than the current system 
I would have zero confidence in Joe to describe the taste of any adult beverage other than bud light
I would help if I could, but I don't know the answer to that either 
I would hope that the military intelligence officer doesn't share his location with you 
I would hope that they would have converted to a real team like BC, which is affiliated with the Catholic Church 
I would hope West Virginia would have the cleanest drinking water in the state of West Virginia YES I KEPT TYPING 
I would if I could but I can't so I won't 
I would if I didn't need to actually pay attention 
I would if I wasn't going to see it in New York
I would implore you to check your monthly statement and look for fees. Otherwise I can't explain why I get charged and you don't 
I would indulge but would immediately regret it after 
I would invest more, but I’m concerned that Darrow stealing Bocker’s girl will complicate the business model 
I would jump on that so fast
I would just hide my paper towels and toilet paper under my bed if you tried to use them 
I would just like to say that only Goody cheats at trivia.
I would just retire and exile myself to a third world country like Italy for not drafting him myself
I would kill myself before I fought Emyr 
I would kill to be team body
I would label those seasons as emphatic failures, not mediocrities
I would last probably 60 seconds 
I would laugh if they promoted Daddy Callahan to interim HC
I would like @Boe Jourque to share his opinion on what happened
I would like @JustFacts✅ to share a picture of @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim's callous with the GroupMe. 
I would like a detailed analysis of the full album, Bocker.
I would like Darrow to be added twice
I would like Joff to motivate Joff
I would like to announce that I'm currently at Fox & The Knife
I would like to announce that our Lions franchise has won six straight superbowls, going 19-0 each year 
I would like to be that cat 
I would like to dispute the keeper value for Carlos Hyde. I picked him up for $1. 
I would like to get together for the game this weekend 
I would like to have Jimmy G back as Tom Brady’s backup for the next 5 years (before Brady retires) on a minimum contract. Who says no? 
I would like to join but am apparently not invited. Both because a using menu would kill me and because bocker doesn't want to invite me to a restaurant
I would like to learn things
I would like to meet this Alexis Ren individual though 
I would like to motion to remove goody's 🐐 adding powers. He's clearly making a mockery of the system that Mr. Bourque so generously set up and maintains. 
I would like to officially proclaim that the GroupMe was not lit today 
I would like to revise it a second time then 
I would like to see the phins win if it means the Steelers lose
I would like to state for the record that I have clinched the playoffs in my two other leagues. I would also like to state that none of that matters because I won't make the playoffs in the Fuckholes
I would like to state that I would never boycott @Skimmer 
I would like to, however, compliment Bocker on his fair and unbiased criticism of his life partner 
I would literally never choose Kelly's over Billy's for roast beef. And their fried seafood is just meh 
I would live in Wegman's if I had the option
I would look forward to going to work if I got paid a six digit salary 
I would love Becker to win by .04, only to have his win taken away by stat correction 
I would love if they didn't 
I would love Joe Kelly if he wasn't a Dodger bitch
I would love OBJ. Thanks for the offer kind, sir. 
I would love to be sitting next to Becker watching this game and seeing his heart just shatter 
I would love to but am unfortunately working
I would love to but am unfortunately working today 
I would love to get Matty E fired today 
I would love to hear your scenario 
I would love to know what metric Bocker is using to determine me to be a poor
I would love to see all the hate and negativity dissipate away and have us all be supportive friends who don't wish to fight each other
I would make a great Secretary of Defense 
I would make a joke about FSU girls being more attracted to meth labs and crab legs but I couldn't disparage GPonyta like that 
I would make it harder for people to see golf and not feel bad one bit 
I would make that trade 
I would make the bitmoji of Marcus accepting the L but I'm going to the gym and thus cannot 
I would much rather choose other types of food if I were eating out: Asian, Mexican, American, etc. Would prefer to make Italian food at home with my own family recipes and ingredients. My opinion may be skewed by the gluten free thing, but I'd rather eat other foods when I go out 
I would much rather go to market basket
I would murder for 11+ per game
I would name and shame the airline but that would be interpreted as unpatriotic 
I would never
I would never
I would never 
I would never argue that WMC is the best place around, but I definitely think it is in the "very good" category
I would never ask Joe for a reference for anything 
I would never be an asshole like that and purposefully screw you over 
I would never consent to being the titular character of that film because I hate super hero movies
I would never ditch my friend @〽️ichigan 〽️an during a fake golf outing 
I would never do anything to "own" or adopt Dr. DiBlasi. He is a far superior human, friend, and Fuckhole. I respect his dedication to making and standing by incorrect statements.
I would never do such a thing 
I would never dunk on my great friend Morcus
I would never fight @emyrbot
I would never fight my good friend Chan. 
I would never give a tip to a Foxtrot's wife
I would never harm a dog and do not condone Chan's dietary habits 
I would never hate Matt Ryan. Luckily I won't have to worry about that when the Pats win 
I would never ignore my good friend Bocker
I would never let you down 
I would never murder Marcus. I would absolutely murder that no-good Morcus 
I would never reply to that chat
I would never say anything bad about Chan. He was always my friend since the first football game after graduation 
I would never say anything mean about you 
I would never share classified documents. I'm not in the air national guard
I would never skim 
I would never skim 
I would never skim anything you wrote 
I would never steal from a great company headquartered in Boston, like GE. I would, however, steal from Chicago public schools. 
I would never try to bring you down on social media
I would never try to Dress for Less from Walmart 
I would never violate hipaa
I would never want a coach that prevents NFL star Hunter Long from blossoming 
I would never want to be associated with Becker. 
I would never want to raise your child
I would never watch a second of the big bang theory 
I would normally agree with Goody's pick 100%, but he's dead to me. Would rather face the Steelers. 
I would not be surprised if 4-5 states were in lockdown before the end of the weekend
I would not be surprised if Belichick has a supply closet of replacement knees for each player
I would not be surprised if Jordan had an emotional break on the AT and now has come back to Massachusetts to slowly kill the Fuckholes one by one. Soon the whole groupme picture will be blacked out except for Jordan
I would not be upset if Marky Mark ended up buried in cement in the big dig 2.0
I would not call her attractive personally
I would not call him a racist either. I would call him ignorant to the prevalence of racism in our society, especially within the microcosm of the NFL which is historically black players being controlled by white owners
I would not call them line cutting. I would call them: passage to an alternative line that just happens to be shorter
I would not describe that as beating the shit out of him. I mean, if I watched the video, which I didn't, because I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
I would not disrespect Jordan like that
I would not enjoy either of those options 
I would not enjoy either of those options 
I would not enjoy living in NYC
I would not like to fuck a trout
I would not like to see JJ Watt get naked 
I would not make fun of you for punching people 
I would not wish to burden Kristen with my dietary limitations
I would not yell at you. The Big Drake Bandit would not yell at you 
I would only judge you because of your goal to be a stay at home dad. You have to have seen it at least 15 times to qualify for stay at home privileges 
I would pause the league for 1 month. Move everyone to a secret football compound in the middle of one of the Dakotas (location not specified for integrity of the league). The compound is named Area 51 Yard Line. I then restart the season from the beginning with a bubble. 
I would pay $15 to not have any of them 
I would pay $54 to keep him. Which means it's probably not worth it 
I would permit her access to my genitalia if requested. 
I would point out that probably every hospital is having staffing challenges that lead to significant safety concerns. It's not like you can wave a magic want and double your staff nurses, open up more beds, and eliminate boarding/long wait times/delays for testing and treatment 
I would prefer if only Darrow wrote power rankings 
I would prefer if Sam Bradford could get the cock out of his mouth and throw to Kyle Rudolf. 
I would prefer neither, personally. But there is nothing wrong with encouraging healthy competition that hopefully ends up with you and joe fighting to the death 
I would prefer oar
I would prefer that over you endorsing me
I would prefer that people not be sterilized against their will and instead we increase education and access to affordable birth control methods 
I would prefer that we have a government run by non-idiots 
I would prefer you didn't
I would put Hakeem in between you and Marcus. I don't think Marcus has earned #3
I would rather an overpay than the alternative, which is not paying anyone which is what they usually do 
I would rather be handcuffed to a chair in a dungeon while being forced to watch the last quarter of super bowl 42 (which didn't happen, btw) on repeat with my eyes taped open
I would rather be on Schindler's list than your list 
I would rather be vacationing in Hawaii while telling everyone that I was studying for engineering finals
I would rather fire the AD than BoB if the relationship is that bad
I would rather have Tyreek for $38 than Adams for $27
I would rather not be associated
I would rather see the point totals drop to 5 points and 3 points for w/r/t and qb respectively, but I would not support the change if you didn't make interceptions worth 1.5
I would rather spend time with Joe talking about the geopolitical climate of Catalonia than watch a superhero movie 
I would rather tell you 
I would rather watch a Cardinals/Bills Sunday night game than any matchup involving the Cowboys 
I would rather watch dolphins jags
I would rather watch politics
I would rather you get blown up too 
I would really rather not wait and reduce the amount of time I have to spend with you, but I suppose I will wait 
I would recommend not choosing that gym then 
I would recommend reading every post from this morning 
I would run through walls for BB too
I would sacrifice my family for 9 wins in fantasy. 
I would say it ranks like 3/10 on the spiciness scale. It is a delicious addition to many dishes for the fact that it adds some spiciness without overpowering your palette 
I would say something about your inability to be your own genetic individual but I already talked shit about that to your genetic equal. Don't want to overuse the same jokes 
I would say thank you, but since this is the Fuckholes, I can't shake the feeling that Becker is trying to lure us into a trap somehow 
I would say that bad Reese's are faaaaar more common than a nice, crisp, fresh Reese's
I would say that Bocker's class has more insufferable tryhards than mine does. We have a handful of them, but they are easy enough to avoid 
I would say that I stand corrected but go fuck yourself 
I would say that Paramore is more influential to music than The Beatles 
I would score more PKs, for sure 
I would still find Jaguars vs buccs on Thursday night to be more exciting 
I would still not hate Nikki Elliot
I would suggest running a paired T test as the statistical calculation in this situation
I would support a six team playoff. Conference champs get a better look and one loss teams and non-P5 teams get a chance to make it in. 1st and 2nd ranked teams get a bye week 
I would support my good friend bocker in commandeering Kristen's dad's bed 
I would support you if you were gay but I don't support you for being you 
I would tag Goody but he screwed up the league scoring
I would take the $70 hit
I would text him but I can't imagine that he has service
I would think he should be on on every play, but even God needs a day of rest 
I would think it was a dumb game too if I couldn't get purple first today
I would think that maybe you would want to prepare for the interviews that only determine where you spend the next 3-7 years of your life
I would think they would move Election Day to August specifically to resolve this issue 
I would think you would like having old dudes with masks stick things in your mouth, Bocker 
I would too. Just let me know when you do so I can short GE stock 
I would trade a 3rd for Herb and draft MHJ
I would trust a cake made by Ryan over your cake 
I would trust darrow on that 
I would trust Goody's assessment of what's considered a cuck. He's the king of getting cuckholded (cuckheld?)
I would understand and trust Bill if Butler wasn’t practicing in the top packages all week. I can’t think of a valid reason why he would be benched right before the game when the team had spent all week practicing a specific way 
I would want nothing more
I would watch a week 5 Pats-Jets 1 pm game over any CFB rivalry 
I would watch the shit out of that but I just canceled by ELVNHD subscription last week
I would wear this sticker 
I would write the best recommendation 
I would, but it got me to Davis and back home without a problem. Plus, it's not there fault that a brand new condo building turned into a six alarm fire right across the street 
I woulda gone for 2 there.
I woulda gone for it 
I woulda left Kelly in
I wouldn’t be a true fuckhole if I just rolled over and let you chirp me 
I wouldn’t be opposed to sacrificing that family to the North Koreans
I wouldn’t be surprised if John rubs in those toe shoes 
I wouldn’t consider debunked by reddit as any more or less reputable than a source on Twitter 
I wouldn’t expect a small baller with a small brain like joe to understand the joke 
I wouldn’t pay a cent to espn. 
I wouldn’t wear my white coat while studying either.....
I wouldn't be able to make anything during the day on either Saturday or Sunday
I wouldn't be caught dead 
I wouldn't be surprised if all those players score 15 touchdowns each this season. And that's not even counting Henry's 20 and the MVP season of Jonnu Smith
I wouldn't be surprised if Joe broke the bots every month to take away their posts. He's ashamed of what he's become in the GroupMe
I wouldn't be surprised if John Lynch has Jimmy G traded by halftime 
I wouldn't be surprised if stork has practiced some. 
I wouldn't be surprised if we signed all the key ones. I would be equally unsurprised if we lose them all. I see us keeping Long, Floyd, Branch, Develin. Patscap thinks Hightower will be tagged. I'm thinking we lose Bennett, Harmon, and Ryan. I think we let Sheard, Mingo, Bolden, Blount go. Vollmer retires.
I wouldn't call owning a studio in Somerville as being a "real estate mogul"
I wouldn't consider Joe to be a bandwagon fan. He certainly watched more regular season than I did. I will be the first to admit that I bandwagon the bruins. Not because I don't care about them, but because I prefer to invest my time in other sports 
I wouldn't consider my current job "my career" for reasons previously stated, but will answer the question anyway. My clinical study is very patient-family centered, relies heavily evidence-based practices, contributes to research in the field, and supports a multidisciplinary care model. All of those are aspects that I hope my future career has 
I wouldn't dare 
I wouldn't expect you to waste leftover food
I wouldn't give her shit
I wouldn't hate that 
I wouldn't have disappointed you if you didn't have unreasonable expectations. 
I wouldn't have the pleasure of knowing
I wouldn't have understood the reference 
I wouldn't know, I only read the first 2/3rss
I wouldn't let Bailey on the plane home today. Leave him in London 
I wouldn't make that trade 
I wouldn't put all my eggs in the preventative care basket. There are other areas where care can be optimized to reduce spending, such as during the last year of life 
I wouldn't respect you if you responded in any other way 
I wouldn't say that that was lip syncing. She had the track on with her vocals in the background. In some parts, she clearly was singing over it, in other parts she just wasn't singing at all. She wasn't pretending to sing to fool everyone in e 
I wouldn't show your face around here anymore
I wouldn't stop complaining.
I wouldn't take CMC unless the Panthers agreed to pay his entire contract and all we had to give up was a 7th rounder 
I wouldn't think too much about it, Emyr. Ryan is more Asian than Jordan and Chan combined, and therefore l33t at most video games 
I wouldn't trust a Bocker surprise. The last surprise he left me involved a set of genitalia, an electrical socket, a jar of mayonnaise, a group of middle eastern school children, and two prairie voles 
I wouldn't trust any of you fuckholes to keep score
I wouldn't trust Becker to keep score
I wouldn't, I was just trying to tease out goody's statement 
I wouldn't. Just saying theoretically and trying to guess at what Goody was getting at
I wrote the caption of this post specifically to piss off Bocker and he has not commented on it yet. Truly disappointing 
I*
I, 100%, without a doubt, could definitely pick Freddie Freeman out of a crowd 
I, for one, am always a fan of teams that are stacked with talent losing. So independent of Tom Brady, I am very happy when the Buccs lose.
I, for one, am rooting for us to win 
I, for one, chose to ignore Frankie's message because he's a Fuckhole and I honestly can't tell at this point if he really got Covid or not 
I, for one, denounce rape in all of its forms 
I, for one, supported GroupMe from day one 
I, for one, would not want you to kill yourself, Jordan. 
I, however, did not give him that benefit when deciding who to start in my lineup 
I, however, have never once complained about either
I, Joff Savarino, have been invited to ask Dr. Fauci a question live during a zoom lecture that he is giving to the Tufts community on Monday. 
I, like Becker, read Reddit to get some opinions 
I, like goody, did not start looking into it until later on in the trial, so all I heard was the defense's arguments. What was the credible evidence linking her, other than it being her boyfriend 
I, too, enjoy her "shoulders" 
I, too, have no fucking clue what you're talking about. 
I, too, often fall into the trap of the Twitter echo chamber. I actually uninstalled it from my phone and then my research mentor asked me to reinstall it and follow a bunch of public health people relevant to my project. I dislike it vaf much
I....have to agree with Jordan.....
I.e Josh Gordon 
I.e. I am enrolled in the Partners plan so they wouldn't pay for me to see a doctor through Tufts
I’d actually read that Bocker. Make it happen 
I’d ask for some, but zero chance she knows who I am 
I’d honestly prefer if the season never happened 
I’d just like to mention how terrible you are as a friend because you don’t take me out to lunch 
I’d like to acknowledge that I have a better record than Joe 
I’d like to dispute the result of my matchup with Kovin last night. 
I’d much prefer bills fans to be happy than ravens fans be happy. 
I’d much rather watch highlights of games that already happened along with commentary by pundits who aren’t skilled enough to actually call games than watch a live overtime game 
I’d rather win ugly and have no one else get hurt 
I’d say that you can tell her yourself, but fuck you. You’re not allowed to talk to her 
I’d take FSU 
I’ll be impressed if he ever sees this
I’ll be in Stowe 
I’ll be very content being 7-7 after I beat you this week 
I’ll give you the “I hate the Red Sox” May be a tad negative 
I’ll gladly accept being in the eastern conference if it means that I am dedicated to seeing my good friends @DJ Chanukah and @J--Locke 
I’ll have to remember what the setup process was. I’m pretty sure I had to create a new Microsoft 365 account with my Tufts email and password to activate the installation, but I’ll look back through the instillation manual and double check 
I’ll have to wait for the streaming release. Aspen will talk through the entire movie
I’ll invest $20 into this company 
I’ll just hold this over here 
I’ll know for next year
I’ll let that be a surprise 
I’ll let you know once you send it
I’ll only do deals with #TeamBocker🏌🏿
I’ll only go to Fogo when there is a Measles pandemic 
I’ll save my argument for why you shouldn’t bench our starting quarterback in the national championship game for another day 
I’ll seriously consider it 
I’ll support that motion 
I’ll take his spot. I’m already on the back 9 with my hand up
I’ll take you as a no 
I’ll trade him to you for $20 draft dollars 
I’m a fucking loser
I’m a god
I’m a true Posa champ. 🏆🥇🏅🎖🍆🍑
I’m about to drive to New York.  Can I come after work? 
I’m about to saw into someone’s spine, so I’ll have to pass 
I’m actually going to play in traffic. Faster result 
I’m all about being your friend 
I’m all in on Bocker 
I’m all in on the mariners
I’m already there with popcorn and my hand up. What we watching
I’m also a pretend real stuff guy and probably couldn’t list more than two or three real stars. 
I’m also in this picture tho 
I’m also not on my list 
I’m always a big Bocker fan 
I’m an idiot 
I’m at NFL headquarters trying to burn it down so the league stops fucking Bo
I’m back baby! 
I’m back on #TeamBocker🏌🏿 until he does something to disappoint me like not finish the race this weekend or beat me in fantasy 
I’m being out-homered right now. I don’t know how to feel 
I’m board eligible to take care of my own dying children
I’m choosing to not come 
I’m close to 90%
I’m confused why Heed The Call/ATN minus Gregg isn’t on there 
I’m confused why we benched a Heisman candidate for this scrub
I’m confused, did he leave? I can’t imagine a baseball team would let the only active hall of famer go 
I’m currently in therapy to regain the ability to actually use a spoon. So the answer is no 
I’m currently on the ferry from NY to VT and am reading through the messages in the GroupMe. Having no knowledge of any events tonight, I am excited to hear about how poorly Herbert played and how the Chiefs got bailed out by a roughing the passer call to win their opening game of the season. Surely it didn’t happen any other way. Let me resume scrolling 
I’m currently suffering from the sniffles so obviously I would not have been able to make it 
I’m forced to look at it every time you post 
I’m free every day except the days I’m not free 
I’m generally fine with them but our roommate parks on the street and she was stuck at work from Wednesday until Friday afternoon and came back with no place to park. Not sure how that gets fixed though 
I’m glad I don’t have to wish anyone a Happy Holidays anymore. Thanks Trump!
I’m glad I got my point across 
I’m glad I peer pressured you into staying up 
I’m glad I won’t be called Joophf
I’m glad Joe thinks that any of us are watching the 76ers play on a Friday night in the first week of the season 
I’m glad that there is only one Dr. Andrew Becker who is friends with Alex Warshauer 
I’m glad to be bonded to goody and @skimmer eternally by the truth. 
I’m glad to hear that things are going well for you. You deserve all the success and happiness that comes your way 
I’m going to go back to not participating in this conversation again 
I’m going to miss dissecting buttholes and testicles
I’m going to pass. Climbing half dome 17 times is enough for me 
I’m going to quick the league unless my losses against everyone except my good friends Bocker and Emyr are overturned 
I’m going to send that to your sister 
I’m honored to be in the same group as Jordan and John 
I’m in the back of terminal E with my hand up
I’m in the GPI Posa :(
I’m just happy you’re here, boosh
I’m kind of over celebrating people overcoming challenges and completing long distances races. Let’s just ignore goody’s marathon. 
I’m literally asking the same question 
I’m never not up. 
I’m no Bocker, but my limited math skills seem to indicate that I am in fact not in the Posa 
I’m normally in bed by 11:30. This week has been busier, so I’ve been up til 12:30ish
I’m not @The Big Dick Bandit but the Universal Studios in CA is like a flaming dog turd compared to the US in FL
I’m not around this weekend 
I’m not going to lie, I completely was blanking on the name Safeco and googled it. I had no recollection of going to a field called T Mobile Park but Wikipedia told me that the Mariners have played there since 1999 so I was assuming my memory was all sorts of fucked up 
I’m not going to lie. GroupMe works better on Android than it does on iOS. 
I’m not in. 
I’m not invited to host with you guys? FOH
I’m not sure I could even consider red delicious to be an apple. It’s pretty much a torture device deployed on children who have to buy lunch from school 
I’m not sure that ever happened 
I’m not sure. Can you tell me? 
I’m not surprised that we lost but also think we could have won 
I’m not used to things not working properly 
I’m not voting for John. I’m voting against Bocker. 
I’m not watching that
I’m not, because I don’t have a better record than John 
I’m nothing but nice to you and yet you still try to hurt me 
I’m of the believe that if there is no one worth a #1 pick, you trade down and stack picks, a la Goody 
I’m on the orange line. Hopefully be there soon 
I’m one stop away 
I’m only #JustFacts✅
I’m only up by 3 now 
I’m out of excuses, but no. I do not wish to hold songs 
I’m planning on sitting in front of the tv all day so I’ll still be up for it lol. 
I’m posting both takes some I’m right no matter what 
I’m pro-kickers as long as there isn’t actually a spot to put them in the lineup and they actually don’t exist in our league 
I’m putting a big piece of this loss on coaching decision. Butler played in all the packages this week. Right before game time, Rowe gets told he’s going to start and butler is getting benched 
I’m putting all my money in crispr if I had the ability 
I’m quickly losing my enthusiasm for Romo. He makes too many weird noises 
I’m reading that it was a targeted strike on Hamas leadership. Why is Hamas in Doha? @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) plz explain 
I’m refusing to acknowledge him at this point 
I’m relapsing. Having a bad day with typing. Apologies. 
I’m rooting for me this week
I’m rooting for UCF to get in 
I’m sad that I let Israel distract me from the real headline from yesterday 
I’m seeing Bills fans blaming the loss on the refs. SAD
I’m seeing some gifs on Reddit of BTJ ducking out of throws to avoid getting hit. Has he always been a little bitch? 
I’m sitting at home watching dodgeball instead. 
I’m so #JustFacta✅ rn that it hurts. Sorry that you can’t see the light 
I’m so confused
I’m so confused as to what you’re arguing, Marcus 
I’m so glad I locked this game up for my boy Bocks
I’m so good that people just don’t show up to play when they’re matched up against me 
I’m so surprised
I’m sorry for you 
I’m sorry for your loss
I’m sorry that both of those people, who have applied to grad school, have to represent someone like you 
I’m starting to become confused 
I’m still busy but I figured I would ask
I’m still going to win this week 
I’m still here 
I’m still here trying to figure out how the Bills let the Chiefs’ best receiver get wide open on a 4th and 17
I’m still holding out hope for a stat correct 
I’m streaming it on my phone
I’m stupidly waiting for Tillerson to make his statement in the hopes that he rails against Trump. Not only is he 10 minutes late, there’s no chance he says anything disparaging. Why am I wasting my time 
I’m sure he just muted the groupme because he’s with Angela and doesn’t care about us 
I’m sure our resident anarchist Jordanzer is leading the protests 
I’m sure the federal government, which is providing you with welfare and student loans, is happy about that 
I’m sure there is more, but like you said, what is baseball 
I’m sure there was only one Connor in our class with a large Irish Catholic cohort 
I’m sure they’re all distraught rn
I’m sure this will set their team up for both short and long tern success 
I’m talking over the last week 
I’m thinking it’s a 🐩 move because now he has two people to try and stop him from gambling, banging hookers, and doing lines of coke in the casino bathroom
I’m thinking the former 
I’m trying to copy you and work on my fantasy defense 
I’m up 5 pounds from graduation, but up 10 pounds from my lowest post-graduation weight. However making progress getting back down to ideal. Go me. 
I’m using the fidelity vanguard 2055. Not sure I can get more middle of the pack than that 
I’m very anti-gender reveal parties for the same reason as my good friend @Skimmer. I feel like that will change when someone I am close with has a kid though 
I’m very well aware you don’t eat breakfast besides the protein you take in from blowing that random dude named Chester behind the target in Central Sq every morning 
I’m waiting for the shoe to drop and for Goody to admit that he’s been watching the wnba for 2 years as an elaborate troll 
I’m waiting for when Tonga lines up at fullback and they do the quick fullback handoff thing in short yardage and he just blows the fuck up out of the line
I’m waiting until Marcus doesn’t invite me, then I’ll pull out that line 
I’m watching the highlights on YouTube and Drake is really running the offense well. Had some really good tuck and runs, set up blockers well. Threw into some really tight windows, like the 4th and 3 to Diggs. Those long throws to Boutte are sexy as fuck. The adjustment by Pop on his TD was a smart heads up play knowing where the free safety was
I’m with Bocker and Darrow. This is a pussy storm. 
I’m with Chan
I’m working until 3am in NY/Canada tonight and then 7am in NY/Canada on Sunday so unfortunately will not be able to make it down for the game 
I’m worried that Frankie didn’t think that people can change
I’ve already applied to grad school, ipso facto, I’m smarter than you and thus have not learned anything from you or your fantasy league 
I’ve also never seen anyone partial to a brand of salt, just a type of salt (granulated vs. sea salt vs. kosher salt vs pink Himalayan salt) 
I’ve always been. Never doubted them or Addazio 
I’ve always done that 
I’ve called my senator to ask him to deport Goody. Hasn’t worked yet 
I’ve come to expect it 
I’ve created a monster 
I’ve gotten emails to Jeffery and Jefferey in the last week
I’ve had maybe two in person conversations with Erin in my life 
I’ve kind of exhausted my capacity to listen to marcus talk 
I’ve literally wanted nothing more in my life
I’ve never had dental insurance, so I know nothing about it 
I’ve never heard of someone working for a company that doesn’t count MLK day as a holiday. I would find a new job, Chan, because your company is run by terrorists who hate freedom 
I’ve never seen anything so delegitimized by the US not being in a tournament 
I’ve never seen the two of you in a room together. 
I’ve run out of clean pants since noon when Tom released his new video on Facebook 
I’ve successfully bullied a friend into participating two years in a row. Both times they’ve come in last 
Ian Eagle and Dan Foutes*
Ian rapaport reported we can appeal the fine 
Ian rapaport told Kevin white on Tuesday the Bears were going to pick him. He was right 
"Ian Rapaport: Jets targeting wide receiver in the first round. 

Jets don't have a qb to throw to him..."

I'd actually like to switch peanut butter cookies for my mom's forgotten cookies. They are meringue cookies with chocolate chips and rice krispies in them but instead of cooking them normally, you heat up an oven, turn it off, and then put the cookies in the warm oven over night. They come out crunchy on the outside but gooey and soft (heh) on the inside
I'd actually like to thank my good friend Jordan, an AF intelligence officer, that another big terrorist attack didn't happen. 
I'd already rather go through the self-checkout line to limit interaction with other humans (pre-COVID)
I'd also add that it would be helpful if more than 45% of the US (in a good year) gets vaccinated against the flu. It will help decrease capacity in hospitals, and there may be fewer instances of febrile illness where we have to figure out whether the patient has the flu or COVID
I'd also agree with becks and Joe. At first, I thought Becker was being lame, but he has a fair reason not to go to chan's and it is pretty shitty to just leave him out, despite the fact that he's coming up to golf/draft with us. I appreciate the fact that Chan is willing to host but I think it would be better for all of the fuckholes if we went to Becker's 
I'd also argue that the caliber of receiver that manning threw to for most of his career was far better than Brady's receivers, which would increase his stats. The only receiver Brady had that will make the hall of fame is Moss, and he only had him for 3 seasons. Welker might make it, but so did manning and I don't really think welker's value in the slot compares to what Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne were able to give to manning 
I'd also like to thank the Giants for proving me right when I said that it was a stupid move to draft Barkley #2. Don't see them winning games because of his freaky athleticism 
I'd argue that the Thompson Twins were the most low key members in ems 
I'd ask Morcus to come pick me up at DCA if we don't make this flight but he's no longer in here and I definitely lost his number 
I'd be done paying my undergrad loans back if I have paid $100/month through school 
I'd be down to go on John's dime once Kloee sells for a billion 
I'd be embarrassed to go there, regardless of the abbreviation 
I'd be honored to have @Mr.StealYoGurl steal my gurl. 
I'd be like Lacy
I'd be more willing to pay $50 if 1) #TeamBocker didn't oppose the $50 fee and 2) if Joe didn't lie to me when he told me that the MFF league dues were $5
I'd be ok with a jets win if it means Becker gets knocked out of the tourney 
I'd be pissed if I was jarmond 
I'd be rattled too if I got blown out by Marcus 
I'd be remiss to not acknowledge how unfortunate it is that McCain has a brain tumor. Hoping he gets better. 
I'd be talking about the outcome of the overtime and not some dumb, arbitrary play to decide who gets the ball first....
I'd borrow Frank and bring him there all the time 
I'd catch your body during all hours of the day 
I'd consider using Kloee 
I'd cook for you if you moved in with me 
I'd definitely want to be stuck between ruggles and forest hills. That seems safe 
I'd do it at a bread factory before a Red Sox game 
I'd donate a med school to bc and accept only me and Becker 
I'd endorse it 
I'd fire gruden today 
I'd fire Romeo Crennel first
I'd go for it. What's the odds of an apartment burning down twice? 
Id go Joe but I expect you to still get me that dope hat
I'd have my shirt off in a heartbeat
I'd have to choose lobster, because if everyone stopped eating them, they would for sure take us over 
I'd issue a formal complaint. I am a snitch 
I'd just run the wildcat all game 
I'd leave him to fend for himself 
I'd like the record to show that another Fuckhole besides Joff had renters insurance 
I'd like to amend my statement. Trypanosoma cruzi is the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Chagas disease is spread by Triatomines poop so take that Triatomines loves. 
"I'd like to brighten your day with a poem:

Roses are red
Violets are blue
JJ Watt sucks
And Becker does too "
I'd like to change my generic joke to "It wasn't very original"
I'd like to dispute the numbers on CC medicine. That likely counts call hours which doesn't always mean you're coming into work if there are residents/fellows under you. Also the major academic institutions have enough clinicians on staff that you are only on call for a week each month or so. The rest of the time is spent doing research or teaching, which obviously is less rigorous than treating patients. I think that number is very misleading 
I'd like to imagine someone giving Trump the MOCA daily until he memorized everything
Id like to rescind my recommendation for s town. I'm on episode 6 of 7 and I've been very bored for the last two and a half episodes 
I'd like to revise my statement. He was my keeper for $16
I'd like to see him try 
I'd like to survive long enough to make getting into med school worth it 
Id like to take this time to remind goody how well Harmon has played all year 
I'd like to think that if a Democrat was a science denier who claimed COVID was a hoax and blamed doctors for artificially inflating death counts to get more money, the medical community would also be disappointed if they were first in line to get a vaccine.
I'd like to think that too but I have to be #JustFacts✔️
I'd look to see who's on your roster but I CANT GET INTO THE FUCKING APP
I'd love for Emyr to prove me wrong here 
I'd love some creative play calling that gets Drake Maye on the move 
I'd love to be Matt Flynn. Guy has made more money as a back up because he has had two good games stepping in for injured players. But he's never been good enough to ever start 
I'd love to but I'm going to be away that weekend. Hope you get heckled by pats fans for bringing a bills fan to the game 
I'd love to see his google calendar. Probably color coded and shit 
I'd love to throw a G down on a 3 hour football game that I'd have a better and more comfortable vantage point of from my couch, especially after an expensive trip to Europe, but you didn't plan this far enough in advance
I'd never take food that you had grown. Zero chance it wouldn't be laced with rat poison 
I'd never tell him that you said that. 
I'd offer to draft for Bocker but I know how big of a competitive advantage that is for everyone else 
I'd post that the groupme is not lit, but I am get the feeling that some members of the GroupMe don't think that what qualifies as a constructive post 
I'd probably be 28% more likely to vote for trump if he could pardon Brady 
I'd probably choose Tyreek over Julio
I'd probably go for a blackberry rosemary ice cream myself, but I will allow the alternative fruit/herb combination
I'd probably just end myself now if that was me
I'd put hockey natty up there. I know it's not as big of a sport and it wasn't an upset but oh well 
I'd quit before the day is over. Get out of there while you can. 
I'd rather abs than tattoos 
I'd rather be a 🐩 than a ^
I'd rather be closer to a pokestop
I'd rather be fat than be a bitch 
I'd rather be Obama. He didn't have slaves since he was from Kenya
I'd rather be spooned by goody than watch a minute of that show 
I'd rather be watching the broncos right now 
I'd rather castrate myself with a blowtorch and bleach my eyeballs 
I'd rather comform and be right than be a "free thinker" and be wrong 
I'd rather continue being salty
I'd rather draw asbestos 
I'd rather eat a leather shoe covered with flour than a single crumb of pizza from Dominos
I'd rather eat E. coli spiked gluten 
I'd rather fine people for smoking. It harms other people and children/people with lung issues/etc can be really negatively affected by other people smoking 
I'd rather get a 1st and more now than a 3rd round compensatory pick when he walks next year 
Id rather get my cavity filled today than trust you. 
Id rather go play pickup soccer than watch pretty much any game, short of the world cup championship if it has two counties I actually care about 
I'd rather go run 100 miles in the Sahara or wherever 
I'd rather have a more affordable education. I'm not suggesting free, but maybe costs should rise at the rate of inflation, not faster 
I'd rather have my L's. I'm more comfortable with failure 
I'd rather just automatically be ripped and in shape and good looking without trying. 
I'd rather just keep everything the same if we are going to talk about changing everything 
I'd rather let him become a pandering asshat and then we have something to shame him about for the rest of his life. Or until something else happens next week and we forget 
I'd rather live with Darrowball than that scumbag backstabbing @Joey Brackets 
I'd rather lose the way we did than to lose like that 
I'd rather Mookie and Roberts win unfortunately
I'd rather not get my butthole raped 
I'd rather not have to flee to Russia to start a new life with a fake identity 
I'd rather not use your tax dollars on taking the SAT. Buy in is fine but would prefer lower
I'd rather passionately embrace JJ Watt
I'd rather pay Dingers
I'd rather pick a team that I am confident will win so I can survive with a chance to win money. I think most of us are not taking other individuals' picks into account 
I'd rather pierce my pupils with rusty nails while strapped to a chair covered in razor blades listening to a recording of Joe saying "Did you know I studied abroad in Barcelona?" on repeat 
I'd rather starve than see @Joey Brackets 
I'd rather the GroupMe not be lit 
I'd rather trade for a left tackle so Seabass can play his normal side and we don't need to rely on Marcus cannon 
I'd rather use cotija 
I'd rather watch golf with Becker 
I'd rather watch golf with becker than watch a college basketball or NBA game 
I'd rather Watt suck 
I'd report that car to the city. Can't have citizens like that living among us in this pandemic
I'd respond to your DMs 
I'd run with you if you came to Boston 
I'd say 20 once they pass me at bc. I'll give you a heads up if I can 
Id say about 30 seconds, when Ryan reads this and remembers that he can kick Becker out of the groupme 
I'd say I've seen 2 people wearing masks out of about 30, and maybe 8 or 9 people holding masks or having them in their pockets. I'm a big mask guy, not a big no-mask guy 
I'd say more people fly with a carry-on than don't, but maybe that is an emotionally-driven answer with no data to support it
I'd say you could buy a Fitbit but then we will never know if the results are skewed since the motion of jacking off tricks the Fitbit into thinking you are running 
I'd sign Peyton for two games 
"I'd suggest some sort of uniform budget across all schools to level the playing field and reduce the impact of individual school sponsors, but I'd get lambasted from Bocker and Marcus for:
a) trying to professionalize college sports by instituting a salary cap
b) not respecting that parity exists between conferences and schools in non-P5 conferences would still have fewer resources and thus may struggle to pay out their entire cap space, while P5 schools would have an easier time"
I'd take the "goody during bc football games after graduation" approach and just go to a bar to drink
I'd trade Cam to Dallas at halftime. Is that allowed?
I'd turn him down so fast 
I'd volunteer but I don't want any material I find to be misconstrued as an opinion, which I am not allowed to have
Ideally yes. Many systems as they exist now require you to prove (either by symptoms or clinical judgement) that you deserve a certain therapy. Example: many of the patients in my research cohort had to try an oral medication before they went on a biologic because of cost, even though the biologic would likely be way more effective

IDIOT Jordan. You can't personally sue for a HIPAA violation. Only the AG can bring an offending institution to court

Idris Elba testing positive for Covid19. My condolences to @Skimmer 
If @The Big Dick Bandit weren’t MIA, he would say something like “wow, what a fucking dweeb posting what your girlfriend got you on Valentine’s Day” but he’s not here so I guess it will go unsaid 
If 2016 and Kap taught us anything, he won't exercise his voting rights anyway
If a business can open with capacity for social distancing, I am #ProOpening
If a decision is not reached yet, he is likely to be granted an injunction. If the suspension is upheld, Brady's lawyers have to prove that they have a reasonable chance of winning an appeal in order for a judge to issue an injunction. And if the federal district judge upholds the suspension, it isn't likely Brady will win an appeal 
If a drug gets approved for hypertension after a phase III study, if you find out it works to treat anxiety, you can prescribe it for anxiety. You don't need a phase III trial to do that
If a Pats player got that unnecessary roughness call, I would be vaf upset.
If a question ever starts, "should I be like joff..." the answer is probably no 
If Adam Silver had any shred of integrity, he would release his emails
If all videos could be viewed in that manner, I would watch videos in the groupme
If all your patients are coding, that isn't a brag
If and when I lose in the playoffs, at least it will happen against my best friends
If anesto deep dicks Angela before Darrowball, she can go right ahead and lose my number. 
If any Fuckholes want to come hang out, Olivia and I are seeing Mumford and Noah Kahan in VT on Thursday. GA tickets are still available 
If any of you play skiball by throwing side arm, lose my number. 
If any of you were wasting your talents, I would tell you point blank how I felt. That's why I tell goody everyday that he's a useless piece of shit 
If any one legitimately roots for their fantasy player over their NFL team, they deserve to be slowly tortured and then murdered 
If anyone besides Chan knew you were referencing "Jalen and Jacoby" when you used the abbreviation J&J without any context, I'd be shocked 
If anyone cares (read: @Boe Jourque ), the SpaceX crew that launched up to the ISS two months ago is getting ready to depart. Departure should be around 730 EST tonight
If anyone could, Ryan could 
If anyone deserves to be fired (no one does), it's Danny Ainge for putting together a team of mediocre players and one 5'7" scorer who is a defensive liability 
If anyone has pictures or videos from my wedding that have not yet been shared in the GroupMe, please kindly text them to me. Making a collaboration album of everyone's pictures from the day
If anyone is around and doesn't mind watching an espn3 stream, I'm happy to have people over for the game/Catan
If anyone is bored, I thought that this was a good article about the current actions we are taking and how they are not enough, backed up with data and colored figures/drawings
If anyone is even considering counting me out in my matchup against Marcus, you're dead to me. Also, lose my number. 
If anyone is interested in ax throwing again
If anyone needs a ticket to the game Saturday, I got one to give away. But it's a physical ticket, so you'll have to pick it up somewhere 
If anyone wants a $10 gift certificate thing to tasca, let me know. Expires at the end of the month 
If anyone wants to come over and be snowed in with me while I study, I’ll give you access to my Catan game and heady topper/focal banger. Who says no 
If anyone wants to play Warzone with Joff, Joff will be logging in momentarily
If anything, clowney is playing better because he has a great player in Mercilus on the line with him. He didn't have another good DLineman stepping up earlier in the season.
If anything, finding my Johnson would be infinitely more difficult if it were smaller 
If anything, he should have left the pocket to give Drake someone else to throw to
If anything, it means more time for your house flipping project 
If anything, it's a disturbing trend and you should figure out why your presence invokes death on innocent people 
If anything, it's Black Friday weekend 
If anything, that should be 15 yards on Dak
If anything, that's an challenge to see if you can get caught 
If Arizona drafts Kyler and the Raiders take Haskins fourth overall, they have a chance to get a younger, cheaper pass rusher and some other impact player in the first round with their other two picks. That's a pretty good haul if you ask me
If BB told me to run into an isis controlled town with nothing but a shoe string and a butter knife, you fucking know I will kill all those fucking terrorists to make him happy 
If BC doesn’t put up at least 60, they might as well have lost this game
If BC loses this weekend, does Daz get fired? (Before you day anything @Jordan Kelleher, I am NOT rooting for BC to lose) 
If Becker commits, is that 6 of us or five of us?
If Becker dies, does that mean he forfeits this week? 
If Becker had like two years to train, he could win a UFC fight 
If Becker's dress shirt picture didn't get 12 likes, nothing in this groupme will 
If bengals don't win this game, does everyone go back to "Andy dalton can't win big stage games. He isn't a good quarterback." Or does he get a pass for playing pretty well 
If Bernie gets elected, does everyone in the league serve a fraction of Brady's suspension?
If Biden wanted to be equitable, he would completely erase all debt across all loan categories for everyone except the rich and/or beltway elite. 
If Bijan is as game changing as advertised, I feel like you just take him instead of trading back to get a less special player but what do I know 
If Bock knew before reading in this GroupMe, I'm gonna be so disappointed 
If Bocker dislikes Bautista, then I wholeheartedly agree with JBoss 
If bocker was a good friend, he would elaborate without my involvement 
If Bocker's wedding was this fall (and if he was getting married to some I liked and respected less than Kristen), I would totally propose during his first dance 
If body mass is all it takes, I should be able to hit 80 by now
If Brady doesn't win the super bowl, the only quarterback who deserves it is Bortles imo
If Brady is exonerated, he plays right away, but the NFL can appeal to the second circuit of appeals 
If Brady is on that show, I will never speak his name again. He will be dead to me
If Brock Purdy retired today, he'd be in the HoF
If BU kills Darrow, that would kinda suck 
If by "no one will talk about this," you mean "no one in my immediate sphere will talk about this to me because they think I'm too ignorant to care about global issues, but plenty of people still care about the issue," then yes 
If by best you mean most injured, then yes 
If by BS loan programs, you mean loan forgiveness after 10 years of qualifying payments (which require you to work for a "non profit" aka any hospital not owned by Stewart) then sure 
If by buns, you mean going to be the best game of the week....
If by good, you mean captivating and the subject of lots of discussion afterwards, it was
If by laying the wood, you mean doing a 3 hour long core and piriformis workout while listening to Adele, then yes.
If by pound pussy, you mean get naked, become emotional, curl up in the fetal position, and cry myself to sleep, then I am definitely number 1 on the list 
If by successful, you mean a complete failure, sure. 
If by they, you mean me, then yes. I stitched a mask onto his face and locked him in a warehouse in Fall River.
If by working, you mean solo squading up, then yes 
If Chan's doesn't work out, you're always welcome at my apartment, though I won't have a car to get around this weekend. Also down to hang out
If Danny is thinking about getting rid of Tatum, I'm revoking my self-declared status of Keltics mega-fan
If Darrow got an iPhone, he's officially dead to me
If Darrowball was there, the landmark was important enough 
If defending my friend Becker makes me a 🐳, then so be it. 
If DonDon2.0 is so against players kneeling, he should just create a rival football league and run it his own way
If DT was drafted in 2010, that means Joshy drafted him
If Duncan was a real competitor, he would have gone to a non-Championship caliber team and turn it around 
If el pelon was in Somerville, I wouldn't be able to afford my rent 
If elway has a shred of intelligence, he will make this Brock's team 
If Emyr hasn't caught it yet, it doesn't exist. 
If emyr passing the bar doesn't get 12 likes, I have no hope for this group 
If Emyr wins, the Giants super bowl victories are validated. (Started out shitty and then came back to win it). If goody is a true patriots fan, he'd take that into consideration 
If everyone gets the question wrong, then it must be a bad question 
If everyone is going to dehydrate then rehydrate, I also don't get why people don't just fight at their weights. If two fighters are both 160 but they dehydrate down to 145, then rehydrate back up to 160, is there even a point to it?
If Farrell wants to win (aka if he wants to keep his job), Pablo will be "hurt" all year 
If free. Then yes. If anything more than free. Then no. 
If girls could use my bathroom, there would never be toilet paper. Y'all know how I feel about my toilet paper 
If Gisele can stay there, you'll survive 
If Goodell and bettman somehow procreated together, their offspring would be more well liked than commissioner goody
If goody can make that weekend, we should probably just cancel the trip 
If goody didn’t get himself uninvited from Maggie’s wedding for his patriarchy comments, I think I’m still good 
If goody is picking the Seahawks I may want to change my answer 
If goody stops being a bitch and takes a team himself 
If gronk misses any time with this injury, at least I can take solace in the fact that Becker will lose his best player down the stretch. Here's to hoping someone knocks him out of the playoffs!
If Groupme out posts you in a 6 month period, you are replaced with a bot
If he actually does retire, I want him hired as a defensive assistant ASAP. Dude reads the defense so well 
If he ain't winning games, he ain't worth the money 
If he burns down the fake Notre Dame, as my good friend Bocker suggested, I will give him my vote
If he can bust with Ricky there, that's pretty concerning. 
If he did that last part, he’d have to be part of #JustFacts✅
If he did, I still haven't gotten an invite to play
if he didn't ask for it then why was he bending over wearing that uniform 
If he didn't do it, he should be hiring Michael Avenatti to shout his innocence from every mountain top in the continental United States
If he didn't leave you off of the list, he immediately needs to be fired 
If he dies, they should be charged with manslaughter. Full stop. 
If he does, he's a copycat
If he doesn't care about his personal safety, neither do I 
If he doesn't hit Lebron with a chair, then the whole thing is a sham 
If he doesn't, he will be labeled as a skimmer. 
If he existed 
If he gets arrested
If he got "super high" off of Benadryl, he should reexamine his life
If he had a concussion last week, he'd be at risk for secondary impact syndrome 🙃
If he had to vote*
If he hasn't posted the meme, it isn't the weekend. Jeez 
If he included data about ties, it would only strengthen the claim that the rules are fine
If he isn't, he should be
If he makes a @WhiteBreadBot then he never needs to post again
If he makes less sense now, that’s a scary thought 
If he needed a heart transplant, I would give him mine
If he or she had an allergic reaction to dried apricots, maybe cut out anything with dried fruit or stonefruits and see what happens
If he shows you his penis on the first date, he’s part of the patriarchy. Run away. 
If he transfers somewhere he has to sit out a year right? I still don't understand transfer eligibility rules 
If he wants to get anywhere in the NFL, he should start whipping his son, not encouraging positivity via social media 
If he was as elite as Brady, he could have thrown and caught that 
If he was such a great guy, then why does he have a generic predisposition to getting blood clots??
If he was truly a dedicated athlete, he would be jacking off with both hands to improve his ambidextrous stamina. No reason he can't complete the challenge today 
If he was, it wouldn't be smart to do it until he signs an extension or with another team. It's fucked up, but I could see something like that affecting not the money he gets in free agency 
If he wins, I may have to leave the GroupMe for a few weeks 
If he won the fight*
If he works a full 8 hour day, not including a break (we work 8.5 hours in my office and have a .5 lunch break, I don't know how it works elsewhere)
If he’s healthy
If he’s not almost dying to win this bet, it shows he has no fight in him 
If he's so smart, why isn't he at a better school than Harvard Med?
If Hilary loses, I vote that she has to take the SATs and the rest of the Fuckholes are exempt 
If his ex is fine with it, who are you to judge
If his injury were serious, he wouldn't be a bitch. Your injury wasn't serious. 
If his rehab goes well, he has the potential to be work pretty much exactly what I will need to pay to keep him next year, and it means I have a good running back without having to fight over him in an auction with you fuckers. Which is good news because every player in the first few rounds went for more than they were valued 
If human bodies were cuts of meat, the dad bod would skew more marbled rib eye than filet mignon; or, if human bodies were sea mammals, dad bod would be more like a grazing manatee than a speedy dolphin. The dad bod is more mudslide than mountain, more soft serve than sorbet, more sad trombone than clarinet, more mashed potato than skinny fry. The dad bod is built for comfort.
If I am going to suck, I want to at least suck more than everyone else 
If I am the Broncos, I have the team walk out to the field at the beginning of the 3rd quarter and take a collective shit over the nfl seal 
If I am the lone dissenting vote, I will pay $50
If I am the OC, I am calling two runs. You have two plays and 3 timeouts to get 2 feet
If I am the Patriots, which I am, I trade up to pick Michael Mayer
If I am the Patriots, which I am, I wait patiently for my pick to take Luke Schoonmaker
If I am the Pats, I am calling the ners now to trade Christian Gonzalez, Matt Judon, and Robert Kraft for Purdy 
If I bench my fantasy team for the rest of the season, I'd have as good of a chance of winning a game as I do starting my best players 
If I can win 5 games in a season, anything is possible
If I come, I can’t complain anymore. So I can’t make it 
If I could call any of you friends before this conversation (that's a big if), I certainly can't now. 
If I could put a plug in for somewhere other than the Utah area, Seattle is not too expensive to fly into and is very close to some amazing national parks. I think my flight there was like $300 RT, rented a car for two days for about $100 and went to Ranier and Olympic National Parks. Was definitely not as hot as Utah and was just as beautiful
If I could take credit for killing the MCU people for good, I would do that in a heartbeat
If I could, I would pick you Darrow. No one I would rather lose to 
If I did anything negative to her, I stand by whatever I did
If I did know who he was, im sure that I'd think that he was a loser. Joff is a winner and is in first place 
If I didn't have class I would be there with a lounge chair and cooler of beer (both gluten free for me and Marcus and extra gluten for goody)
If I gave a shit about Tiger King, I think I would say something like Fuck Carole Baskin or something dumb like that
If I had a dollar every time another AFC east was prime to overtake the pats, id have at least 7 dollars. 
If I had a dollar for every time I ran out of water two days into a 7 day, 67 mountain hike.....
If I had a dollar for everything that should "have an effect"
If I had a house, I would mortgage it on the chiefs rn
If I had a nickel for every patient who died "in my arms," I'd probably be sued for malpractice or something 
If I had posted a picture of Valentine’s Day socks, I can only imagine how irate Bocker would have gotten 
If I had the money, I would love to 
If I had to guess, I would say that people who disassociate themselves from you in real life are more successful too 
If I had to guess, I would say that the online menu for F&tK will be updated. I follow them on Insta and they haven't said anything about the menu being that limited. Maybe worth giving them a call, too
If I had to travel out there as much as kovin does, I would have ripped my arm out of my socket too 
If I head there now, I can meet you there and still make it back for my 11 pm shift
If I jump off he Tobin, lose my number. 
If I know kovin, and remember that he was always my roommate, he was definitely the one doing the fighting
If I know Marcus, I think he's torn up inside about not giving you a chance to get at that pee hole 
If i left every time my someone talked trash about my team...
If I lied about how bad the T was today, it would ruin my credibility. 
If I made a TikTok every time I had a patient die on me
If I never go to Florida again, I would not be disappointed
If I never watch a cowboys game again, with the exception of any Pats-Boys game, I would die happier 
If I played for the Knicks, I would definitely jump off the Tobin 
If I pleased 30% of people, I would consider that a win 
If I recall, Jboss bought you that book for Christmas? 
If I remember correctly, she also doesn't write most of her own music either. (Don't Google that because I may be making that up and don't want to be exposed as being wrong)
If I remember correctly, the BC paige was much hotter 
If I remember to record it tomorrow at work, I will send it 
If I rest, people die 
If I send you a dick pic, you can do whatever you want with it. If I save it to my phone, my assumption is that it's my private picture
If I squint really hard, like really really hard, I can see a tiny bit of Don Don in that dude's face 
If I start a GoFundMe to pay for TSwift tickets and airfare/hotel to a concert, how many of you can I put down for a $1000 donation? 
If I start Michel and Fournette, zero chance they put up any meaningful points. If I leave them on my bench, I'm expecting 3 touchdowns each
If I still had the micropenis/grammar screenshot, I would post it here. Let's just imagine that I did. 
If I want a side of HepC, I'll gladly visit the Kelly's on revere beach 
If I wanted to get HepC and a sunburn, I would go somewhere fun like South Beach 
If I wanted to rain on Joe's parade, I would mention that broken bones in the neck are not uncommon in deaths by hanging and are not exclusive to stangulation. But I'd like him to continue posting conspiracy theories and articles from 3rd tier news sources 
If I was allowed to leave my house, I would have plenty of time to see you now that my rotations are over! 
If I was an asshole, I would make a comment like, "but Drachman, the question said 'sport'" but I'm not that kind of guy 
If I was in charge of cfb, teams that suck would get relegated to FCS
If I was racist like @#JustFacts✅  I would say something like "emyr knows how to dance."
If I was still in their groupme, I would announce it 
If I was watching this game, I would comment on the inability of anyone on Iowa not named Clark to score 
If I wasn't already in debt and without any shifts for the next two weeks, I would come. But I have no money to spend 
If I watched videos in the GroupMe, I would have played this out loud and Olivia would not have understood the joke until I had to explain it to her. 
If I watched videos in the GroupMe, I would say something to the effect of "that was a very tame 'confrontation'"
If I watched videos, I would say that that was mildly funny 
If I were a betting man, which I am not, I would say NY is next, followed by MA
If I were a chick, I'd be on that 
If I were a former MC student, I would be repressing all my memories too 
If I were a horrible person, I would say something along the lines of "Kind of like when those victims were blindsided with the bullets from an assault rifle"
If I were a lesser man, I would make a joke about how my dick never gets cold because it's in your mother's mouth while doing a Sean Connery on Celebrity Jeopardy accent. But I'm a gentleman so I won't do that 
If I were a sports bettor, I would put my life savings on MD
If I were a woman, I would legally have to concede your point but as a man, I have a say over my body and I say my asshole is neither wide nor a wife 
If I were able to join, I would sing Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield. So someone should sing that in my honor 
If I were back on team #JustFalse❌ I would say something like “yeah, when you ‘took’ the SATs.” But we all know you did and that’s why I’m on team #JustFacts✅
If I were invited, I would play offense, defense, special teams, or all the above. I would give it my all because I wouldn't take playing flag football with my friends for granted
If I were Joe and Jamie, I wouldn't even show my face at family gatherings now. No one loves them anymore. 
If I were on the fence and my coach Lovie Smith'd me, I would fire him in mediately too 
If I were pandering, I would have done something like send you a Tom Brady highlights video from Sunday’s game. 
If I were Theo, I wouldn't take the job back. 
If I were to do BC over again, I would devote myself to Pelon instead of Chipotle
If I were to have watched that video, I would rate it a 2/10
If I were to watch that video, which I didn't because I don't watch videos in the GroupMe and I would never break that #Narrative, I would say something like "C+ video at best"
If I were watching the game, I would want to know whether Brown's pass that went into the backcourt was tipped or not 
If I were watching this game, I would make a satirical comment about how that was a great play 
If I work more than 50 hours a week, you best believe you'll be working that too. 
If I’m Joe Bourque, I would have already hired Pitino 
If I’m the Browns new GM (I think it’s John Dorsey, but I don’t want to say the wrong thing and be lambasted), the only think I could do now is immediately retire, right? This already looks like it’s going to be a failure 
If I'm a boss, I'd want to know that my clients are having positive experiences with my employees, just as much as I'd want to know if they are having negative experiences. I agree with Jordan 
If I'm an NFL team, I'm stockpiling picks for 18 years until TB12's son is ready to play 
If I'm BB (with a bye locked up), I rest TB, gronk, butler, mccourty, Edelman, (provided he's back), stork. I'll give the starters a quarter of snaps and then sit them, play the scrubs for the rest of the game 
If I'm BB, I'm calling my friend BoB to give him some tips on how to beat the raiders without an offense 
If I'm Bill, I send an operative to infiltrate the Jets and have them trade Sam Darnold for a 7th to the Pats, and then I extend him for the veteran minimum and then developing him into the next Tom Brady in a single off-season
If I'm depraved, I don't want to know what the rest of you are
If I'm getting a fried appetizer of any kind, get me freedom fries
If I'm going to lose my medical license, it's going to be for something fun like prescribing 420 BDPs to @goodybot
If I'm Jed York, i rescind my offer to Kyle Shanahan for calling an endzone fade play 
If I'm Leahy, I don't even let Bates or Addazio get on the plane home 
If I'm making sure an ingredient is gf, I usually just Google it. There is an app I used to use but it cost money and wasn't always updated. 
If I'm not Bocker's boss, can someone tell me why he keeps asking me for help with a project on which I am not even working? 
If I'm not illiterate and am reading the spreadsheet correctly, joe and jordan are there only ones without perfect brackets so far
If I'm not mistaken, I think we just added a new fight to the beatdown in beantown card 
If I'm not on time, blame the t for making me wait 10 minutes for a train 
If I'm their new coach, I don't take a job with a trash team like the Colts if Luck isn't expected to be back soon. If he did, he's dumb
If I'm wrong, I have to be wrong about everything
If it all goes to shit, you all are still welcome to come up and we can get some heady topper and find something other than skiing to do 
If it did, I was not there 
If it does, it can get $10k forgiven later 
If it doesn’t taste like Dunks, baked beans, and lobster rolls, get it out of my mouth
If it doesn't get posted in the groupme, it hasn't happened 
If it doesn't happen, it's because of you and Joe being to cheep to make the right investment 
If it doesn't interest bocker or joff, it isn't interesting 
If it ends up being Bernie vs trump, who you guys going to support?
If it existed
If it existed 
If it existed 
If it exists, there's porn of it in the interwebs
If it happened at the 1 and it was 3rd down, offense gets 4th and goal from the 1
If it influences your decision, I won't be there Ryan. Might make you more likely to go 
If it is first thing in the morning, I put on deodorant first. But I don't workout, so my opinion doesn't count 
If it isn't stated in the GroupMe, it didn't happen. Just trying to make sure it happened.
If it makes you feel any better, at least you were invited to Chicago 😭
If it makes you feel any better, my tight end put up a goose egg and Big Ben doesn't have 50 points against the fucking Colts 
If it makes you feel any better, one of the second year residents is having visa issues so I have to help cover his overnights so I got an extra call shift added on that weekend. Just for an extra kick in the nuts 
If it makes you feel better Becker, I hurt my knee running a 5k last Saturday. The struggle is real 
If it makes you feel better Bocker, Katelynn and the Browns were saying the same thing at Kovin’s on Saturday 
If it makes you feel better goody, I just picked up JFF with the sole purpose of owning JFF. So who ever wants fuckhead Eli manning, be my guest 
If it makes you feel worse Jordan, currently working on two papers with my two physician bosses. They both have requested to list me as first author on both publications. 
If it matters that much, than why is UCF not in the playoffs but one loss teams are 
If it pisses off Becker, keep doing it 
If it was a good movie, you would have seen it
If it was a typo, you'd know 
If it was just Darrow and Emyr, I'd be there in a heartbeat 
If it was just you at the game, think about how much they'd lose in beer revenue. I mean you drink a keg or two but not all of them 
If it was the last game of the season, I wasn’t working and I was at your tailgate for most of the pregame 
If it wasn't for a roughing the passer on their first drive, they would have put up 6 at home 
If it were just me, I definitely would move in with John in Somerville. But Olivia and I are trying to get our own place
If it were Kelce, I would hope that Taylor would leave the game and never text him back. Can't have TSwift dating a little bitch 
If it’s any consolation, Bocker, I beat Darrow in week 1, and then you beat me, so by the transitive property, you’re 1-1 against Darrow 
If it's a doctor's recommendation, it should be free. If it's a patient's request, they should pay. Obviously it's never that cut and dry but that's how I feel 
If it's about power, then the show's cast should be full of straight, white men. Like trump's cabinet. 
If it's an acl (I have no clue, didn't see the injury), he might not be ready for the start of the season 
If it's not in the groupme, it's not true 
If it's not the GPI, I wouldn't count it 
If it's up to the public and Congress to decide the fate of the president, it's incumbent on the impartial Justice department (of which Mueller is a consultant) to accurately portray the investigation's findings. Obviously the author of the report did not believe that that happened. 
If it's your betting market, the Dems have it in the bag 
If JBoss isn't doing coke off of some model's ass with Gronk tonight, I say it's pretty much a wasted trip 
If jets d doesn't put up 25 tonight, I'd be shocked 
If JJ is free, best know that he and @jordanbot will be getting loading dock loaded 
If Joe Bourque doesn't know him, can you really be sure he even exists? 
If Joe ever started a physical altercation with me, I would just play the John Cena prank call video to quell his anger
If Joe is in here, we can’t be that exclusive 
If Joe is just realizing that this is my year, then he has been skimming the GroupMe relentlessly
If Joe is wearing jeans, you know that's the cool thing to do 
If Joe was a good house guest, he would make it for you 
If Joe was a real friend he would have told us this yesterday so we could have all bought stock in ge. It rose 9% after the announcement 
If joe was truly smart, he'd strip Kevin of David Johnson 
If joff couldn't get gronk or Aaron Rodgers when Chan quit the league for the first time, Marcus doesn't deserve thielen 
If John isn’t going to deliver, I’m going to take matters into my own hands 
If John loved us he would throw everything positive in his life away to participate more with us
If Jordan and Emyr win tonight, you guys are going to have to break into my house to stop be from drowning myself in a bathtub 
If Jordan doesn't ask that during his best man speech, I vote he isn't allowed to be in the groupme anymore
If Jordan truly deserved that, he wouldn't be living in NM right now
If Josh wins the Super Bowl, @The Big Drake Bandit may die from dehydration
If Judge was a top guy, he wouldn't have disappeared in the playoffs (*hopes Judge performed poorly in the playoffs*)
If Kovin wasn't always my roommate I would literally hate him right now 
If KyBock has taught us anything, its that you don't need a job when you're playing the stonks
If Mac Jones or BB get COVID, the league should shut down for a year
If Maine was flooded, I would be there in a heartbeat to help. Just my presence in the state would cause everything to dry up 
If Mama Dr. Bocks was here, she would have a stroke. It basically is a third world country
If manning was on the patriots or if bill was coaching the Broncos? I think those are two different scenarios 
If Marcus has a heart attack, who gets to be the best man
If Marcus hates bama, why did he try and steal Kevin's bama flag for his own use?
If McDaniels goes anywhere, I can see him going there and reuniting with Jason licht
If McDaniels is a head coach somewhere else at that time, I see him going there 
If me beating Ryan leads to that, I will bench my last players if I have to 
If mlk can dream, so can I 
If Morcus didn't want stories about his intimate life getting retold, he joined the wrong GroupMe
If Morcus has Venmo notis turned on for your transactions, that's a power move. Don't hate the player
If Morcus isn't one of the three slackers, I will never say anything bad about him ever again
If Morcus paid as much effort into reading the GroupMe when student loans weren't being forgiven, he wouldn't have left me waiting at DCA 
If more criminals offed themselves, we wouldn't have a prison issue and taxes would go down 
If more people bought discount khakis, there would be more Ross stores, thus more jobs
If my bosses put a timeframe on a project, it's meant for when they will realistically have the time to review it 
If not in here, at least text one of us. Y'all know I've had mental health shit on and off since the end of sophomore year. It sucks. It sucks less when you have people like Bocker texting you from Italy to make sure you're doing ok.
If not tackling was cool, consider the patriots Miles Davis 
If not, I have two half finished handles of captain that I'm happy to bring 
If not, why not
If nothing else, I hope Jerry feels some heat from this. He's a pile of shit with a dis proportioned face 
If one of the two hit, great. If not, you essentially got them for free
If only @bockbot were here. Maybe he would talk to you about baseball, @The Big Dick Bandit 
If only @Skimmer would come home 
If only Adam Gase had a qb like tannehill. Maybe he would not have been fired
If only Darrow and Emyr understand the meme, it should not be used in the groupme
If only everyone in the groupme could respect the idea of a last place punishment 
If only GroupMe allowed you to post about an event, where you could include details like time and have people RSVP. 
If only he could throw and catch the ball 
If only his dad could have had that one pick 
If only I knew earlier and could have changed plans 
If only jboss read the GroupMe
If only my true specialty, identifying typos, wasn't neutered 
If only someone cared enough to maintain the 🐐 list
If only someone had thought to encourage employees to work from home instead of interacting with each other in a close work setting
If only that mattered to some people who run intramural teams
If only the best combination of jersey/helmet in team history hasn't been discovered yet. It would be a real shame to keep overlooking what is obviously the best Patriots uniform to ever exist 
If only the Browns drafted a guy like that. They wouldn’t need 12 QBs on their roster 
If only the chronic bettors in here made a bet groupme like I suggested
If only the Red Sox could have a pitcher like Miller 
If only the vaccine came out a few years ago. Shelbie would have avoided a huge mistake 
If only there was a better option who could actually read and write...(I was part way through this when goody posted his message but I'm sending it anyway) 
If only there was a group chat that we were all in where someone could have thrown the invite out to the group as a whole 
If only there was a GroupMe dedicated to betting
If only there was a national movement to reduce the influence of police on things like substance use and instead invest in social services that could provide referrals to treatment and rehabilitation programs instead of a car ride to jail.
If only there was a state-run website where you could see local testing centers and when they were open 
If only there was a way to shield yourself from the onions 
If only there was another person in this groupme that also needed to drive and lived in your hometown 
If only they had a QB that focused more on playing than endorsement commercials 
If only they had another QB with starting experience
If only Tom Brady could throw AND catch the ball
If only we could do the same thing to you in the groupme 
If only you decided to do this on a weekend where I could attend. I would have brought multiple balls
If only you had a GroupMe to keep track of bets....
If only you had a more competent back up that could win you games, like Drew Lock 
If only you had COVID. You could use your impending death as a reason not to answer the phone
If only you knew one of the Fuckholes who needed a roommate 
If only you showed up to support your friends last night, you could have known the answer.
If only you started Drake
If only you were as passionate about anything in your life as we are about clash
If only you were invited to participate in a trivia event with your fellow Fuckholes on Monday 
If patients can self administer a test without oversight, you can't really track and trace positives 
If pats d goes for less than $25, that's a steal 
If people can’t get the spelling of my name right, despite it being in my email address (Jeffrey.Savarino), I can’t expect people to know everyone else’s desired pronouns 
If people want to pay him money, sure. Keep doing it. But I certainly will be unfollowing him 
If people were allowed to carry assault rifles, they would have shot the two snipers before they opened fire on police, injuring 7 and killing 4 /s
If people were more curious and less judgemental, they would know that I played flag football every Sunday in a bar from age 10 to 16 
If Peyton manning beats Brady next week and then wins the super bowl to walk off into the sunset, I may jump off of the Tobin 
If planes were auto piloted then Sully wouldn't have been able to save all those innocent lives 
If police cannot follow Supreme Court legislation when enacting policing policies, that policy should be banned.
If posting about Pokemon makes me racist, consider me Michael Richards 
If Republicans split from the GOP to form a third party, I would be so happy
If she existed 
If she gets induced today, you'll be free for the weekend
If she gets knocked up, she'll have to focus on someone else other than herself 
If she hasn't stalked us all by now, then denounce
If she likes the men's colors, why doesn't she just buy the men's jacket? 
If she needs a sponge bath, Olivia just got into nursing school so she'll be right over 
If she obtained this money without declaring it on taxes, if she puts it in the bank, she would be liable to pay taxes if she ever got audited on her tax return
If she really wants to go somewhere and doesn't want to wait to see her PCP, Sinai must have an urgent care center. Have her drop in there 
If she served me with an L, why isn't she in the groupme 
If she was guilty based on the evidence, and if the coverup was not adequately proven, then she would have been found guilty….
If she was in the bathroom for 40 minutes, I would be concerned about her bowel health. Now I'm just annoyed 
If so, are you enjoying the nugget porn?
If so, call @The Gargantuan Genetalia Robber 
If so, the rest of us are exempt from the SATs, right? 
If so, this jersey curse has gone too far
If someone is threatening to call hr on you, that bitch needs to lose your number 
If someone offered the Colts a 5th for AR today, they take it in a second. Vikings not doing that with JJ last year
If Sox win in 5, I'll give you tubby time in Stowe
If Ted Cruz had to drop out of the race due to an affair scandal, I would be so happy. 
If that doesn't make you want to vote for Hilldawg, lose my number 
If that doesn't work, I don't know. Ask Bocker in three years 
If that GroupMe existed
If that happens, no chance I don't fly to Mars. I heard it has water on it 
If that isn't a red card and immediate jail time, I don't know what is 
If that makes me an asshole, I will gladly own that title 
If that option is on the table......
If that plan was going to happen under anyone's watch, it would be Bernie's. So vote for Bernie!
If that was true, we'd still be in the climate accords 
If that were the case, that would be very positive
If that’s the case, Joe, you have a severe case of oligospermia 
If that’s the case, then both fast will then target each other so fast will have a 50% chance 
If that’s the case, then his mouth must be gaping right now after he stole a joke from people who are paid a ridiculous amount to not be funny 
If that's a serious answer, that's worse than mine, right? 
If that's fat, I must be obese enough to have a tv show on TLC
If that's how he feels, he can express that on his own time 
If that's not unhinged, I don't know what is 
If that's the way BB wears his mask, I am willing to accept that the pandemic is fake news 
If that's true, that's impressively bad 
If that's what warrants a newspaper writeup...
If the 4th seed plays the right players, the win is just as legitimate as me beating Becker.
If the 9s ever went down....I don't even want to think about what Joe would do
If the Addazio supporters had a cool hashtag like #FireAddazio✌️as their groupme names, maybe I'd have a different opinion 
If the apocalypse strikes, I am loving with Chan
If the ball breaks the plane coming OUT of the endzone, does that still count as a safety?
If the ball had not popped up it probably would have been a catch goody 
If the Browns win by 1 point after a Justin Tucker XP got blocked, I will be so happy 
If the car is locked, why would you put the keys on the dash?
If the case fatality rate is as low as suggested due to all the asymptomatic carriers, than the bigger impact on society would be an oral medication that helps all patients with 'rona. 
If the city of newton can ban gas leaf blowers, every city in the world can too 
If the Democrats filibuster and the republicans change the voting rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement, it could be bad for Dems down the line. If Anthony Kennedy or RBG step down during Trump's presidency, that's two more spots to make the SC very conservative for the next few decades. On the flip side, if those seats aren't open until Dems get the WH back, that's two seats to make the SC more liberal. Could hurt either party depending on how the chips fall 
If the falcons suck this year, it won't be because of this loss. It will be because they lost Kyle Shanahan 
If the falcunts lose this 
If the first link doesn't work
If the Fuckholes cared about anything as much as the Nomar vs. Andrew Jackson debate, racism and global warming would be solved
If the fumble went out of bounds at the 1, the ball would get placed at the 1. If it's 1 yard further, you lose possession. Dumb. I don't care where you spot the ball, but the offense should retain possession 
If the game was in Miami, I think locking up the Pats against a 3-0 team would be ok. At home, very questionable lockup
If the government gets shut down, they can’t tax @Beaner 
If the government would be largely impacted if you were intubated with COVID, you deserve the vaccine 
If the guy who mixes cement for Boston Sand and Gravel doesn't show up to work, the engineer can't build his bridge. Therefore cement mixers are definitely top 3
If the mean and the median are that far apart, then that means there were significant outliers that are skewing the mean. These data should have been reported as median. Bad researchers are bad 
If the NBA shut down tomorrow, I literally wouldn't not care one bit 
If the owners sell the condo, no guarantee that the buyer won't want to a) move in there himself/herself; or b) jack up the rent
If the patriots find a way to establish a run game, you open up the middle of the field because the linebackers are obligated to move up on play action 
If the question was, "will you support measures that limit the scope of the police and thereby decrease the police budget iteratively over the next several years," that feels like a different question
If the raptors don't win this series, I will change my number so you all lose it 
If the second baby exists 
If the shooter today was a straight shooter, his sixty rounds would have injured more than five people 
If the suspension is upheld or a ruling is delayed, Brady is locked out of team facilities on September 5th when the rosters are finalized. However, Brady's lawyers can ask for an injunction allowing him to play until a decision is reached or pending the outcome of an appeal by the NFLA
If the team has an injury and no timeouts, they get an excess time out. But clock is supposed to stop, not run, when play resumes. Like a normal timeout 
If the Titans were the Titoons, I think the Falcons should be the Falcoons
If there are more songs I am supposed to know, I probably don't know thme
If there is a god, he will help me fuck Joe
If there is a way that the NFL could make money, they'd do it 
If there is one thing I’ve learned in med school, tests are option as long as you’ve memorized the Krebs cycle 
If there is one thing that this groupme needs more of, is PoGo talk
If there is some way to share the results so I can shit on whoever has the worst team (probably Joe), that would be great
If there was a living, breathing commissioner, this trade would be vetoed. 
If there wasn't an ems organization, you wouldn't have that picture of me on the floor of conte treating a player 
If there were bigger names, why were they not released when Kraft's name was released 
If these discussions will keep Joe muting the groupme, I wholeheartedly endorse them 
If they accept it, it goes back to first down and time is wasted on the clock. Accepting it means a down is loss 
If they are into cocktails, Apres
If they are too shitty to get playing time for the soccer team, you don't want them kicking footballs on a Saturday afternoon 
If they aren't in the GroupMe, then they don't exist 
If they can't say no then they can't turn you down Joseph. I hear merkert has some chloroform 
If they didn't blow the play dead, it would have been a touchdown 
If they do, I'm fine with it if his family is 
If they don't go for it, shanahan deserves to be fired on the spot 
If they even think about booting Darrow, I'm rioting 
If they had stopped to help him, I wouldn't feel the need to be hyperbolic. But they let him bleed out of his ear as they stepped over his body. 
If they have, that'd be major key. It's been close to a year since I went in and asked 
If they just rename their team every year, it will be a first for everything 
If they scored, Becker would have lost points, but they called turnover on downs 
If they walk in, yes. If they come by ambulance, obviously bypass the front desk so it’s only the nurse 
If they were both that good, wouldn't they have declared for the WWE draft after their second year 
If they were down by 2 and he took that shot, then we are talking about his huge balls
If they're only getting 65% reimbursement for each procedure, they're going to raise their rates to compensate for the 35% they are losing. So patients end up paying more out of pocket 
If this actually goes to court, the judge said it could take 2 years 
If this baby, if it existed, isn't born on my birthday, I'm gonna be pissed 
If this celebration is in Goody's honor, then I can't make it 
If this groupme were any colder rn, it would be 0 degrees kolvin. Get it, it’s like kelvin and Kovin our together?! 
If this is what you've become after being dumped by a chick after her sweet sixteen.....yikes
If this message stays pinned until 5/1/24 without interruption, I will let Bocker into the Salon 
If this season was analogous to goody's sex life, though, goody would have finished by week 3
If this was discussed last night, yes I skimmed everything related to basketball 
If this was football, they would play through it 
If this was the NBA HoF, he would be in 
If this were Covid, most doctors around here are recommending not going to a clinic or hospital unless you start having shortness of breath or uncontrollable fevers. For a temp < 100.4, my rec is to stay at home and which way it presents. Either you get better on your on own or you start feeling worse. Most hospitals have covid hotlines that you can call ahead of time
If this were not the super bowl, I want you to know that I would remove you from this group chan 
If this were the Chargers, everyone in this GroupMe would be blaming Herbert, who never deserves any blame ever 
If those stores existed
If times square went up in flames, the world would be better off 
If Tom coughlin still hates the giants like he says he does, he should come work for BB
If took you two days to copy a speech?
If trump dies, do the Republicans get to nominate someone else? 
If trump doesn't get the nomination in a brokered convention but has more delegates, can he sue the RNC?
If Trump loses, I wonder what happens to the Rs that sold out for him
If trump wants to save his career, he needs to hire Ted Wells and Jeff Pash to lead an independent investigation into these allegations. 
If we are doing this for fun, then I feel like we can probably trust everyone to use the honor system
If we are not talked at that point, easy win. If we are ranked by then, we lose by 24
If we are talking about mental height, then their team must have been very short
If we are, just let me know and I can create the meeting
If we can't decide on a clear posa candidate, I vote we cancel the posa til next year 
If we do, it will only be after something catastrophic happens
If we don't fumble against the Bills, and if we don't blow coverage in OT against Dallas, we are 11-2 right now. A couple better executed plays on O and D against the Buccs and we are 12-1. If we replay the whole game against the saints, we are 13-0. 
If we don't shoot this video tonight, I may go jump off of the Tobin. Indeed this to happen 
If we go top 4, Bocker and I match 3/4. That's pretty damn good
If we had a commissioner like Darrowball, the colluders would be punished

IIRC, we get the stars announced in like 2 weeks? Does that sound right?
IIRC, we were all pissed because Jordan was up big and then goody came back during the course of the game and took the lead, and it was looking like goody was going to win 
IIRC, you got there late 
I'll accept that deal right when you send me the winnings for the survival pool
I'll actually ask her if you're serious, but i can't guarantee anything 
I'll advised throw by Brady there. 
I'll agree to attend if Kristen proves in writing that she is happily willing to shoulder the burden of my dietary requirements
I'll allow it
I'll also be busy 
I'll also bring wine
I'll always have the moment her and I shRed together 
I'll answer if I god damn want to answer. 4-6 times per week. 5 on average. 
I'll answer that question as soon as I get my photoshop from Chan
I'll answer that question at the end of this season. As awful as BCI is, they're very high on this year's baseball team. Let's see what they can do
I'll assume that you mistook me for Becker and your comment was a mistake 
I'll be asleep by 830n
I'll be at work til 11 so if you have any concerns or things to work out I won't be able to communicate til then 
I'll be away next weekend but I am not sure I can be there tomorrow either. So my vote is to not vote.

I'll be dead before that happens. 
I'll be going as far as possible from you fucks during Thanksgiving 
I'll be home tonight
I'll be in Boston, not sure about what in doing. Friends from home are trying to go to some event at a hotel in Boston but I haven't heard much more about it

I'll be in your homestate

I'll be on the Tobin if any of you need me 
Ill be over with weed for Frank and benzos for Ricky 
I'll be shocked if the Celtics don't get the 6th pick because that's what I've been conditioned to expect 
I'll be sitting on my couch being a fat shit. That excludes me from doing anything social or productive all day. 
I'll be sure to ask
I'll be taking a job full time to proofread all of this Groupme's posts 
I'll be the guy wearing warmup sweats who gets your rebounds and passes you balls during warm ups

I'll be your Jonah Ryan
I'll bet a dollar 
I'll bet that if you're right, you and I will go on a romantic spaghetti dinner date and split the check at the end 
I'll bring it as long as I can finish cooking it in chan's oven 
I'll bring them to Davios. I'll be in the back with my hand up
I'll buy the second ticket and rip it up in front of the rest of the Swifties 
I'll care
I'll come
I'll crack some skulls and make it happen
I'll defer to Bocker and Kovin, seeing as they are actual doctors, but I probably would just keep doing what you're doing. It doesn't look that worrisome to me. 
I'll do it for you 
I'll do my best 
I'll employ @Professor Of Asstronomy to spy on Morcus's bathing habits. He's over there visiting with his family often enough
I'll enjoy the last two hours and 38 minutes that I don't have to show and semblance of happiness for Joseph 
I'll enjoy watching you get diabetes 
I'll explain it to you when you decide to get to work 
I'll forge through
I'll get around to it in a year or 5 
I'll get back to you next week
I'll get paid either way. His fault for leaving and not giving me work to do during our agreed upon start week 
I'll get there at like 6:45
I'll give it to you for $200
I'll give Nick the benefit of the doubt considering he's ending conflict in the Middle East or something like that

I'll give you $5. Not a penny more

I'll go back to not being called for this conference that ends in 10 minutes. Carry on
I'll go one month more conservative than bocker. September 1st 
I'll go through streaks of drinking coffee daily for a week and then won't have any for a couple weeks 
I'll grab some stuff for dip if people want to bring chips. I don't have much else snacky stuff so any snacks you'd like. And if you want beers (@Jamie Bourque), I will not have those 
I'll have time to fortnight right after I beat TotK
I'll have to record that in the case files 
I'll have you know that I just circled weeks 9 and 12 on my league calendar
I'll have you know that my balls are so big, I stood up to a black girl who posted on a link I shared on facebook about the ferguson protests. It takes huge balls to argue over the Internet 
I'll head over whenever chan wants us over. 
I'll hire you if you get fired. I don't drug test. 
I'll hire you Jordan. We don't drug test 
I'll just eat tacos alone 
I'll just need $1000 from everyone 
I'll just respond by cutting him out of my life 
I'll keep my eyes and ears open 
I'll keep talking to myself. The police chief in Atlanta stepped down after another shooting/killing of a black man. The mayor also has requested that the officer involved me fired

I'll know by week 4 the truth about std's
I'll leave it to your imagination

I'll look at your roster tonight and send you a trade request if I see anything I like 
I'll make it for you bae 
I'll make one of the interns do it. In the hallway. 
I'll meet you at my new place at 11 pm and we can keep unpacking 
I'll never facilitate a ticket sale to a non-patriots fan. 
I'll pass along our wish for a new AD and good football program 
I'll personally pass 
I'll pick the latter if in this scenario, Bocker has to work all of my ED shifts for the month while I train 
I'll pick tonight after work 
I'll plan to eat before I come over then. I would never trust anything you cooked 
I'll post what I sent to this kid 
I'll probably be in Stowe that weekend 
I'll probably be over
I'll promise you free healthcare for life if you pay off my loans instead
I'll refer that question to our league historian, @Sultan of Stamford 
I'll refrain from engaging in any conversation about this at this time 
I'll respect them, but I won't like them 
I'll run with you in Boston 
I'll sacrifice myself if we need to get to 8, if we're still doing the SAT thing as punishment 
I'll save it for the Banff GroupMe so I don't upset the sheeple

I'm 2-2 Chan. Thanks for asking

I'm 50/50 is a very helpful phrase when discussing reservations

I'm a believe in a different rating system for teachers. I feel like someone who is a 6 in the real life might be like an 8 or 9 on the teacher hotness scale. Or maybe I was just a perverted high schooler  
I'm a big "stop killing chickens with bird flu" supporter. They get 12% of my income annually 
I'm a big basketball fan. And I love sports betting
I'm a big champion guy myself 
I'm a big fan of Marc's George Washington rant though. 
I'm a big fan of MoreHead. I hope he pushes himself in there 
I'm a big fan of the Valve games. I don't know if anyone has played the counter strike games, or team fortress, or half life/half life 2, but they're all quite good

I'm a huge fan of the bioshock series, but can definitely understand why someone wouldn't like the gameplay 
I'm a huge fan of tits 
I'm a little confused as to why I wasn't invited on whatever this lovers trip Blocker and Morcus planned 
I'm a little tired today, didn't get to sleep until late. But other than that, doing well.
I'm a little torn on the OL. Andrews is definitely the clear choice for C. Mankins played 4 seasons in this decade, so he definitely qualifies for a spot at OG. I think Thuney has been more solid than Mason but Mason started one more seasons and is a mauler in the run game; although Mason has had some injuries and a down year. For the tackles, Solder is probably the clear #1 tackle, but I think I put Cannon over Vollmer?
I'm a little*
I'm a long shit guy. I like catching up on twitter or groupme and avoiding spending time with Bocker in the office 
I'm a moderate fan. I probably would not have gone had Olivia not been a very big fan. I was really only there for my girl Maggie Rogers 
I'm a new member of the MGH HAZMAT response team. Today was our first training 
I'm a no.

I'm a pretty shitty skier, so I'd die if I ever went into a glade, but do any of you guys ski backcountry? There's a pretty famous/infamous spot at Stowe called the Kitchen Wall. I need someone to ski it and take a video so I can live vicariously through them 
I'm a sheep. I'll do whatever everyone else does 
I'm a wine drunk. Gutta post those wine Covid memes
I'm about to get heat stroke 
I'm about to pop over to the stonks GroupMe to discuss action for this week
I'm absolutely appalled that three people are so stupid that they think skittles are good
I'm actually a big fan of Nikki in that song. Yeezy was good too 
I'm actually a niners fan tho
I'm actually already well read on that article
I'm actually attending a virtual cocktail class that my friends Simon and Kerri are also attending 
I'm actually bettering myself intellectually. But thanks for the concern 
I'm actually curious to hear @The Awbarn Bandwagoner chime in 
I'm actually elated 
I'm actually fully on board with the Patriots finding a way to trade up for Haskins the more I think about it. If BB can rip off a team like the Raiders ripped off the Steelers, I would fully support the move.
I'm actually in if its only &5
I'm actually more impressed because you were probably in work clothes and had a bag, plus you had real consequences if you failed 
I'm actually on days. I woke up because I am 12 days into what was probably Covid and woke up coughing up a storm 
I'm actually planning on it. But I'm going to continue to just troll right now. 
I'm actually really surprised by the aversion for BC players that the Pats have. Maybe they just think we're not coached well enough, but I figured since scouts had such easy access to the team, we might have one or two dudes, even on the PS 
I'm actually watching live today 
I'm admittedly biased by my liberal views but netenyahu (spelling, probably butchered it) and Trump are buddy buddy and Trump wants to pull out of the deal. What is the relevance of Intel from a several years ago and why was it released now and not back then if it was truly a big deal? 
I'm afraid that I might give something away by providing my rankings. I just don't want to disappoint anyone 
I'm afraid that some members of the GroupMe would tar and feather you for such a transgression. Shame that we can't hold everyone to the same high morals that you are exhibiting
I'm afraid that we've lost @Boe Jourque  forever
I'm all about the Alabama and Auburn players who are mask shaming people going to bars around their campuses 
I'm all about the Browns making the playoffs. They aren't eliminated after that Steelers win, right?
I'm all for dropping basketball for lacrosse 
I'm all for kids who have bone cancer, just not that kid 
I'm all for vice taxes. If I'm going to treat my body like shit, I should contribute more towards the costs of my eventually necessary healthcare 
I'm all in on carrier pigeons now 
I'm all in on Darrow
I'm all in on making sloppy joes soon 
I'm all in on Morocco. Their goalie is a thug
I'm all in on the ex-Pats Wolfpack

I'm allergic to dairy you insensitive fuck 
I'm almost as happy as I was when Andrew Jackson beat Nomar

I'm already disinterested. Let me know when things start blowing up 
I'm already in bed. So super happy
I'm already in the league 
I'm already on that list, but please keep nominating me so I get a higher seed 
I'm already there
I'm also a fat fuck 
I'm also a huge BJ fan 
I'm also a maybe
I'm also back at work
I'm also confused how Lou Wilson fits into all of this 
I'm also down for 5. Looks cheaper and just as fun
I'm also down for doing this dinner any night of the week, and we'd have an easier time getting a reservation, if that works for others 
I'm also getting dinner right near the bar. We should have gotten dinner together!!!
I'm also heading smoke about Wa Shin
I'm also in favor of a non-monetary punishment that wouldn't be considered a violation of my institution's strict personal conduct policy
I'm also interviewing for medical education chief resident...
I'm also late to the party about the last death, but apparently it was a guy who had a heart attack after accidentally tasing himself 
I'm also leaving to start my own separate league by myself. I predict second place 
I'm also not a fan of taking a RB in the first round
I'm also not a huge PayPal fan, but I just don't find their service useful. Also, I agree with John. Not a fan of venmo either, I use Cash which is produce by Square. Money transfers directly into your bank account instantly and I don't have to look at a pseudo social media site with everyone's payments every time I log in 
I'm also not here
I'm also out. 
I'm also preferential to staying in/near Boston. I sympathize with Becker's feelings on going out 
I'm also projecting the Pats to pick a linebacker and safety that no one has heard of
I'm also seeing that Pence is the reason why the national guard got mobilized. Trump was trying to stop it from happening 
I'm also surprised that measure didn't pass. I didn't look at the state-wide results, but Somerville was 75% no 
I'm always down for more Fuckholes 
I'm always down to jerk

I'm answering Johnny Dash's question because he asked it then disappeared 
I'm anti redundancy 
I'm anti you 
I'm around
I'm around if you come to Maine 
I'm around tonight, but not around tomorrow. My friend from home just got an apartment and is throwing a housewarming party thing. If plans fall through with that, I will let you know 
I'm assuming Gordon is gunna be out a few weeks. 
I'm assuming it's because I didn't lie about my income/expenses so I didn't look very favorable
I'm assuming it's not the knifeblade because that would be too easy for someone to guess if they don't actually know how to do it 
I'm assuming it's quality of care (as measured by certain outcome measures like life span) relative to per capita cost
I'm assuming that most of these areas have already established taxi companies offer service 
I'm at #5 and no "straight to the final four with ya" 
I'm at an 8.  Slightly less than the Seahawks super bowl, but still high. 
I'm at the airport 2.5 hours before my flight and already through security. My day is ruined 
I'm at the buffet with my hand up
I'm at the Fogo in Providence. I assume that's what you meant
I'm at work and just got a notification about Davante. So I came here to post about it, but I did not skim, so I know that it has already been mentioned. 
I'm at work, don't get me too erect 
I'm at work. Can someone tell me about the status of the fix? 
I'm at work. Didn't read above
I'm at work. Huge fomo 
I'm at work. Why aren't we winning 
I'm avoiding picking the same team as Kovin and JBoss. I'm no sheep.
I'm awake now because the grind doesn't stop with a new puppy
I'm aware. Better than taking the SATs
I'm back in an endless torrent of pain and hopelessness
I'm back on team Kristen. He's ducking
I'm back to days 
I'm back to not caring about basketball. Let's not talk about it 
I'm basically as successful as Maz
I'm basing what I said off of one random tweet. I don't have that info goody
I'm beating my expectations for myself. Sets me up perfectly to be heartbroken when I lose on Monday night somehow 
I'm behind a few episodes. I keep them saved up to listen to when I fly. 
I'm being asked to clarify "steak, not beef" 
I'm being trashed like Theo Epstein when he left the Red Sox
I'm better than Marcus! 
I'm betting on Trump and his whole administration being impeached before then 
I'm betting that I am in spot #8
I'm biased but I think you should all move to Davis square 
I'm big sad
I'm body shaming myself, not Marcus
I'm bored 
I'm bored. The answer is Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama
I'm bringing cocaine for Mrs. Bocker and hookers for Goody
I'm building something bigger from the ground up
I'm busy saving lives 
I'm busy throwing my hands up in the airo saying ayo 
I'm busy. Still applying to grad school. 
I'm buying for two people, but I spend ~$100-$125/week total on groceries
I'm celebrating regardless 
I'm channeling my inner Marcus 
I'm chubby? 
I'm claiming to be the ward 3 alderman of pound town. I recognize the real mayor, Dr. Darrow
I'm comanager with you 
I'm coming back from Vermont on Sunday so I won't be around, but thank you for the invite Chan 
I'm coming for you Joe
I'm concerned about injuries during the 8/29 games. Can we agree that if a keeper gets injured during the final game, the manager has a right to un-keep them? 
I'm concerned by the lack of Italian prostitutes in season 3
I'm concerned for you good 
I'm concerned that @Skimmer may still be looking for parking 
I'm concerned that he may be dead. Someone should text him 
I'm conflicted because I never want a player to get hurt, but I fucking hate goody so much. 
I'm conflicted. Everyone loves Tiger King, so obviously I have to hate it. Do I have to hate seasons 1-6 and then love seasons 7 and 8 of GoT?
I'm conflicted. I want bc to win but I don't want Marcus to win money
I'm conflicted. This clearly violates the present value rule because Doug Martin is trash despite him being the lead back with Marshawn out. However, $15 draft dollars is a lot and would help hamstring Emyr next year. He's banking on all his keepers but it's going to backfire
I'm confused as to why this was played at a party. Were people just sitting in each room jerking it? 
I'm confused at what we are arguing about. So I guess by my logic, Becker wins 
I'm confused by Denver gets to have different helmets for tonight's game 
I'm confused how all these packages got sent to incorrect addresses when y'all put down your preferred address
I'm confused how she doesn't know if she paid for the ring since she provides all your income
I'm confused how you know it was humorous if it's impossible to watch videos in the GroupMe 
I'm confused why anyone is watching anything but the Pats 
I'm confused why chan is defending the patriots. This doesn't make sense 
I'm confused why JJ watt didn't win 
I'm confused, I am at Davio's waiting
I'm confused. Complicated pattern or no complicated pattern
I'm confused. I only had one roommate named Kovin
I'm confused. I went to bed at halftime when Bo was dealing. I assume the fix must have been in HARD 
I'm confused. Is UNC supposed to be good? The whole team looks like trash. Why are we worrying? 
I'm confused. Jordan, didn't you say that you collectively decided that Chan's was a better option? Wasn't Becker with you last night? 
I'm confused. Kovin has not shown me support recentky>
I'm confused. There is still a 0 next to the Bruins name on the telecast 
I'm convinced that since we have no depth on defense, we're just going to keep all of our offensive players
I'm convinced. Baker for lyfe. 
I'm convinced. I vote goatbbert
I'm cool with four as long as that's cool with darrow and Chan and whoever else wants to come 
I'm curious how you have the money to go to Norway, Ireland/Scotland, etc. I know my job pays next to nothing, but I don't see any of the other business folk in the groupme traveling the world 
I'm curious if anyone else thinks KC is making a mistake going with Mahomes
I'm curious to know @JustFacts✅'s honest opinion on this man, as they did their MBS program together 
I'm curious who the intended audience of that post is 
I'm curious. Has anyone seen the fix today? 
I'm currently 100% dependent on the government in young age. Can't see how it would be much worse as an elder
I'm currently asleep. Goodnight
I'm currently pulling out of Bologna on my way to Venice, it is 92F out, and my train car is the only one without air conditioning 
I'm cute as fuck 
I'm debating it. He's a baddie tryhard
I'm definitely in the top 5 
I'm definitely not bitter
I'm definitely pro-dissolving the US. We don't need all these states 
I'm definitely somewhere in the top 12 
I'm disappointed that this tasting menu isn't occurring at DCA at 9 am 
I'm disappointed that you would dare call me ignorant on a subject on which I am extremely passionate: banking regulations.
I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. How is your day, Christopher?
I'm doing it 
I'm doing the same with Joe's family, sorry
I'm doing well, thanks.
I'm done going to the gym 
I'm down 
I'm down for a weight in 
I'm down for dinner this weekend but only if Emyr is there 
I'm down for some Catan 
I'm down for Vikings or raiders 
I'm down if we start after April 19th
I'm down to Zoom 
I'm eating cheese. Basically same thing
I'm embarrassed to say that I just watched die hard for the first time 
I'm entering Stamvegas bby
I'm Eric 
I'm excited for it to just get better 
I'm excited that some thing good is going to happen. Just saw the face ask 
I'm excited to see @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 's reaction to goody's take 
I'm explaining it to the group 
I'm fighting through a broken heart too. Don't know what everyone else's excuse is 
I'm figuratively shitting my pants right now with this matchup against jordances with wolves 
I'm finding that there are too many days during the week where I don't have a new ATN podcast to listen to 
I'm fine for chan joining the league without risk of having to take the SATs. I still would like to revisit the conversation for removing that as a punishment altogether, since now we've lost one league member due to the punishment and his replacement is exempt from it 
I'm fine with grabbing dinner. I'm also happy to grill up some burgers and 'dogs for y'all on Saturday. 
I'm fine with him doing that 
I'm fine with it 
I'm fine with that 
I'm fine with that. Keep finding late round talent that fits your offensive system and invest your early picks on the side of the ball that needs it 
I'm firmly against playoffs. Everyone should feel included and thus we should be giving out participation trophies to everyone. 
I'm firmly on #TeamBock
I'm flattered that you all are stalking my social media posts 
I'm flying Delta from now on 
I'm focused 
I'm for choosing the niners. 
I'm for the presence of planned parenthood because they provide services that aren't offered in many communities. I think they should be operated just like regular doctors offices. They provide medical treatment/tests and insurance should reimburse (or more likely, deny the claim and force the payer to cover the cost out of pocket)
I'm fucked aren't I? 
I'm fucked. I can't watch anymore. I'm going to bed. Congrats Darrow. Bocker, go fuck yourself. 
I'm fucking in class right now. 
I'm fully supportive of another night of Catan but won't be around until 9ish 
I'm getting a court order for joe to hand the money over, it will all work out ok. 
I'm getting frank for Christmas 
Im getting increasingly concerned that you don’t know what a bathroom is 
I'm getting lunch at loco in an hour 
I'm getting reports that the whole campus is on fire. Cannot confirm or deny
I'm getting the sense that Morcus does not like Jayson Tatum
I'm getting thrown Ls all day today. I get to our hotel and they didn't have the room I reserved in stock 
I'm glad all four of us will enjoy the Fuckhole ski trip 
I'm glad Emyr split the pot. Just for his kindness, I am willing to renegotiate PPR scoring. 
I'm glad everyone is interested in talking about basketball when I'm actually watching the game 
I'm glad he has standards about which weddings he takes his shirt off at
I'm glad I allow the real you to come out (pun intended)
I'm glad I could rely on my good friend @Joe Bourque to throw me a like for the Bobby Valentine reference 
I'm glad I got the other ones because I don't think that I would have gotten purple 
I'm glad I joined your team after week 1
I'm glad I left for work and didn't see BC lose 
I'm glad I was converted 
I'm glad I won the 3 way head to head championship 
I'm glad I'm not watching this game because watching it may have actually destroyed my love for football once and for all. This seems like one of the most boring games of all time 
I'm glad James Gallo raped himself by paying so much for Aaron Jones 
I'm glad joe didn't move in with me. Can't support that privileged attitude 
I'm glad Jordan is back to taking some L's. I was feeling real bad about myself for a bit there 
I'm glad my decision against drafting AJ Green was finally vindicated in week 11
I'm glad our police officers are armed and can stop terrorists before they can kill people 
I'm glad Sterling Shepard and Brandin Cooks are playing well. 
I'm glad that @Boe Jourque is still alive
I'm glad that @Chank Hill upgraded and is now sharing his Insta feed instead of his Twitter feed 
I'm glad that all answers leave @Chaniel Craig's team off of the list
I'm glad that endorsing chicken fucking is all that needs to happen for Goody to actually vote for a candidate. 
I'm glad that even though we disagreed on the basics, we can still compromise and agree that Joe sucks 
I'm glad that in your hypothetical situation, it would take the immigrant a long time to find "Sommerville"
I'm glad that Jordan stands against domestic terrorism but finds domestic abuse funny 
I'm glad that playoff baseball at least has competitive games that attract fans both young and old 
I'm glad that Tevin Coleman just poached that touchdown from Freeman because fuck Kovin
I'm glad that you finally acknowledge the transgressions of bikers 
I'm glad that you made it on the plane this time 
I'm glad to be someone's favorite Fuckhole 
I'm glad we all have different preferences so we don't fight over the same women. Except Darrow just steals everyone's gurl
I'm glad we have similar tastes, otherwise you spooning me would be more awkward than it already is 
I'm glad we put this whole tannehill issue behind us. Jamie, you're right. He belongs on your team. 
I'm glad we stopped talking about ISIS in order to talk about the real issues in today's world 
I'm glad you agree
I'm glad you agree with me 
I'm glad you all think so highly of me 
I'm glad you are groveling at my feet again and acknowledging my championships by giving me likes. 
I'm glad you are still alive after Shelbs eviscerated you
I'm glad you corrected your mistake. I thought you had turned into a bitch for a minute there 
I'm glad you didn't become a statistic of gang violence in Detroit 
I'm glad you didn't. That would have been a bad look 
I'm glad you guys decided to go still 
I'm glad you took the time to do that math, but I was just perpetuating the running Fuckhole joke that Jdawgs is a bandwagon fan 
I'm glad you were always my friend
I'm glad you weren't off the interview list 
I'm glad your paper is on trial 
I'm going a rural emergency medicine rotation at Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor and the hospital is paying for my housing there. I'm currently on a plane en route to s conference in Austin
I'm going back to bed
I'm going for Dough Man, Doughboy's estranged, stomach-jiggling father 
I'm going for the season low score this week 
I'm going into class now, I end my argument here. Nick can take over 
I'm going into emergency medicine. If people stopped coming to the ED when they didn't have emergencies, I would be so happy
I'm going to be busy getting a lobotomy. I'd reschedule but hanging out with you seems more unpleasant 
I'm going to be cramming for my impossible exam on Friday 
I'm going to be last, aren't I? 
I'm going to be sick 
I'm going to be so happy when the Packers collapse 
I'm going to be unstoppable this week. Starting a jets receiver, a bears receiver, and a backup running back. 
I'm going to be up this morning because birthday cake 
I'm going to bid 36 dollars on everyone just to spite Becker 
I'm going to bring Darrow with me as a weapon 
I'm going to burn a bunch of excel documents in front of joe and see how he reacts. Stress interview 
I'm going to bust 
I'm going to come back to the "gave you a whole bag of candy" thing 
I'm going to disappear back into the shadows and keep playing on my own now since Angela doesn't want me in the CoC clan
I'm going to eat leftover turkey? 
I'm going to eat leftovers at home while I study 
I'm going to exercise my right to not vote and then complain about who everyone else elects on social media 
I'm going to exit the company wifi before anyone starts sending pictures and I get fired 
I'm going to feel bad for Shelbie when she realizes he lacks commitment to people who supposedly mean something to him
I'm going to get mine next week 
I'm going to go ahead and say that I did that ironically 
I'm going to go kill myself 
I'm going to go off myself
I'm going to go with blind homer. It's seemed to work for me thus far. 
I'm going to go with what's written on the top of that player. Betamax
I'm going to guess something in Africa and something in Asia 
I'm going to guess that you googled it 
I'm going to have nightmares of having to watch Rozier miss 100% of threes he shot 
I'm going to hazard a guess that she's the punta 2 pizza girl 
I'm going to hire an Asian man to follow you around all day and make phone calls from outside your stall door when you try and take a shit. Chan, you available?
I'm going to ignore the 20 years of happiness he brought me while he was perpetually underpaid 
I'm going to invite Kristen and Ricky. I hope they come and leave you home 
I'm going to keep pointing it out as I keep realizing how mad it makes e
I'm going to keep rambling until GroupMe gets lit again
I'm going to look like a jackass if the guy I recommended for an internship gets all of MGH hacked 
I'm going to lose to Kovin this week, aren't I? 
I'm going to lose, aren't I 
I'm going to no weddingd
I'm going to pretend that Joe wasn't a dick and gave me the right answer. Thanks Joe! 
I'm going to put this enthralling discussion on hold and direct everyone to Tom Brady's most recent Facebook post 
I'm going to rank Brown at least #2
I'm going to refrain from commenting on this question out of fear that Becker will twist my words and hold them over my head 
I'm going to say somewhere between 10.9 and 11.6. But either way still significantly less than 12.5
I'm going to say that I'm out on brunch but 100% in on dinner 
I'm going to sleep before the game is over. Please text me now separately from the GroupMe 
"I'm going to take a stab with no background information or expertise. Jordan, critique my take. 

By further destabilizing Iran through increased terrorist action, ISIS can create more of a power vacuum through which to gain an increased footing. "
I'm going to the Sox game. May swing by if it gets over early 
I'm going to trust the Intuit website until the CFA in the group tells me otherwise
I'm going to write about strategies to minimize surprise medical bills during emergency care, thanks guys.
I'm gone for two days and you shut down the whole IS system 
I'm gonna make my own power rankings, with blackjack and hookers 
I'm gonna pull a joff tonight, if you catch my drift @#JustFacts✅ 
I'm good on food - I'll figure it out, maybe run to whole foods at halftime. Is it ok if Olivia comes? 
I'm good to play whenever
I'm good, thanks for asking
I'm grading essays written by students who are in school for a degree higher than the one I currently have. And they're atrocious. I guess I took my Melrose high and BC education for granted. 
I'm great at fake golf 
I'm great. Moonlit last night. Couldn't fall asleep. Have a paper and a presentation to write up today. Going to be lit 
I'm great. Thanks for asking. How are you? 
Im guess I’m just used to darrow always being over here 
I'm guessing he's not coming to return punts for us
I'm guessing like 97% chance it happens
I'm gunna call my good friend Lynn Von Trapp, who owns/runs the whole Trapp complex and have her get Joe arrested
I'm gunna call now. Will report how it goes.
I'm gunna go boy
I'm gunna like it, but it's rough
IM GUNNA LOCK IT UP 
I'm gunna lose to Kovin this week
I'm gunna need that tac shaver. What an infomercial 
I'm hanging out at 164 Summit Ave Providence RI from 3pm to midnight every day from 12/23 to 12/27. See you there 
I'm happily making money sitting in the back of an ambulance while I blissfully ignore that this game is occurring 
I'm happy about that
I'm happy eating at the taco place right across the street before 8 and then meeting you guys at 8 
I'm happy for @bockbot. He'd be devastated if Covid destroyed your lungs and he couldn't hear you sing anymore 
I'm happy for BoChangles Nix 
I'm happy for him to answer that way when he's right. But he's wrong, so stop whining like a bitch 
I'm happy John found somewhere he could go where he finally felt safe to be himself.
I'm happy Morcus left when we started talking about the game 
I'm happy simply to not give you the satisfaction. Also, if you don't have that picture saved on your phone by now, lose my number. 
I'm happy that he finally helped the browns 
I'm happy that Joe paid to see this game live. 
I'm happy to have people over with the caveat that I don't have HD. I know for some that's a deal breaker so I don't care if we go somewhere else too 
I'm happy to see that the Bills have developed the technology to bring back someone from the dead. I thought for sure that Josh Norman was never coming back 
I'm happy you got off the Corey Davis train finally. I told you when you drafted him that it's a rough ride, emotionally 
I'm having a great time, thanks for asking. I am enjoying avoiding downtown LA at all costs 
I'm having a stroke
I'm having trouble finding something to eat 
I'm headed to SOWA with Olivia 
I'm heading there this evening 
I'm hearing 4.5 for 1 year. I don't know how much of that is incentives 
I'm hearing from multiple well-placed sources that Josh Jackson is the most athletic player in the draft and can make a huge impact as a wing scorer. GMs are falling in love with him late in the draft 
I'm hearing some chatter that Andy Isabella, WR from Umass has some Pats interest. Been working out with Randy Moss
I'm hearing some real hot takes that Observation Point is less crowded, less dangerous, and has a better view than Angel's Landing
I'm helping w/ a curriculum planning committee so they made me an account
I'm here
I'm here bby
I'm here for you
I'm here now. Gronk is gone :(
I'm holding a bucket of gauze right now. So no
I'm home btw, in case anyone was concerned 
I'm home Jordan, but thanks for the invitation. 
I'm honestly surprised that nothing came out of the "bills are having headset issues" during their 2 minute drill in the 4th 
I'm honestly surprised you guys still have brain cells after following him for so long
I'm honored to be part of that group
I'm honored to have my name associated with a sexual act that lovers perform to bring pleasure to their partners in intimacy
I'm hoping for a repeat of the super bowl two years ago 
I'm hoping that there was another reason, like Cam requesting release after not being named starter, for why they released him
I'm hoping to catch the end of that boiz trip to Austin
I'm ignoring @Skimmer's second post 
I'm ignoring that and listing backups. 
I'm ignoring that I mentioned cardiology because it doesn't fit my narrative 
I'm in
I'm in class, so I kind of don't know what's going on haha
I'm in class. Can I get updates when people score
I'm in favor of deciding the number of delegates each state has by the average iq of the state 
I'm in favor of going back to a yahoo snake league with kickers; no keepers, and ppr 
I'm in for no buy in and no punishment. Actually, there should be no places. We all should split points evenly so we are all equal.
I'm in hell every day, my friend 
I'm in last?
I'm in line outside the mandarin oriental 
I'm in line to get my brain tickled 
I'm in Somerville so I doubt that 
I'm in Stowe you asshat. If anyone didn't invite you, it was Olivia 
I'm in the back of the bleacher seats with my hand up
I'm in the Micu in July. I don't have my schedule yet. I would go if I had the day off and could afford the ticket and travel, but unfortunately I am a poor 
I'm in the middle of a break in a practice exam. Can someone quickly tell me the dates of the reuinion 
I'm in the middle of a forced wellness lecture. I've never felt more unwell
I'm in your school now. How do you feel. 
I'm in. 
I'm in. I'll make the reservation today if we can get a final count of who can go 
I'm incredibly active 
I'm insulted
I'm interpreting that study to mean that there is an 88% chance that either Kovin or John has Coeliac's
I'm interviewing tufts applicants in 5 minutes. I hope they have some good insight into the impending global crustacean wars
I'm into international lacrosse now
I'm irrationally mad and this is unacceptable 
I'm jealous of Joe because he doesn't always have to always be your friend
I'm Joff
I'm joff 
I'm Joff 
I'm Joff but I am also #JustFacts
I'm joining that gym next year too. I'll finally have unlimited visits 
I'm just asking the question
I'm just assuming
I'm just coming in to throw in some likes. That's my contribution 
I'm just copying my bestest friend in the whole world
I'm just doing my part to reduce Chinese overpopulation 
I'm just glad that my @Chancy Reagan, @Female Body Inspector Agent #69, @Skimmer chat doesn't get leaked 
I'm just glad that the outcome was that the rope had been there for years. Last thing we needed was another Jussie Smollet (spelling?) incident where it turned out that he planted it 
I'm just glad that we cleared the path for Bailey Zappe to take over with a competition at QB
I'm just going by the recent reporting that Cohen accepted money from companies for access to the president. 
I'm just going with whatever Joe says, as previously established
I'm just happy BoChangles Nix got out in time 
I'm just happy that bc is starting a new chapter
I'm just happy that my childhood team has found so much success 
I'm just happy to be with my good friend Bock 
I'm just happy to have competence back on the defense given how much it regressed last year. We now have a stable RT and the right side of the line is passable at this point. Need help on the left side, maybe another safety, and a field stretching receiver 
I'm just have to smoke you clowns on the bball court
I'm just here to hear about how Kirk threw for 400 yards and 5 tuddies while playing against an awful team down their best defensive player
I'm just making sure the rest of the GroupMe has access to your content.
I'm just not used to girls paying attention to me 
I'm just reading now that the second half of the Pats game got cancelled because Mac Jones went missing? I hope he is okay
I'm just reporting what the people want 
I'm just saying, kovin making career decisions off of some study published by the "American medical association" is pretty inappropriate. Am I choosing to ignore that he also didn't like his time in vascular surgery? Your damn right I am 
I'm just saying, the reports were that he wanted $8m+/year. Maybe Pats were willing to give him $6m but only for two years 
I'm just so happy that that wasn't sarcasm. No way Joe would skip out on his "friends" 
I'm just so thankful that this GroupMe has real American heroes, like @#Just📠✅, who are committed to fighting tyranny and oppression. 
I'm just telling him to explore his passions. Don't let his dreams be dreams, ya know 
I'm just trying to deal with not having a first round pick Jboss
I'm just trying to get a different card with better rewards
I'm just trying to give the Fuckholes closure 
I'm just trying to show Darrow how much he's slipping so he gets his shit together
I'm just waiting for Chan to claim Anna's 🐐 (this is not an actual 🐐 submission)
I'm just waiting for John or Kovin to answer, since they are the only ones who would respond seriously. Maybe Joe but I doubt he's ever let a woman with oily hands rub his bare skin
I'm just waiting for Seth Moulton to rise up and lead us
I'm just waiting for you 
I'm just waiting for you savage OTFers to see the light #AllAboutThatDiglettLyfe
I'm kind of an asshoke 
I'm kind of happy I got called in to work so I didn't have to watch this game
I'm kind of muscular in a 20 pounds over my ideal weight kind of way
I'm kinda disappointed that I also did not receive an angry message in the Groupme
I'm laying low with the emotionally disturbing posts. Trying to repair my brand's image
I'm leaving for work soon. Bye 
I'm leaving work now. I assume the fix is in?
I'm like 50% cheese, 50% no cheese but James River sauce is fucking amazing 
I'm like 89% sure that's a penis
I'm like an recovering addict who just got his first buzz in years. I NEED MORE 
I'm literally doing everything I can to not lose and I still might get fucked in the last minute 
I'm literally hearing the opposite right now from someone who is currently in that country 
I'm literally just listing anyone who comes to mind at this point 
I'm literally naming every basketball player I've ever heard of. I'm running out of people 
I'm literally not saying they're better off with only one year of education 
I'm literally on my way to TF Green (official airport of the Patriots) right now 
I'm literally right there 
I'm literally shaking with rage
I'm literally walking into work
I'm looking that up right now. One sec 
I'm losing a lot of respect for the Fuckholes' food preferences this past week 
I'm loving that this game is playing right into the hands of the #JustFacts✅ #Narrative
I'm loving this tour through the news courtesy of Chan. I never need to keep up on my own anymore
I'm mad
I'm mad that Bocker planned a trip to a place where he knew Morcus was going to be 
I'm making a real push this late in the season. I think I should be top 3 minimum 
I'm making American chop suey when I get to Florida 
I'm making my first foray into Canada in two weeks.
I'm may sound like an idiot here, but was anyone else not aware that the Maras and Rooneys were related?
I'm moonlighting tonight. No scans
I'm morally opposed to adding anyone to the GroupMe 
I'm more infuriated by Celiac's disease than my ranking
I'm more of an entomology guy
I'm more of Just A Dream kinda guy
I'm more open to it since I found out this past week that I will be on Family Medicine in May, so that should be fine
I'm more opposed to umbrellas than bus aids 
I'm more upset about the 36 unread GroupMe messages. You guys are letting him off easy 
I'm more worried about holding a Supreme Court seat open for over a year just without even allowing a hearing to vet the nominee
I'm much more of an Elon Tusk fan myself
I'm never happy with Chan's body
I'm never wrong 
I'm no longer a liability to other people around me, which is nice 
I'm normally a nugget porn kind of guy 
I'm normally team goody but I don't think this is fair
I'm not a basketball fan and got more than half of those answers. Give me the credit I deserve, goody 
I'm not a big music guy in general 
I'm not a cottage guy
I'm not a doctor, but that looks career ending 
I'm not a doctor. Call kovin 
I'm not a Giants fan. 
I'm not a GM or talent scout, but I would prefer Haskins based on his pocket presence, accuracy, and tendency to not make many mistakes. People are hoping that Kyler can provide an offensive spark like Baker and Mahomes - if he can do that, I can understand why people want him and those people obviously are a lot smarter than I am.
I'm not a med student
I'm not a playoff team. He's not worth $19 as a keeper for next year. And dropping him is probably not going to affect my matchup this week. I'm not really second guessing myself.
I'm not a pussy. I can go outside 
I'm not a smart man. 
I'm not above a pity invite 
I'm not advocating for drug companies to not charge a buttload. I'm just explaining why the process is flawed
I'm not allowed to correct them which is why Bocker's posts are now dog shit
I'm not an expert, but I am a guy who wants to make sure you end up on the list 
I'm not Anthony. I'm Joff
I'm not anti redskins, I actually was in support of them before goody started cheering for them tonight. I'm anti traitors 
I'm not any different than other men in America. I just spend most of my time thinking about blowsies and how to disparage Joe's reputation (not simultaneously)
I'm not applying to grad school this fall so I will probably have time then  
I'm not arguing that BC isn't part of Boston. I'm arguing that stupid people think that. Like BU fans 
I'm not arguing that it is right or wrong. Just saying it would be challenging to get up and running. There would be a lot of push back and arguments made
I'm not betting on human lives
I'm not bothering to listen. Gregg is my least favorite, big Marc and Dan supporter 
I'm not Christian 
I'm not complaining because I'm dooming Kovin to the Posa when I win tonight (technically tomorrow night since he has Moncrief)
I'm not convinced that @jordanbot isn't being controlled by a lobster mastermind 
I'm not convinced that she didn't murder him in the parking lot after work 
I'm not cool, so I can't tell you 
I'm not crazy right?
I'm not disputing that 
I'm not dissing the performers. I'm just saying that the halftime shows are always really boring 
I'm not even good enough to win the worst manager award 
I'm not even sure that Morcus has one kid, let alone kids 
I'm not excited. I just wish he apologized for hurting a good man for no reason
I'm not feeling the burn anymore guys 
I'm not flying until tomorrow night so it doesn't change anything
I'm not from Europe. Why should I give a shit about who is in the EU 
I'm not going into surgery, skimmer
I'm not going to admit that I looked back to try and prove that John didn't use the word "help" in his original post only to find out that he was right 
I'm not going to be applying to grad school next year, so by Goody's logic, I might as well quit 
I'm not going to be in Boston next weekend 
I'm not going to mention that i was at work before first delay and was not affected by this at all 
I'm not gunna admit to ever watching a video from the groupme, but if I did and I saw that a certain fantasy expert lost 5 straight games in fantasy, I would not take advice from him
I'm not hurt by it 
I'm not in the league, so I can't say anything negative
I'm not in the other groupme
I'm not kidding 
I'm not looking forward to whatever Marcus is about to say 
I'm not losing this week. 
I'm not making a third retirement insta story for him 
I'm not making any for the draft be sure you'll be there 
I'm not normally in favor of comparing success of children, because success is obviously measured differently in different people, but you would think having one son go to med school would be enough to convince your parents that Kyle can achieve more and they need to push him to do something
I'm not offended by the inclusion of holy cross kids to the tailgate list, but I am offended that Anthony Goodwin made it on the list. Fuck that guy. 
I'm not one to complain about likes, but this is criminally underliked
I'm not opposed to eliminating the SATs as a punishment, but admit that I'm very biased 
I'm not paying for it lol
I'm not playing 
I'm not pointing any fingers, but I am disappointed in some of the GroupMe members in here. Shame on me for thinking wordle would be sacred and free of cheating 
I'm not prepared to discuss any potential transactions at this time. I'm on to Bring Back Kickers
I'm not really disadvantaged in any way 
I'm not really mad about losing Tannehill, but I feel like as a Fuckhole, I have to express some sort of hatred for the rest of you in the form of a meme. 
I'm not rich enough to approve of this 
I'm not rich enough to have a second tv to keep baseball on in the background 
I'm not saying he's wrong. I'm just saying Jamie Collins didn't like to have the headset!
I'm not saying it's in the top 10, but it's good 
I'm not saying that I agree with his critics, but I think people wanted him to invest more in subsidized housing 
I'm not saying that we should extradite a sitting president, but that's also exactly what I'm saying
I'm not saying the season isn't going to happen, or that football isn't going to exist for a year. But I am sick of people treating COVID as "2 weeks in quarantine and then you are fine."
I'm not saying there aren't better places out there but you're literally the only person who doesn't like Voodoo 
I'm not siding with Joe. I'm siding with John who was literally always my friend
I'm not sleeping on Drachman and Jordanzer
I'm not sure @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco has been married yet, so I don't know how he could have attended his own wedding in full service dress 
I'm not sure being married would do anything to change whatever they calculate, since the government only gives out loans anyway and Tufts absolutely considers parental income even deciding institutional aid
I'm not sure Darrow can work 24/7 like that
I'm not sure exactly what she's looking to change with that program. I didn't have time to read into it yet 
I'm not sure he even would know what a Webex is
I'm not sure I agree with the penalty call but I'll take it. 
I'm not sure if that book I mentioned talks about it, or if it's in another book, but a lot of insurance costs are related to overhead in the insurance company. They spend a lot of money employing people to sift through claims and deny/approve them 
I'm not sure it's proven by science, but I would die on the hill defending this thought: the happiness of eating a buff chick cal has a greater positive impact your your health than the nutritional value of chia seeds 
I'm not sure that that's true. Kraft paid for the stadium with private money
I'm not sure that your idea of cream pie is what @goodybot is referring to
I'm not sure what they were protesting, but it was probably related to the red line (I'm ignoring the fact that it's been good this morning) 
I'm not sure why anyone would have to do shrooms while being in the Fuckholes. You guys make me high on life 
I'm not sure why everyone is celebrating the 1 year anniversary of Kobe's death. It's not like that man moved mountains or anything 
I'm not sure why I should personally care about this person's opinion
I'm not sure you can describe that as legally ambiguous 
I'm not sure, but if anyone can make it happen, it's aj mccarron
I'm not sure. I can't see that on my phone 
I'm not surprised that Chan likes superhero movies, given the fact that he has filmed himself doing flip kicks several times
I'm not surprised that the pats haven't but I am surprised that other teams haven't 
I'm not talking to myself. I'm talking to other Joff 
I'm not the one who brought it up 
I'm not torn up about it. His fault for playing a sissy sport
Im not torn up about it. I'm going to go back to not caring about the Bruins. 
I'm not trying to be a Scrooge and not participate. But I have a lot on my plate and limited funds spend on something that's not a necessity. I love me some Fuckholes, but I have to make sure my family gets gifts too 
I'm not upset. I am genuinely concerned that he has a hearing and/or memory issue
I'm not usually one to fish for likes but my catholic child molestation joke getting none is tragic
I'm not watching
I'm not watching the game but I assume that the bucs suck 
I'm not watching, what has happened Marcus
I'm not watching. But jj watt is trash 
I'm not working today, but since I only work 4 days a week, I now have to go in on Friday, which I normally get off
I'm not worthy 
I'm not, becker is going to win the bracket. Fuck becker. 
I'm not, just seeing if anyone else was 
I'm not. He was really moving BC in the right direction before we unfairly gave up on him 
I'm not. I couldn't care less 
I'm not. We don't need another loss
I'm nothing if not passionate about my death wishes. 
I'm noticing a trend with joe. Always a house guest, never a host. 
I'm now caught up with Better Call Saul and they are about to start the second half of the final season. I probably won't watch them live so I have to wait until all the episodes come out to use my AMC+ free trial, so I can binge them all in fewer than 7 days
I'm off #TeamBecker. Fuck the UFC 
I'm off on that Friday, which happens to be Angela's birthday. But I work 3-midnight on Saturday and 5pm-2am on Sunday
I'm on 2nd and 21 
I'm on board with Bock. That's why we are hanging out on Sunday and he's totally not going to cancel on me when no other Foxtrots come thru
I'm on board with calling it Emyr and Goody's team now 
I'm on episode 7 (I think) of season 1. It's pretty good. Between that, Severance, and The Pitt, my tv schedule just got full again 
I'm on episode 8 I think 
I'm on fire today 
I'm on fire. Can't stop me 
I'm on my computer, can't
I'm on night 1 of 5 
I'm on the "if someone else cancels" list 
I'm on the record as always supporting GroupMe 
I'm on the south shore right now and every Monday. Don't tell me im a bad friend
I'm on the subsidized league fee plan. Goody agreed to pay 60% of my dues as a fair and just commissioner. 
I'm on the way. I'm only coughing a little bit
I'm on this train 
I'm one away from immaculate on today's NFL grid, but I can't get the Seahawks/raiders player. I'm sure I'm overthinking it 
I'm one of only 3 people to actually watch every Pats preseason game. Calling me a pink hat just compliments every real pink hat out there
I'm only half way through
I'm only mustering up the strength to run so I don't have to listen to you people 
I'm only on episode 3, but so far I find it better that season 2, not as gripping as season 1, but based on what's happened so far, I think it could get good 
I'm only three quarters done. No spoilers!!!
I'm out
I'm out 
I'm out doing some hand to hands this morning 
I'm out of class at 530 so that works for me 
I'm out of immaculate grid
I'm out of work, and thus really enjoy fitness 
I'm out on "Bent it like Beckham"
Im OuT oN "dOnT @ mE" - Joe
I'm out on @Fantasy Baseball Champion, Esq. being out on brackets
I'm out on dinner. I've eaten out the last two nights and can't give John anymore ammo on me for not going to Austin. Down to meet up after
I'm out on Goody's power rankings now. 
Im OuT oN mArCuS bEiNg In ThIs GrOuPmE - me
I'm out on Nick Adams (Alpha Male) 
I'm out on Temu
I'm OuT oN tHe ToUcHdOwN bElL
I'm out on the whole #MaybeFacts thing
I'm OuT oN wEeK tWo TrOpHiEs
I'm partial to you fighting me and Jordan to sit in the hallway because you thought that was the bathroom and you were going to throw up 
I'm particularly impressed how you work so hard in grad school to achieve your dreams, yet you still are willing to participate in fantasy football with us. True courage and determination right there. 
I'm particularly interested in drug courts. I don't believe in incarceration. 
I'm perfectly content with my team 
I'm planning to chill with Ricky the dog. We shared three hours of a car ride together with him sleeping on my lap. Pretty safe to say we're best friends. 
I'm planning to put all my efforts into keeping the child alive for 18 years 
I'm plugged into some people's lives. cough @Skimmer  cough
I'm pondering my options. I'll let you know 
I'm poor from paying for for the ACTs so I vote just for fun 
I'm predicting a 75 yard draw touchdown to Jones on the next possession to end the game
I'm prepared to admit that becker won the survivor pool if Emyr would just denounce Goody 
I'm prepping for another run at last place
I'm pretty convinced by this argument. Embiid should play more
I'm pretty happy at 6
I'm pretty sure "speak now or forever hold your peace" is legally binding. Seems like an open and shut case. 
I'm pretty sure bc law graduates a week later normally 
I'm pretty sure Darrow's love fits in most girls 
I'm pretty sure he just responded to what you said 
I'm pretty sure I invited you and joe over at lunch. @Joey Brackets @The Big Dick Bandit can you confirm 
I'm pretty sure I knew all of that just from watching making a murderer 
I'm pretty sure I read that the current round of the tournament was 16 teams. Could be wrong 
I'm pretty sure I shit just fine 
I'm pretty sure if any of us voted naked, we would have to register as sex offenders
I'm pretty sure my abs are ripping apart and I may be dead in a few hours 
I'm pretty sure SJW think all non-SJW are hitler 
I'm pretty sure that man is also dead
I'm pretty sure that means you have shoulder AIDS, John
I'm pretty sure that theory was posted here
I'm pretty sure that was Marcus
I'm pretty sure that you've been at treehouse and market basket this week, not in front of a computer 
I'm pretty sure that's Devin's face 
I'm pretty sure that's porn chan. Goody produces enough of that for all of us 
I'm pretty sure the last few times I went, I didn't even get food. I just got a cherry limeade
I'm pretty sure the legality is pretty clear 
I'm pretty sure the social network came out after I gave them my email. We watched it as a group at the Fenway movie theater. 
I'm pretty sure there's just someone with the same name 
I'm pretty sure y'all were playing my NFL street on my PS2 sophomore year. Not sure my PS2 still works. 
I'm pro FA
I'm pro freedom. Any means necessary. 
I'm pro torture, but only the kind that we do to other people. Not the kind that terrorists do to us 
Im probably biased because I see so many players sign huge deals for the Red Sox that don't pan out, but I'd rather teams be able to cut players who aren't performing without having to pay out the remaining salary. It's probably naive, but I like to think that a player whose salary isn't guaranteed is going to put more effort into the game. 
I'm probably down by #9 or #10
I'm probably going to lose, so....
I'm probably just used to Belichick cutting so many people that I'm not fazed by it anymore 
I'm probably last because Angela and I are such good friends that even if we were both single, I would be stuck in the friend zone 
I'm probably out on dinner. I'm trying to save some money and have a lot of leftovers in my fridge. (I am a poor, confirmed) 
I'm probably right there too 
I'm pro-choice 
I'm projected to lose. Like usual. 
I'm pro-speeches at whatever event the bride prefers 
I'm pro-term limits for everything. I feel like it would prevent the Dems from fucking themselves over if they had to stop trotting out the same corpses election after election in Congress/POTUS races. If they had to more frequently build up the farm system, they may actually find someone electable
I'm pro-the party moving further left of center, but that could be a biased opinion because my political ideals align closer with that end of the spectrum
I'm proud of you. 
I'm quite happy with my future institution 
I'm quite invested in Vermont. I ain't going back to store brand maple syrup. Fuck that shit 
I'm quite upset I didn't get bear grease for Christmas 
I'm reading his Wikipedia page now. In interviews between 1970 and the 2000s, he went back and forth between declaring himself heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual like a dozen times. Dude was more sexually confused than goody when he ends up getting matched on tinder with a tranny 
I'm reading it and deliberately directing away
I'm reading now that samosas and caramel delights are made by two different companies and distributed differently around the country. The recipe is pretty much the same but they have subtle differences 
I'm reading that he's not officially on the IR since they activated Brissett from the IR yesterday 
I'm reading the globe article on TK's now: this stuck out to me
I'm ready to reverse #MyNarrative and say that bocker was trade raped 
I'm ready to vote for John now. 
I'm really jealous of whoever has Kenyan Drake and DK Metcalf 
I'm really not a fan of having to click the home button when I unlock my phone 
I'm really not sure. But I read somewhere that the league charges a relocation fee and seems like it's pretty fucking steep 
I'm really upset, though not surprised, that he didn't come in to talking about being punked sophomore year 
I'm refusing to acknowledge this but also want you to know that I didn't skim all the golf talk even though I wanted to 
I'm relevant in the fact that I helped knock you out of the playoffs 
I'm re-reading the NYT article about NYU. Best/worst statistic I found:
I'm reviewing slides for a presentation and after an hour, I'm on slide 11 out of 57. Do I get a congratulations, Joe?
I'm riding the green line right now. I forgot how much I hate the T. 
I'm right there bby
I'm right there with Jordan. I quit as soon as it got lame
I'm right there, I don't see you
I'm rooting for all the hopes and dreams of everyone associated with PSU to be stomped on like I stomped on Chan's fantasy team this year. 
I'm rooting for SF from here on out
I'm rooting for the comeback story 
I'm rooting for you
I'm rooting for you to buttfuck Darrow
I'm rooting for you to lose every bet 
I'm sad
I'm sad I missed Zo
I'm sad that bc is real bad at sports
I'm saying I am in trouble because my luck % dropped
I'm saying the majority of players who go pro don't make it and then they're fucked. I wish athletes were more concerned about getting educated 
I'm saying the school is cost prohibitive, which disproportionately affects people of lower SES. Which statistically speaking tend to be people of color
I'm scared for Marc Sessler's mental health
I'm seeing it. He facetimes me every time he goes to the bathroom/fondles himself 
I'm seeing quite a few double bogies
I'm set to red. Why do they keep adding me 
I'm shocked that no one else tried to pick up Martavius Bryant to keep for next year. Now I'm mad that I overspent for him 
I'm simply protecting the integrity of the Fuckholes
I'm sitting at my barber waiting for him to finish up his prior client. His conversation with his client has gone from "both trump and Biden would make terrible presidents" to "hospitals feed you terrible food when you have cancer because we know how to cure cancer with diets and the hospitals don't tell you that so they keep making money off of you" to "vanguard and blackrock created COVID to crash the housing market to buy up real estate and then jack the prices back up to kill the middle class"
I'm sitting in the airport and they're playing an interview with Ben Carson over the speakers. Carson mentions in the interview that there are certainly people who would be a better president than trump. He offered that quote without any prompting. The interviewers followed up and asked who he had in mind and he told them that he couldn't hear their question because of mic feedback and refused to answer. 
I'm sitting out to raise awareness for racial inequities 
Im sitting outside of south station waiting for my clinic partner who is late for like the 6th week in a row so it works for me
I'm skeptical about why we didn't hear about this sooner 
I'm skipping the gym to hang out with my good friend Bocker 
I'm smelling an upset 
I'm so behind 
I'm so bored 
I'm so confident that Dealing Big Bill is going to trade for Sherman, you know what I'm going to do? 
I'm so confused 
I'm so fucking dumb
I'm so fucking ready for BB to take the Raiders job 
I'm so glad that he's on my team 
I'm so glad that I am a real Celtics fan and didn't forget they were playingast night. It was great to watch every minute of that game. 
I'm so glad that it's Friday. I've worked two Friday's in a row. This is awful #WoeIsMe
I'm so glad to be on the side of truth and justice. Thank you for showing me the light, Patriot Nation. 
I'm so glad you said something. I am scheduled to work tonight and tomorrow night but now I know that I don't have to 
I'm so happy I have #JustFacts*GreenCheckmark* to back me up 
I'm so happy I make 6 figures without even having to work
I'm so happy I've been a celtics fan since day one. This bandwagon is getting awfuly crowded 
I'm so happy that @Certified Zappe Pathologist @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD @Chanos the Mad Poster @Jamie Bourque @Ass Ketchum @AbadBot @Skimmer @Josh Dobbs Stan and me all had the team of our youths win. I'm also happy that @Haha Clinton Dix's team, the nazis, again lost this week
I'm so happy that LeBron's legacy is tarnished 
I'm so horny right now 
I'm so irate right now. I can't even look at you.
I'm so lonely 
I'm so mad at myself
I'm so much smarter than all of you 
I'm so not monied that I am moonlighting tonight 
I'm so sick of Romo saying "if there's a chaaaaaance"
I'm so smart. I bet @Marcus Bauer and @Skimmer would not give you that key insider info 
I'm so sorry @Jamie Bourque 
I'm so sorry to hear that Emyr. Is there anything we can do? Set up a meal train? 
I'm so sorry you lost all your money and live in a cardboard box now 
I'm so unworried that I won't even be turning the game on until after the 3rd 
I'm sorry @Anesto's Fairweather Fan. That was rude of me. Best of luck in all your future endeavors.
I'm sorry but I don't hear color.
I'm sorry but I have to stand in solidarity with my friend Bocker. Also no one mentions that I agreed to pay the $50
I'm sorry Chan. If anyone's spoiled, it's Becker for having the deluxe cable package. I'm just a poor basic cable guy without ESPN. 
I'm sorry Emyr. Goody and I really tried. Some Fuckholes just have no respect 
I'm sorry for your loss
I'm sorry I failed you
I'm sorry Marcus, it's not my decision. It's what must happen
I'm sorry that bocker has wronged you in this way. 
I'm sorry that Bocker was rude and didn't let you share his meat with more Fuckholes 
I'm sorry that happened to him
I'm sorry that his career is essentially over. 
I'm sorry that I did this too you 
I'm sorry that I didn't clearly articulate my point clearly enough for you, Bocker, but no one else seems to think I'm saying that drugs don't work
I'm sorry that my application process is affecting your stress levels. 
I'm sorry that the battles in world war 2 don't conform well enough to the plot of a series about the battles in world war 2, Joseph 
I'm sorry that those idiots treated you so poorly, Goody. 
I'm sorry that you exist 
I'm sorry that you have players on your team that don't feel that way
I'm sorry that your life is not more interesting. It's quite depressing to think that you call this news.
I'm sorry that your original opinion was wrong but happy they you found your way
I'm sorry to ask those I let down, and I'm especially sorry to all the haters that think they beat me. I'll come back stronger. 
I'm sorry to hear that
I'm sorry you feel that way. I am just looking out for you as a concerned friend.
I'm sorry you felt victimized by EMS 
I'm sorry. 
I'm spending my birthday learning an emr that's outdated by about 25 years. So that's fun 
I'm srsly about going for that. Proved they can't stop you. 
I'm starting the rumor that it was @Hongy T who removed Devin 
I'm starting to lose hope that the Patriots will get their first round pick back.....
I'm starting to think that @👀  never really wanted to play Warzone with Darrow and me
I'm starting to think that the Patriots may miss the playoffs 
I'm starting to think that the Patriots might not win the Super Bowl this year
I'm staunchly pro vaccination because I am pro being a magnetic alligator 
I'm staying in and hanging out but would welcome anyone that wants to come over 
I'm still alive at my wedding for those keeping score 
I'm still bringing Catan, correct? 
I'm still confused with those two names 
I'm still convinced that Marvin Lewis will lose between this week and super bowl week and the Bengals will be eliminated 
I'm still definitely gunna lose this week
I'm still down to go Saturday if you and darrow are still interested in going 
I'm still expecting to lose 
I'm still furious that we lost that game. I stayed up an extra 30 minutes for it 
I'm still hoping that marshawn realizes he'd rather be playing football than riding camels in Egypt and that he comes back 
I'm still in Maine 
I'm still mad
I'm still not convinced that Kristen was ever able to give up running it so I expect that she's out there right now
I'm still not convinced that Zac Taylor exists
I'm still not losing this week or next 
I'm still on #TeamEmily after her impressive performance taking over for Bock Boi that one time 
I'm still on 3rd down after the turnover 
I'm still on plastic surgery call and I just had to tell a teenager that she was going to need pinky surgery and that her defensive end career was likely over 
I'm still on season 1 and I find it fairly tough
iM sTiLl OuT oN tHe ToUcHdOwN bElL
I'm still predicting a loss to Jboss, regardless of how many points I end this game with. Gurley is gunna somehow top it tomorrow
I'm still recovering from the TLoU finale 
I'm still sad 
I'm still sad 
I'm still salty, and not in a balanced flavor way
I'm still so confused about that thing with that girl and people being naked. 
I'm still so heated. 
I'm still trying to overturn the Brady suspension 
I'm still waiting for Google Glass to change my life. I haven't lost hope 
I'm still waiting for halftime to be over 
I'm still waiting for them to call 2007 Eli Manning down by giving himself up after being wrapped up in the backfield
I'm still waiting for Tupac to show up at halftime
I'm still waiting for White Mountain to sponsor an NIL deal 
I'm still waiting for you to admit that you were wrong about bringing back bickers
I'm still waiting to open a natty, Bud light, and rubinof-only liquor store in campus tan's location 
I'm still working tho 
I'm still working tho 
I'm still worried about #JustFacts✅ 
I'm straight up not having a good time
I'm strategically moving closer to North Reading so I can more easily hang out with Goody when he's home
I'm streaming on Hulu and I'm still participating. Don't be a bitch. 
I'm streaming through the NESN website now using my dad's Xfinity account. Thanks for the help Becks
I'm strongly anti-long Covid
I'm stuck on the last one for the football grid 
I'm summation, that's why you treat me like royalty. Love you babe 
I'm super behind in listening. I still haven't heard the MNF recap 
I'm supposed to be flying to Texas tomorrow. Why don't I take Becker's car and drive down there instead? Then I will leave it there and take my flight back. 
I'm sure @JustFacts✅ has driven to Fort Meade many times. I would certainly expect him to have detailed travel information 
I'm sure Darrow is coming through and that Bock is driving the hour and a half to come down to see us since I did the same last week 
I'm sure darrow's landlords have property insurance 
I'm sure Dr. Winter would treat you pro bono. Most of his patients are like 20-25 anyway
I'm sure freeman will make up for it with 30 points 
I'm sure Goody and I both got it right
I'm sure Hafley's 4th season to install his own system will be much better
I'm sure having a back up qb without having a timeout in the fourth quarter will go well for them
I'm sure he already has 
I'm sure he came in and led the team to victory 
I'm sure he does. The thing I hate the most is all the publicity that espn is giving to his father, who is not a professional athlete. 
I'm sure he just stepped away to cook a perfect steak for his lovely wife 
I'm sure he probably saw his dick in her and not much else. 
I'm sure he vodka water didn't help with that problem 
I'm sure he'd make a great DC in a year or two 
I'm sure he'll answer any moment
I'm sure he'll be at UNC if he coaches again 
I'm sure he'll send it as soon as you send him the championship belt 
I'm sure Henry had a lot of rushing yards, since he's the best RB in the league 
I'm sure he's probably maybe fine
I'm sure he's spending time with his loving family on this joyous holiday instead of ruining everyone else's day in the GroupMe 
I'm sure I could get goody to move in exchange for whatever he makes from felating (spelling?) coworkers through glory holes in his company bathroom 
I'm sure I will strive for something naturally gluten free, like Marcus's wedding
I'm sure I would feel differently, however, if I fundamentally disagreed with the laws 
I'm sure I'll end up putting up a solid 78 points 
I'm sure I'm in the minority in my opinion but I very much dislike her as a person and an artist 
I'm sure it is. I just don't want to watch with you. 
I'm sure it's not a coincidence 
I'm sure it's sucked raw at this point 
I'm sure I've earned many more L's today 
I'm sure Jameson will be thrilled to sit in a stroller for 15 miles 
I'm sure John will answer in a timely manner while we are still discussing this conversation
I'm sure Kevin cares about John, to some degree at least 
I'm sure many of them will go out of business. Then other, more local restaurants will decide to expand out to fill the void. Those restaurants will begin to source cheaper, unhealthier food and fulfill the prophecy of being the new equivalent to Olive Garden 
I'm sure Marcus has extensively product tested thousands of bags of both himself and will surely weigh in with results
I'm sure Marcus is as devastated as i am
I'm sure Marcus is shaking in his boots right now 
I'm sure Marcus will be happy to know that his pee hole isn't worth $70 to you 
I'm sure Morcus loves it 
I'm sure Morcus supported the anesthesiologist from Tufts who just got arrested for child.sex trafficking. By all accounts, he was a great anesthesiologist. Why does it matter if he tries to rape children if he does his job well
I'm sure Rwanda is safe. No need to worry about anything at all
I'm sure she's said that multiple times
I'm sure Teddy will come back on a team friendly deal...
I'm sure that Joe really are her booty hole 
I'm sure that Tom really feels bad that you hate him, Becker 
I'm sure the boxed mattresses all have patents, so there is no way they can be the same 
I'm sure the grocery store changes, the mask policy, the closure of movie theaters, etc will last a lot longer but gutta let the other businesses trickle open
I'm sure the senators don't feel that way 
I'm sure the White House is full of fruity pebbles 
I'm sure there is a smut sociology journal you could have this published in if you get the sample size large enough to eliminate the possibility of error due to a skewed sample 
I'm sure they are very keen to move their new stadium and built-up mall, movie theatre, restaurants, and hall of fame closer to Boston
I'm sure they were. But us basic cable folks have to rely on vines that we see on Twitter to see out of network games. Everything has been biased against obj
I'm sure they won't need that extra point tonight
I'm sure this hire will definitely work out for them
I'm sure this post will age well 
I'm sure you did a great job 
I'm sure you understand why 
I'm sure you'll figure it out before we all leave 
I'm sure you'll find a way. I have found a way for the past four years 
I'm sure your parents would love to take you back in 
I'm surprised he isn't a senator/lawyer/professional athlete yet
I'm surprised it took this long to lose moral high ground 
I'm surprised it's not butter
I'm surprised that @Tier 1 Poster isn't a bigger LeBron fan. After voting for Trump 6 times and protesting NH vaccine requirements, I wouldn't be surprised if he's hugging Xi's nuts as well 
I'm surprised that they didn't pull him when he took the shot on the slide. Hard to knock him for that play, he was sliding down when he took that shot. Really should have been penalized 
I'm surprised they let you near children 
I'm surprised we didn't get a repost of someone else's Instagram story*
I'm surprised we haven't heard about how this quarantine scenario is a gross violation of the Office characters' civil liberties
I'm surprised you haven't been here all day with becker gone 
I'm surprised you know 4000 words 
I'm surprised you're not diverting to NM to steal jordans girl
I'm suspicious of your interest in my life
I'm switching from nights to days. Always the worst 
I'm taking Emyr 
I'm taking it down as we speak 
I'm taking the Patriots
I'm talking about Frankie
I'm talking to my friend Bocker, so it's always a good day in the GroupMe 
I'm taxiing to the runway so I guess I'll find out in an hour when I land 
I'm telling you that 
I'm texting goody about the pats game and I am 95% sure he's not actually watching it and is just going along with whatever I say 
I'm thankful for Ricky.
I'm the highest in week 11. Give me the belt. 
I'm the joke
I'm the medical critical resident on. I have not had a single patient activated to the critical care area. I inherited one patient that already had a chest x-ray done by the time I saw him. But his dimer was up so I ordered his CT 
I'm the only one who supports him
I'm the opposite. I enjoy blowsies very much. 
I'm the same way with phone calls. I hate calling people 
I'm the son of a gym teacher. Dodgeball is literally in my blood 
I'm the youngest by 9 years 
I'm there
I'm there 730-4 most days. Occasionally later. This is my second and fortunately last 24 of the rotation 
I'm thinking I'll have to fly Friday afternoon after classes. I'm not sure what the schedule for that day will be yet, so I don't know if I have mandatory classes on Friday morning
I'm thinking of burning down Joe's half of his condo 
I'm thinking of first round draft pick Titus Howard. Who are you thinking of?
I'm thinking of scheduling a massage for myself after I finish Step 1. Anyone have any recommendations of places around Boston?
I'm thinking pretty good. PFT has been reporting that elway has pretty much moved on 
I'm throwing a house party in chan's apartment. 
I'm tired of seeing an empty alumni stadium. I think the appeal of a football game at Fenway would draw fans of the sport, not just BC fans 
I'm too busy breeding shiny beasts in Hogwarts Legacy
I'm too busy thinking about the effects of deceptive journalism on the political leanings of voters in the US
I'm too lazy to click the link. What's the time of the rock climbing? I actually have to work for most of the day tomorrow and not sure if I'll be able to make it
I'm too sad to post a high five gif 
I'm torn because I want @Chank Hill to be happy but hate Russ but also do not want to hear Gregg Rosenthal talk about Geno anymore 
I'm torn. I don't want to give Becker anything to be happy about, so I morally can't vote for Captain Kirk. But then again, i fucking hate goody so I can't vote for eifert. I abstain from voting 
I'm totally fine. Car got a couple dents but not bad
I'm totally going to start sending dildos to your address now 
I'm trying man
I'm trying to encourage optimism here guys. 
I'm trying to finish my draft of my personal statement before a meeting with my advisor at 2. I high key hate writing about myself
I'm trying to make that pinacha like we had the other night. Will report on results after 
I'm trying to tell myself that Chan's comments aren't subtweets directed against me...
I'm trying to watch football, not be depressed
I'm type 3 or 4 during the week where I have more fiber for breakfast. I don't eat as much fiber on the weekends so I drop to a 5
I'm unfortunately saving limbs
I'm uninvited to turkey dinner? 
I'm University of Cincinnati Medical Center, there is an EM resident about to shit his/her pants when he/she walks in a room and finds the leader of Tuanon  
I'm up 25.5 with Brees and Rudolph to go but he has Thomas, Kamara, and Thielen (and Gostowski) which is why I said technically projected....
I'm up top with my hand up
I'm up with my hand up
I'm used to having my heart broken
I'm usually more concerned about getting through the flight without having panic attacks 
Im v happy af rn as I watch the end of this game on my flight 
I'm v scared af right now
I'm v surprised af about rank choice voting in MA. Hardly heard any opposition before election day
I'm v sympathetic af to the challenges that business owners face right now. If you don't have customers, you can't pay your debts or your employees. While I may fall on the other side of the argument, I understand wanting looser restrictions to help businesses, especially if federal aid doesn't seem to be coming any time soon. That said, you lose all my sympathy when your reasoning for loosening restrictions is "rona is fake and Big Vaccine is going to control my mind" 
I'm vaf happy that my Ners are going to the super bowl but I feel like there was a huge missed opportunity for the State Farm Auto Insurance bowl 
I'm very concerned about his well being. Not concerned enough to text him, but still above my baseline level of concern 
I'm very confident in my side's ability to find a few million extra votes in the swing states
I'm very confident that I could outrun a lawnmower 
I'm very conflicted with our o line coach getting fired. On one hand, the o line was abysmal all season. They didn't seem to improve anywhere and they constantly put Brady in a situation where his well being was put in jeopardy. So I get that. But on the other hand, in his two seasons here, he coached a ragtag o line to a super bowl victory, lost three captains (traded mankins, Connelly retired, Wendell to ir), lost a starting left tackle for the season early on, had to play with a tackle who was given a huge contract for piss poor play (which should be blamed on the front office, not the o line coach), and had to coach up four draft picks. He didn't exactly have an easy job 
I'm very conflicted. I've always liked tiger woods but I cant like him anymore since he's Becker's love obsession. 
I'm very confused 
I'm very excited to never be invited over to play 
I'm very much anti carb in my diet but I'm about to eat a muffin so I guess I can't really get all preachy right now

Implies that you enforce the act of chicken fucking, which you admitted to performing

In 2005, last year of his career, played 8 games and had 78 yards 
In 2006 he rushed for 13 touchdowns, 1528 yards on 346 carries. He had 90 catches for 806 yards and 3 touchdowns 
In 2012.
In 2014, 6/39 overtime games ended on the first possession 
In 2018 (yes, 2018), a major US bank was sued for intentionally discriminating against black and latinos applying for housing loans. I am not trying to sweet the experience of the Asian community under the rug, but the data are very strong that these issues are still plaguing black communities today.

"In a recent quote on NBC's pregame show for Sunday Night Football, as shared by Ben Volin, Devin McCourty spoke out about Mayo and turned the criticism back on the head coach.

“The first thing I think of is toughness isn’t a skillset. You don’t need to be fast or do anything special to be tough,” McCourty said. ""The second part of that is, why Jerod? Why is this team not tough? When you hear a team isn’t tough and they are soft, ‘What is the head coach doing?’ How is he getting them ready to go? Mayo and that staff have a lot of questions to answer going in next week.”"

In a similar vein, Carnegie steel?
In a way, yes 
In addition to tailing my suits, they also tailored them 
In addition to the anti hoarding thing....one argument is that people don't know how to use n95s. There are some models that are one size fit all, but most require professional fit testing to confirm proper use. If you have the wrong size, you aren't protested 
In agreement with Morcus, I wonder how many illnesses would have been avoided if the Biogen conference in Boston was avoided, since that directly moved the virus from China to Boston
In Alberta, Canada
In all honest, that kick was a perfect representation of our team’s effort 
In all honesty though, I made some pretty bomb honey sriracha wings. Really the important part of the game. And I was told that I have perfected my buffalo chicken dip game. I can die happy 
In all honesty though, it seems like the refs have been incredibly incompetent in a lot of games and have been affecting a lot of outcomes 
In all honesty, I agree with going for it, don't agree with pitching it. 
In all honesty, I think the lack of caring comes from Leahy, not necessarily from Bates. That Boston Globe article was pretty scathing 
In all honesty, id like to hide from the rest of the world for the next four years. Yaaaay isolationism. 
In all honesty, the general public should care about the first issue. Academic medicine and non-profit medical careers pay significantly less than private practice jobs. Eliminating loan forgiveness disincentivizes doctors from going into those fields, which means fewer physicians in underserved areas and fewer experts training the next generation of doctors or doing research  
In all my years of being Kovin's roommate, I didn't realize I was living with a psychopath 
In all seriousness, absolutely terrible. I read that the Bangladesh national cricket team was just pulling up to the mosque as the shooting started.
In all seriousness, I don't think I've picked the Steelers yet, so I will go with them. If I have picked them, I'll go with the Giants. 
In all seriousness, the Fuckholes are welcome at my apartment for the super bowl. I am sure everyone would prefer an apartment with HD and more space, but I'll gladly be your fallback option 
In all seriousness, this is a good response 
In an arena, no less
In an idea world, I think the right to a visa/access to the path to citizenship should be handled as embassies. But the world is in such turmoil that the time it would take for people to get through the bureaucratic would be too long, and a lot of people acutely suffering hardship or threat of personal injury would die before they make it to the US. that's definitely a driving factor towards people coming to the US illegally 
In another cruel twist of fate, related to what Joe posted about the woman who was shot at the capitol: 
In b4 goody posts a picture of the longest yard
In before "BILLS MAFIA!!!!!"
In before he makes a comment about how that would mean you should like college football 
In before Joe posts about BC basketball beating UNC
In Bocker's defense, what boss wouldn't look at a nice pair of tits and say, "heh, nice."
In Boston, there are several vaccine outreach programs that are going into the community and vaccinating people in their neighborhood or even their housing development. This is mostly occurring in lower income communities and serving mainly people of color. They are usually using the J&J vaccine because they don't have to make a return trip into the community to revaccinate several weeks later. So now not only do these people have equity issues in terms of access, but now it comes to light that we have been giving these communities a potentially more dangerous vaccine 🙃

In Fung's 2014 gubernatorial campaign, he disclosed that he had been involved in a fatal car crash in 1989. Fung said he lost consciousness and struck and killed James W. Skipper Jr., who had stopped on the side of the road to change a tire. Fung was charged in the incident but a grand jury did not indict him.
In general, neither am I. In this particular instance, don't break the law 
In general, not specifically to this situation 
In Goody's defense, I don't think financial accounting covered this topic. Becker and I aced that curriculum freshman year 
In high school, I got paid minimum wage ($8/hr) to work in the tech department. After 3 years, my coworker and I wrote a letter to the superintendent to ask for a raise. We were pumped to get a raise to $9/hr. MA increased the minimum wage like 2 weeks later
In high school, I made a your mom joke (I don’t remember exactly what it was but I think it very benign) to a kid whose mom died like 10 years earlier and I had no idea. He tried to fight me in the gym locker room and I didn’t understand what I had done until someone told me that his mom was dead
In his defense, he asked the groupme and no one objected. 
In his defense, he thought he threw it out like all the other gifts he’s gotten
In his defense, Marcus has been better at responding. It just takes him minimum 4 hours and he often waits until the conversation has shifted three or four times before he responds with zero context to what he's responding 
In his post draft analysis, Goody said that picking up Big Ben was a solid move. For this reason, I stand by it.

In Joe's case, it means pissed on. 
In John’s defense, he missed some throws early in the game where I felt like pressure was affecting him. However, John is still wrong because Brady he put up one of the statistically best games of his career 
In Josh’s defense, who hasn’t banged the announcer’s mom

In other words, the police must show why each individual suspect may be a threat to dispose of evidence, flee or attack the police. They can’t simply state that all drug suspects present such a threat. As Stevens points out, the burden for the police here isn’t high. They just have to provide something.

In response to last night's conversation about Dr. Chao. I wouldn't say what he's doing is unethical or scumbag-y. I did notice that he no longer posts his thoughts directly to twitter - he has a new blog site that has a pay wall, but I think sucks because he's turning his back on the social media platform that made him famous in the first place

In Stowe. Went to a restaurant that is always booked weeks in advance, but their patio is first come, first serve. When we showed up, only one table on the patio was taken, 7 were open. We go to get a table and they tell us that they can only seat tables of 4 or fewer on the patio. We have 5 of us. Fine. So we ask to split into tables of 2 and 3 and offer to pay separately. They tell us no, they don't have space for that. Am I insane that that's crazy?

In terms of failures, how big of a failure is this, The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) 
In terms of testing, it wasn't Trump's fault (unless you pin the blame on him for his picks for CDC director and FDA director). The WHO offered the CDC a test that had been implemented in dozens of countries and the CDC chose to formulate their own, which didn't work. While countries were testing 100s of thousands per day, the US was testing 100. The FDA restricted test development from private companies where countries like South Korea streamlined approval processes and partnered with private firms to increase capacity 
In terms of the Barstool news, I just hope Jenna Marbles lands on her feet 
In that case I love it 
In that case I support calling out 
In that case, 1-11

In that case, I hope you have an above average day
In that case, I say we go to Chan's this weekend 
In that case, I vote for the People's Republic of Cambridge. 
In that case, I will keep using it
In that case, I'll leave in about an hour to maximize my Fuckhole time. @The Duke let me know if you'd like a ride 
In that case, smart move 
In that case, we should invest in a fuckholes fallout shelter.

In the multiverse, there is a world where Bock and Erica are married with 12 kids, Goody transferred from BC to UMass to get closer to Savana and meets Frankie independently, Darrow and Frank the cat don't smoke blunts on the reg, Prima never becomes the better half of Bocker, and Stephen Wu is our best friend

In the red zone is dumb*
In the student center. That'd be real smelly 
In the time it took you to text him, you could have switched him yourself 
In the USSR, no less 
In the words of Chan: FOH @The Big Dick Bandit 
In theory, that’s obviously a catch. But that was the proper application of the no catch rule 
In this case, Bocker is just saying what we are all thinking
In this day in age, nothing is guaranteed. He could get hurt next year, or he could regress. It seems like a lot of players are choosing to go to the NFL early for the money. Seems like the safest career move 
In this female's defence, ending and starting a relationship during senior week does not seem lucrative. Even if it is with the loveliest man in all of the mods

Insurance also spends more money paying people to deny healthcare claims and to advertise than they would if they just paid the claims out

Interesting choices 
Interesting debate for Boston sports fans. When the Bruins won the cup, we vilified Tim Thomas for not going to the White House because Tim Thomas didn't like Obama. Marcellus Bennett said during media day that he wouldn't go to the White House if the Pats win because he doesn't like Trump. Do we give him a pass because Trump is a dinglenut or is he going to catch a lot of flak for not going

Interesting stat, the last first round wide receiver to win a Super Bowl was santonio Holmes in 2009
Interesting that we don't have a camera angle on McDermott calling the time out 
Interesting thing I saw about the Meyers TD pass. The Pats called timeout before the play, and Meyers took his gloves off in the huddle. If the Ravens had noticed, they might have keyed in on what was coming.
Interesting thought John, but I think Darrow has waited to long to get his name out there 
Interesting thought. The league announced yesterday that teams can now virtually interview head coaching candidates starting today. The Jets have kept Gase because he gave them the best chance to get the number one pick. Now they don't have the pick and they are stuck with Gase and can't get a jump start on finding a new coach

The Bucs offer him a 3 year contract to be the highest paid coordinator in NFL history, contingent on him not taking a second interview.

He tells the Bucs that he has to go visit his sick kid and instead goes to Jacksonville to interview again. The Bucs try to call him several times throughout the day and he ignores all of their attempts at contact

Isolation often happens in a hospital. Example: COVID wards where only COVID patients or patients with symptoms are admitted. If isolating at home, people with active disease are told to stay in one room, away from others. If you are told to quarantine, it is usually done at home and there are not usually instructions on limiting interaction with other household members
Israel is bombing Qatar now. They just gunna bomb every Arab country? 
Israel released some secret Intel that Iran actually never fully about down their program but that Intel was from a few years ago so it's unclear if it's even relevant. But it seems like that was used to provide cover to pull out of the deal because Israel hates Iran and would probably prefer them to be sanctioned 
Israel?

It absolutely doesn't make sense to get a couple quick passes on first and second down to try to establish some confidence and get a 3rd and short. Instead, let's run into a stacked box because everyone knows we are going to run 
It ain't a joke brah. It's a real thing and it's on Google 
It all comes down to who Goody votes for 
It all comes full circle
It all goes back to the toothpick bridge I built in 6th grade tech ed
It already happened. 
It also isn't how you actually feel. Don't lie.
It also makes me pretty anxious to not have a pick in the first 72 picks 
It also means I can walk to South Station instead of taking an uber to Logan
It apparently took ski patrol 8 hours to find him after he was found missing. He must have been way off trail. Seven different agencies were looking for him 
It be your own best man sometimes
It can kind of go under #7 but #NotMyNarrative
It can't be that hard to make a podcast app that actually functions 
It can't be true bizzaro world because Murray still sucks 
It checks out.
It clearly is meant to hide whatever the picture really was of, Nock doesn't want us to know the truth
It condensed 
It could always be an appy but the pain is usually persistent, starts at the belly button and moves to the right lower quadrant, and is associated with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/fevers
It could be a jail cell hanging joke too
It could not be more clear - Obama supports Seth Moulton
It could not have possibly happened when Caleb had Odunze, Allen, Moore, and Kmet to throw to. Surely multiple receiving targets were not available this game for him to play this badly
It covers everything from fire damage to theft. It's like $15/month. And a lot of landlords in Boston require it 
It depends if a zombie can break down my door or if they're as weak as Bocker
It depends if the pats receivers can get open quickly enough to allow Brady to get the ball out of his hands
It depends on if you plan to have the Pats game on exclusively at 4 pm 
It depends what time. I have my fam med exam all morning and then a PCP appt at MGH at 4 pm, which means I will definitely not be home until 6 pm at the earliest. If you're planning on going on the later side, sure. Any earlier than that, can't make it 
It depends whether I have my sweet facial hair or not 
It did not move 
It did not post nick 
It did used to be ad free though. Now the only perk is you get to watch more than just the most recent episode and you get like one minutes less of ads 
It did, but I get mine through MGH. Did yours not? 
It didn't deter me from picking a team tho\
It didn't even load an add when I tried it 
It didn't even notify me that he was kicked 
It didn't work 
It didn't work because I didn't get gronk. You failed. 
It does have to be a light-mode loser, of which I believe Morcus is one
It does kind of suck that the only reason they can't take nudies is because they're famous. Famous people should be able to take nudes too 
It does matter. If you're wrong, you're wrong 
It does not, as far as I know, but don't let me ruin your decision. If you pick somewhere I can't eat, I'll just eat before and get a drink while you guys eat 
It does sound like the fault of the army crew on the helicopter...
It does track 
It doesn't "recommend" places. It's a user-generated list of places that are reported to have gluten free options 
It doesn't answer the initial why. But it does make sense that as kids stop playing, leagues and teams become less available and spread out which exacerbates the issue 
It doesn't count as skimming if you respond to a prior post only to find that someone else had a similar thought later on, as long as you recognize the parallel thinking across the space time continuum
It doesn't even make sense 
It doesn't expand Medicare. Medicare is still for those 65+ or receiving dialysis. It had a measure to expand Medicaid but a lot of states didn't ratify that 
It doesn't help that lacy hasn't looked the same 
It doesn't help when every game has 19 penalties
It doesn't help when you drop you $200 mil defensive line back to cover every other play 
It doesn't look like they're as sought after. There are definitely more tickets available for upcoming shows than there were when the original cast was there. I'm sure I could make a profit but I don't think I could see them for the $800 that they were going for 
It doesn't make sense that they are trying to tank, unless ownership has a written promise that their jobs are safe
It doesn't make the question any less wrong 
It doesn't matter if he was right. I wanted to hear from my good friend Morcus 
It doesn't matter if you're playing to the strength of your team 
It doesn't need to be primary care. There is a primary care program but what Kovin is referring to is valid if you work at any nonprofit, which academic medical centers are 
It doesn't specify in the Tweet I stole it from
It expires in September 
It feels good to have the opportunity to say, "fuck people that wear yellow gloves/cleats" again 
It feels just wrong to be happy goody's player scoring 
It feels wrong when you don't
It gets lonely being wrong by yourself
It gets retweeted by Bernie all the time. I never read their articles, they seem too hardcore left, even for me.
It gives me great pleasure to see that this groupme has shifted back from a fuck off Joff groupme to a Joe is a hoe groupme 
It gives the real avatar series a bad name
It goes along with the 0.25 points/reception that "Joe" set for the league
It goes the other way too Jordan. The argument is that without net neutrality, ISPs could throttle bandwidth to high traffic sites to limit the amount of data customers use to maximize profits 
IT gunna have more hip surgery 
It has "league" in its name, so I guess by default, yes. 
It has always sucked Ryan. The days of good espn are long gone 
It has been 5 minutes and he hasn't responded. He must already be dead.
It has been on all the major national news agencies. It isn't like they noticed it and were like, "woops, that's not right!" They started distributing vaccines until residency directors and department chairs publicly declined to be vaccinated until their residents got the vaccine
It has been spoken in the groupme, so now it shall be fact 
It has made 3 moves with me without getting touched
It has me literally shaking with rage 
It has never been tried with the resources that the FDA has. This isn't the appropriate time to trial a new review peocess
It has to be when it costs more than people can afford 
It has to cover it but the health center is allowed to not provide contraception. 
It helps you empathize with the people on welfare, goody 
It hurts them without Edelman, but I still they they have the speed and skill to get the backs out quicker 
It involves the gaming GroupMe. You wouldn't be interested
It is 3:07 pm. Why am I still seeing people talk instead of people tackling each other
It is 710. I demand to be let in 
It is a fake budget for a month long public health project, I don't think they are taking stocks into account
It is a hockey team. Not obscure 
It is a league of 15 of the best European soccer clubs (12 permanent members, sounds like 3 will be rotated in and out) that will comprise of a "regular season" and a tournament. It is similar to the Champion's League, except that the CL does not have permanent teams and your spot is dependent on performance in your domestic league
It is a shame that the female participants in this discussion did not recognize the time that Goody raped Morcus as a time where a men's resource center would be beneficial
It is a shitty situation, but maybe if some people in charge cared more about people dying than politics, we could have prevented it.
It is a Steam/mobile game that is similar to mafia
It is a strawman, you're right but I just meant that this isn't the only fucked up thing to happen in recent Supreme Court history.
It is almost as if the highest-ranking elected official could be using his platform to support and encourage peaceful demonstration instead of inciting violence, building walls, hiding in a bunker, and going to Maine to disassemble a national monument
It is also not a 1.
It is always illegal to make contact with a QBs helmet unless they establish themselves as a runner. It is always illegal to lower your head and initiate contact with your helmet. Helmet to helmet is not inherently illegal unless it is on a defense receiver, which Allen was not
It is amazing how far we have come. Bill Clinton can't get a blowsie in his office without getting impeached but America tolerates a lot more right now.
It is announced prior to the draft every year.....
It is closer to $150 but you're still off by quite a bit in one direction or the other 
It is crazy that the peak of romantic movies was American Pie and Eurotrip 
It is crazy to me that ESPN pays a national reporter strictly to be LeBron's fluffer
It is different from every specialty with every hospital. For surgery, my hours were 5 am to anywhere between 3 pm to 7 pm. I was there until 8:30 pm one day. For medicine, it was 7am - 6 pm. For pediatrics, 6:30 am to 6 pm.
It is essentially is a huge revenue grab for the teams in the SL because their spots are guaranteed every year (for at least 12 of them) and the structure ensures that only the best of the best are included
It is evening. I go to bed in 2 hours 
It is funny because BU sucks
It is great because you make it great 
It is highly possible that I am misremembering the location
It is his birthday today if anyone else wants to text him
It is kind of weird that Nidoking is pink, right?
It is more fun to call you a super spreader 
It is more of a personal pet peeve than a significant distinction, honestly
It is not a learning experience. They are working with the school to create anti-racism initiatives. We are providing feedback on what they have come up with
It is not included 
It is not on the gluten free app so I don't know if it's safe. I am going to pass 
It is not to be labeled as some gluten free alternative. It is the definitive buffalo chicken dip.
It is nothing compared to the amount Auburn paid Scam
It is objectively not a good haircut, but I don't think it's at the level where I am going to scare people 
It is okay. I know it is confusing that I agreed with you for once
It is OTF by default and it hurts me emotionally
It is proper form, however, to go tell Joe to die in a deserted wetlands in rural Indonesia 
It is really early for a Sunday morning wake up
It is so much...
It is still hard to get tested. Olivia wanted to come up to visit in Maine but needed to get tested before she came. She called every testing center around and the turn around time was up to 8 days, but she needed the test done within 72 hours of coming to Maine. It still is not convenient 
It is the second best series based on large heists that I have watched in the last year
It is tomorrow. I just typed the wrong thing
It is too late for the joke, but here it is anyway.
It is true
It is true that I am not religious 
It is true that most things in Arlington, VA are trash, tho 
It is unsurprising that social interventions > healthcare because there is hard data that healthcare only makes up 20% of your overall health. The largest chunk is social and environmental factors.
It is weird to think that people used to feel the same way about the patriots as I do about the chiefs 
It is worse because we are handing him money to get the same production we could get right now 
It is, and it makes owners less willing to sign him 
It is, in fact. I'm hanging out with my other friends at one of their family houses on the Cape 
It isn't
It isn't about deflate gate per say, it's a local writer absolutely trashing on Indy media 
It isn't connecting @Ayatollah Thompson 
It isn't my team, it's OUR team.
It isn't the same
It isn't?
It just confirms our suspicion that he was never actually going to run
It just happened one too many times for me to forgive him. But you're right that all of the injuries he caused we off of legal hits 
It just highlights your superior intellect compared to much of the rest of the US 
It just looks like dead skin to me from the picture. It probably will slough off on its own. It likely won't change the outcome whether you take it off now or whether it comes off on its own
It just updated this morning for Android and it's trash 
It kind of does suck that we can't say Trump anymore without being judged. He ruined that word
It kind of made me erect. Is that wrong?
It literally does not matter. Release the texts. 
It literally has "fantasy" in the name 
It literally lost the Dems an election
It looked eerily similar to 1
It looked like a bad leg kick 
It looked like a garbage pit when I just rode by 
It looked like a man on a platform. But I honestly couldn't tell and thought it was stupid 
It looked like they corrected it after the refs called that extra time out to measure the 2nd and half a yard 
It looked pretty dope 
It looks like a photoshop to me tbh
It looks like both New York teams lost
It looks like it's fighting stuff so I only assumed 
It looks like they were playing in a middle school gym 
It looks reasonable. You can't see The Great Divide anymore
It makes everyone hate me more
It makes me happy knowing that I have the support of a good friend like Joe 
It makes me laugh when they call people like Bocker and me. I can't speak for Bocker, but my occupation through the alumni portal is listed as MD student. Ain't no way they are getting money from me. Go after people like John who own profitable businesses like Kloee
It makes me unhappy. 
It makes no sense to rehash the same arguments every month. The sides don't change and the reasonings don't change. Only reasonable thing is to see what happens at the end of the season 
It makes sense to take them when possession changes or when a team takes a timeout but it sucks when it's 3rd down and someone gets hurt so they have to go to commercial 
It makes you a vagabond of society that doesn't deserve to participate in conversations with those that listen to the good lord 
It may be controversial, but I support your right to celebrate your heritage. We should not disparage the important Chinese figures that have shaped American culture like General Gau and Yao Ming
It may not be the biggest, but certainly the best social progress we've made is allowing cunt to be used more frequently 
It may not have updated but I don't see any FR points for their D on the ESPN app
It me 
It means anything if I help knock you out of the playoffs 
It means I can't get my lattes now
It means that Comey is unemployed 
It means that Darrow just body bagged him on the highway
It means you can apply for them 
It might be more effective to ask Kristen in the Fuck Bock Boi GroupMe, if such a GroupMe existed.
It must be official then. Everyone is free!
It must be pathetic to not be from Boston 
It must be rough having three losses 
It must be so hard being in the United States. I feel so bad for you. 
It must be where the body of the previous resident of this room is kept
It must have been his joke 
It now shows the new picture but it showed 0% of the time for me before he changed it 
It only sent messages to 35 guests. I have no clue how it chose 
It probably won't be live in July anymore
It probably won't catastrophically send the economy into a recession twice, right?
It puts BC on national TV for the world to watch us lose. I would argue that that's pretty bad 
It puts me in the 1-6 PA bracket 
It reads each step to me so I don't have to actually read anything like a poor
It really does make football less enjoyable and more enjoyable at the same time. But it's miserably entertaining 
It really facilitated teamwork. Bocker taught me everything I know about Microsoft Office products
It really is stunning how poorly the Seahawks play against the Rams 
It really is. I didn't see anyone shooting up heroin even once on the blue like. Miles better than the orange line 
It really isn't too much to ask to say "no one commented on this rule so I'm going to put it into effect" 
It really sucks that the NHL playoffs got cancelled because of an international puck shortage. Don't know how this keeps happening to all-time Boston sports teams 
It really throws the defense off guard 
It reflecting how the country should be run as if we were still in the 1700s 
It said Champion in all diamonds 
It said that 33% of black children live in poverty
It says COVID-19 Ag on the left of the test 
It says immaculate right there tho
It seems a little far fetched 
It seems like drug courts are an alternative to jail time. Failure of drug tests or failure to show up to court can get you put in jail. Not sure that's the best choice of punishment but even so, they seem to be effective to some degree
It seems like Japan is saying he's dead and South Korea is saying he's alive and healthy
It seems that there are already cars parked out front so I would park in front of the previous house 
It seems that they were honoring a little boy who died earlier this week
It should be "I've lost a lot of respect...". I started to type one thing and then changed halfway through 
It should be consistent no matter where on the field it occurs 
It should be deactivated 
It should be reviewed from My 
It should taste even better to you knowing that I can't eat it. So fuck you all. 
It shouldn't be incumbent on individuals to not encounter police in order to avoid police violence 
It since has stopped
It sounds like you would not be happy if you continued working in your current job. As Marie Kondo would say, does it bring you joy? 
It speaks volumes about his mental fortitude 
It started to sound like she might have been sitting in the back 
It started when Emyr ditched you and stole all the keepers that were rightfully yours 
It starts by sending Bocker and me $5000 cash in unmarked, non-consecutive bills
It stays fairly stereotypical 
It stipulated differences between keeper value based on whether they were injured, whether they were a free agent or waiver pick up, whether they were dropped and then reclaimed by the same team vs different teams. We discussed it here, goody put a poll up on the fantasy league, and I believe it was ratified 
It sucks out there for old white men. The job market doesn't favor them
It sucks that a Boston hero like Dave Roberts is being held hostage managing the Dodgers
It sucks. Hard. 
It takes 6 seconds. You can do it today
It takes a damn pandemic for construction to stop interfering with Boston traffic. SAD
It takes a lot of stamina to walk 18 holes. Some would call it a marathon 
It takes a real fan to talk to yourself
It takes a real man to take the SATs when you come in last place. Just ask Jordan. 
It takes no balls. My team couldn't even beat a team of Latvian high school students 
It takes over the whole Hynes convention center. Tons of running technology companies, sports drinks, clothing companies, etc. Sam Adams normally has a booth. Just a bunch of companies trying to sell stuff to runners and fans, but it's pretty cool to walk through and see
It teaches children how to overcome challenges in life
It took Jesus a full three days 
It took me 16 seconds to scroll up and find the link. Lazy millennial 
It took me until just now to figure out where this meme was from 
It took you this long to realize that 
It totally made sense to start a Jets running back against what is often considered an elite defensive front (ignoring that Miller was playing the Jags)
It totally makes sense to me that the ISPs are lobbying to end net neutrality to reduce the price for the majority of their subscribers 
It totally makes sense to not have dedicated cameras on the sidelines and endzone lines. Let's just keep depending on shitty camera angles #BillBelichickIsAGenius
It used to be about baking your boss biscuits every morning 
It used to be about football, about the love of the game
It used to be free, back like 3 years ago
It used to be Golden Goal, which was sudden death. But then FIFA ruined it 
It was
It was @Mayor of Pound Town. Get your GroupMe throwbacks right 
It was 0, until I heard that the Patriots all hate each other 
It was 1-0 cubs when I got on the plane 
It was a #Joke that only the real #JokeMaster would get 
It was a 7 because I really had to pee but couldn't leave during the PK but now I have peed and it is a 2 
It was a bad night/party for all involved. 
It was a clean hit
It was a discussion about Frank Cignetti, private eye
It was a dumb word
It was a gay sex orgy in the bell tower. Get it right 
It was a great atmosphere and I would pay money to go again 
It was a little on the fucked up side, but that's normal for you 
It was a long time ago 
It was a lot of work, but this is the image that I isolated from the sunglasses
It was a pretty cool place. Olivia and I brought dinner there tonight. I haven't been there since I was a little kid 
It was a pun
It was a quality gif. 
It was a retarded rule. Basically if a quarterback was aborting his throw and attempting to tuck the ball, if he was stripped, it is an incomplete pass and not a fumble. 
It was a simple incident of mis-speaking while hurriedly trying to answer my good friend Jamie's important and time-sensitive question
IT WAS A SNOW GAME AND WE FUMBLED THE PUNT THAT LOST US THE GAME 
It was a sponsored advertisement to live in Canton
It was a very traumatic experience. 
It was a Warriors game I think
It was absolutely absurd. I really have no clue how he has no one around him on any given play 
It was actually a natural terrorist attack
It was actually supposed to say "blame." Huge typo 
It was actually the fault of all of the above, except Herbert
It was all due to you
It was also a stimulating conversation 
It was also cool for the hosts watching from behind the two east mirror
It was also daytime 
It was also the trip where you guys found out that none of the Fuckholes could be trusted to DD.
It was an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. My understanding is that every country that signed it (which was 195 countries) came up with an achievable goal for their individual country to limit their gas emissions 
It was an empowerment event, more than a protest 
It was an injury on the previous drive 
It was at the very least the first time he had missed in the state of Florida 
It was basically “remember that time I climbed that mountain, yeah that was pretty cool. Let me just rub it in your face again” 
It was big enough that the EM residency director sent us 2 emails and held an impromptu Q/A for all applicants with the department chair and chief residents to explain what happened
It was Billy Barnwell and S\loan Kettering, and they would blaze that shit every day.
It was blown way out of proportion when it came here
it was clearly a misinformed joke
It was cold and tornadoes killed a bunch of people near me. Went to a bar and saw a live band that was actually just a guy stealing cord progressions from 90s songs and playing his own shitty music with rented band members. That's pretty much it. 
It was Dan who said it. Tugboat is definitely carrying water for The Shield 
It was easy to bond over our mutual hatred of joe 
It was either Around the NFL or some random scoop on Twitter. Either way, must be true 
It was essentially the 2015-2016 Broncos. It's your dream come true 
It was fate telling you to spill the beans
It was fine
It was first reported by Ben Volin. Definitely not real 
It was fried-egg shaped lol 
It was funny and ironic at the time but now it's true 
It was funny when Bocker sent it
It was good 
It was good, especially when my REAL friends in the GroupMe texted me to wish me happy birthday
It was great seeing you yesterday 
It was great. Also went to NH. Drove through Franconia notch, then through Grafton State Notch, down to echo lake state park, and over to Portland. Grabbing some take out right now 
It was great. Thanks for asking. 
It was hard, harder than I imagined but bocker tells me that's normal. Just glad it's done 
It was his roommate 
It was in the air for an hour
It was incomplete anyway so it doesn't matter
It was just a good run, Darrow. You didn't miss anything terribly big
It was just confirmed in the GroupMe 
It was just like all the others. /generic jokes 
It was known for hearing fapping sounds and then you crying? 
It was legal. Just can't lead with helmet 
It was like $25 for Halo CE, Reach, 2, 3, 3ODST, and 4
It was like 12 minutes and ended in a field goal 
It was like that
It was lit
It was lit. Denounce. 
It was more of a "your dad is gay joke" because I was insinuating that he was a queen. Looking bad, it was a really poor attempt 
It was more of a way to brag for her that she got into school but then no one acknowledged it because they aren't as good hearted as you are 
It was more recent than Doug Martin's "impressive" season
It was my idea. 
It was my intentional word choice 
It was my understanding that McCarthy was hired because he went on a journey of self-exploration and decided that he was analytisexual
It was night time. I had to recharge my batteries
It was not a bar where you sat down and ordered a flight of cow, goat, and sheep milk
It was not a great day for the family of four who abandoned their seats on the Budweiser roof deck during the sixth inning. Great day for me though 
It was not a waste of 3 hours, but watching it again would be
It was objectively unlit
It was ok. I got some work done, but not much. Got a good amount of meal prep done 
It was on here in FL too. Was watching earlier before I left for dinner
It was on the outside of it. But he thought he poisoned me, just didn’t feel like he needed to tell me until he learned I was going in for an endoscopy 
It was only meant to be scandalous because of my initial thought that she married into Mike's family 
It was our January 6th
It was polio but because of antiWestern trust in the Middle East, its incidence is rising 
It was posted in the groupme that it was ISIS. They obviously know more than the FBI 
It was pretty much your destiny after matching into pediatrics after he did 
It was probably a great tackle and you're a dick
It was probably a you problem 
It was probably the gluten that he just ate
It was quilted northern ultra plush 
It was racist. He literally said there was a huge caravan of cop killers coming to the United States and only Trump will stop them 
It was received poorly because it wasn't good
It was rescinded IIRC
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND WE DIDNT KNOW 
It was Ryan 
It was sarcasm. 
It was second
It was snowing in Boston when I woke up
It was some question that had two choices that were both right and I was saying yes sarcastically 
It was supposed to be last Saturday but she tested positive on the Wednesday before
It was supposed to be rolled out in 2020 but I can't tell from the interwebs if it has been released yet. last update I could find was November and it was not yet released 
It was taghian 
It was that or deadpool, but deadpool was sold out. I'm not big on superhero movies but I think I would have liked that one 
It was the best catch in the history of football until this play
It was the one that came to the table every 3 minutes
It was the top round with sea salt. Also, I have been spelling it wrong. It's picanha
It was the worst proposed rule ever proposed in this league
It was very challenging. I thought it was harder than the practice exams but it's over. Im still sane, so I guess that's a good thing 
It was weird because someone named BigDick joined 
It was welker 
It was when I was in middle school so
It was wild man. You should have been there 
It was worth it because he lives with his wife and they both work 5 minutes away from there
It was your connection to underage women since I now have a daughter 
It was 🫣
It was. Thanks.*
It wasn’t a catch 
It wasn’t a slight. I was using it as a barometer to gauge how frequent Kayla and I talked 
It wasn’t in the groupme, you didn’t driver 
It wasn’t working from the app on my tv. I just started casting from my phone and it’s working 
It wasn't a tweet. It was a screenshot of an Instagram post which was a screenshot of a tweet 
It wasn't a vacation. I was working throughout the whole time. Also not there anymore 
It wasn't an injury. He woke up with "excruciating pain" not related to his calf 
It wasn't bragging 
It wasn't even his pinky
It wasn't necessarily about arguing for more rights. It was arguing to not be put down in society by a president who showed throughout the campaign that he doesn't respect women or people in general 
It wasn't previously in the groupme, therefore it was an original thought 
It went through
It will be a rough look if Boe Jourque or Bocker ever run for office 
It will be a trade-off since Marcus is keeping Darrow's illegitimate child 
It will be extra cool if you tell her favorite band that she has ass cancer and ask them to come perform for her at the chili con carnival, so when they see her crying after eating her parents, they can call her a crybaby pussy 
It will be great lining him up next to Larry Fitz
It will be interesting to see how the next few weeks pan out. Lots of talk about McDaniels staying and not going to colts- maybe an indication that BB might retire soon. Gronk won’t rule out retirement. 
It will be like beating you three times this year when Eli crashes and burns and loses the game for you 
It will come to me 
It will last 17 hours 
It will make your nose look even bigger
It will probably be good for you to buy in bulk since you meal prep 
It will probably just be @Boe Jourque  and me
It will probably just be me
It will start with a couple Instagram selfies. But that's always just the tip of the iceberg. 
It will take at least three more complements to get a like from me 
It will update. Our fascist dictator brought us to a horrible system 
It won't be mentioned, but his proposed budgets have consistently slashed funding for the CDC dramatically. Luckily those cuts have not borne out in Congress, or this would be worse
It won't be until 2021 
It won't happen. We are amassing a clone army (sponsored by under armour)
It won't last until it's judged by the committee, unfortunately 
It worked in the Simpsons 
It would also be the smart thing to do, but according to Marcus, de Blasio would be Hitler-ish to even consider doing that
It would basically mandate that all hospitals have to ensure there is a constant limit of nurses per patients. The limits are set per type of unit. Good in theory, lots of issues with how the law was written in my view
It would be a real shame for the GroupMe elites if I became a member of the intelligentsia and the homeowners' club in the same month 
It would be a shame if his fantasy manager left him on the bench today 
It would be a shame if someone let Pebble Beach know...
It would be a shame if you accidentally booked the same itinerary as me at the same time and showed up in Italy with me 
It would be a true shame if bowl games got cancelled and BC couldn't be the marquee headliner in the AdvoCare V100 Bowl 
It would be an away for EM. Tufts doesn't have an EM residency
It would be better if Horford scored more than 2 points 
It would be classic White Bread to disable the bots without telling anyone out of spite
It would be cool if we stopped them on 4th and 19
It would be glorious
It would be good for him and his family. Gutta support that 
It would be hard to focus on anything positive with all the interceptions you threw 
It would be incredibly easy to corroborate my text thread with KD's phone, which I consent to fully. If I wasn't 100% innocent, I would just fade to the back and not say anything
It would be more fun if we didn't 
It would be nice if companies could try this shit in Boston. All I want is Google Fiber and stores with no lines 
It would be nice if the pattern of spawn frequency changed. Like maybe instead of having all drowzees in Somerville all the time, there could be more variety in what Pokemon where spawning more frequently 
It would be so sick if Bock rushed the Capitol and got shot because the bot circulated the picture of him holding a gun 
It would certainly be better. Not sure I know enough to commit to a more definitive answer haha 
It would go well with our planned 4 OC offense 
It would hard for a female to be a digletter. 
It would have been infinitely more cool to have been in totality 
It would have been nice if Shady pulled his hamstring before he dropped a 30 spot on my team last week 
It would have been nice to have you fly up from Houston for a weeknight dinner though
It would have been really cool if it was open during reunion and they gave alumni a free weekend 
It would have been Wise for him to tackle Ford 
It would help if he was still on the eagles
It would make his wife happy, so it should make him happy too
It would make me happy if we found out in 2 years that Morcus actually ran 6 marathons before he finished with a shareable time 
It would make the ED look like an unsafe place
It would not be silly. The rate is highly dependent on supply. From what I have heard, we are at the point where the feds have exhausted the stockpile and everything that is going out is coming straight from the manufacturing warehouses
It would probably help you on your application. Just make up a story about saving a child 
It would still mean that the USA would lose
It would sure help get rid of a lot of Covid
It would turn into the type of video that ends up on youjizz
It would. I would stay home if I were you 
It wouldn’t make sense to wish anyone a great day. No one else, or should I say, no two other people deserve it 
It wouldn't be invalid if you had access to the email 
It wouldn't have happened if the NBA didn't have like 3 nights in between games 
It you can find one other fuckhole who thinks that the joke was intentional, I will give you $1 waiver wire dollar
It you think my lecturing is limited to just gambling, you are sorely mistaken
It you want to hurt him because he's good, that's one thing. He said he wanted to injure Brady because he doesn't respect him as a tough player 
It*
It*
it*
it*
It’s a miracle he’s at the airport with enough time to actually watch a TV 
It’s a Rick and Morty thing 
It’s a shame you’re not a true patriots fan and can’t watch the game today 
It’s a travesty that the best football player of all time has more super bowl wins than MVPs
It’s a way to possess wealth and move money without being tracked by any existing financial institution 
It’s a zero sum game
It’s almost as bad as planning a golf trip with him 
It’s also a way of exchanging money universally, not restricted to any single nation. Also people like it because it’s safer than paying with your credit card where you can be hacked and have your identity stolen 
It’s an outdoor mall with really expensive stores 
It’s bad that you’re not giving it to me 
It’s crazy that Drake gunna get dinged for Pop not being tall enough to catch that deep ball, so he just comes back to Pop and drops a dime in the bucket
It’s Emyr’s FAAB, not yours 
It’s funny because Joe is implying that Marcus is racist 
It’s funny that Morcus keeps bringing up awards and statistics to try and prove that Delta doesn’t suck. But he keeps forgetting the simple fact that Delta actually does suck 
It’s going to be some BS about his point projections and how unlucky he was 
It’s going very well, thank you for asking, Bocker. 
It’s illegal to prevent a worker in Massachusetts from disclosing salary 
It’s in the GroupMe, isn’t it?
It’s just dudes being bros 
It’s like definitive confirmation that you’re right 
It’s like giving a psychopath the nuclear codes and hoping he doesn’t do something to make North Korea bomb us
It’s like he comes in here just to oppress the other members of the groupme 
It’s like OPP but with trade 
It’s like the nba doesn’t actually matter at all 
It’s literally his job to look at a picture with almost no clinical history and diagnose it
It’s more driven by drug and hospital costs 
It’s more like 7,165,397.44 Yuan 
It’s my daily reminder to go to the gym and lose 15 pounds 
It’s never too soon 
It’s not his fault. Her false started almost every play for two years without being called for it. How was he supposed to know that he couldn’t do it?
It’s not sketchy. Click on it 
It’s not with that attitude 
It’s not YoreMom’s fault that Auburn didn’t teach reading 
It’s not your team, bro
It’s ok Bocker. You haven’t had to take the SATs since high school like some losers in here. You’re a true champion of the league 
It’s ok jordan, we can’t all be fantasy superpowers like @Daz 4 Prez and @ASMB📵 
It’s ok Kovin. People tend to get freaked out and make bad moves when they realize they have to play me 
It’s our gluten free lifestyle 
It’s really taking him twice as long to type this as usual
It’s so great that CSOM organizes these mock interviews for their students. That seems like a great service. Too bad they pair students up with fuckholes (notice the lowercase F) such as you two 
It’s so hard to decide who to start with so many startable running backs 
It’s super weird, but they’re changing the whole curriculum for the class that comes in 2019
It’s the opposite of lit. It’s as lit as Joe at 11 pm on a weeknight 
It’s times like these when we find out who is a real Fuckhole and is Joe Bourque 
It’s weird that even though there are many companies in the area offering different tiers of coverage, costs still continue to rise. I can’t imagine that would still be the case, though, if that’s allowed to happen with ISPs, despite the fact that many areas of the country are serviced by only one company and have effectively no competition 
It’s why Marcus has never come to visit me at school 
It’s with people employed by The Athletic who actually know football and provide real analysis 
Italy 
Italy? 
ITM? Illustrious Titty Magicians?
It's "preventative" in that you are doing it "just in case" you didn't get all of the cancer with the surgery you just had
It's $20, but goody hasn't collected money yet. 
It's @Urdun bin Istifanus al Kalifurnia 
It's 10:05 and she's already on question 10....
It's 12:29, surely Darrow and Bocker will surprise me and show up on time 
It's 2018 and he's on Jon Gruden's Raiders
It's 2020. Do people still use condoms?
It's 6 pm. Let's fuck some shit up 
It's 825 pm right now
It's a 75 minute presentation, of which I am presenting 10 minutes. Blame the four other people with which I am presenting. 
It's a bad rule 
It's a big deal to me 
It's a Big House
It's a bus in Dorchester 
It's a common disease you fucktard
It's a course. One class per week 
It's a cover for 5G, apparently 
It's a depressing class. Basically humans as s species are literally...wait....figuratively fucked since all our medicines don't work 
It's a free country, you're allowed to be wildly incorrect
It's a fucking timeout 
It's a good reminder that men should be giving themselves a prostate exam every week or so 
It's a good thing that we couldn't possibly think any less of you, because that's an embarrassingly bad look
It's a good year
It's a great opportunity to lose in the first round again! 
It's a gym owned and operated by MGH but open to anyone. Employees can either get an unlimited plan or a 10 visit plan. I just couldn't justify playing $30 more per month for unlimited visits 
It's a joke because his name is the underachievers, Ryan 
It's a joke until someone actually tries it 
It's a little early to start thinking about the next MVP. The new league year hasn't even started
It's a little known fact that the antagonist in that song is none other than @#JustFacts✅ 
It's a long walk from Copley
It's a moot point anyway, he's a free agent 
It's a more entertaining, less frustrating, and much quicker pseudo monopoly game 
It's a mostly flat course. As long as it's not pouring, I have faith you can do it. 
It's a nice day for a walk 
It's a pop up axe throwing 
It's a respiratory virus that causes essentially the common cold. Kids are usually exposed to it early on in the first few years of life and it does not usually cause serious illness. But this year, it's been causing pretty high numbers of hospital and ICU admissions 
It's a sad day
Its a self portrait 
It's a shame Hafley didn't get hired in December
It's a shame he hadn't already been added 
It's a shame it was the afternoon game. Should have been prime time
It's a shame that Anthony and Joseph have been asleep for hours
It's a shame that anyone picked a team other than the Patriots during week 1 
ITS A SIGN 
It's a specific type of treatment that you give after you resect a tumor to kill any cancer cells that you might not have been able to resect 
It's a Spirit equivalent. Same level of luxury 
It's a story of wall ball. Becker misplayed a grounder and ran to the wall. Jordan's throw made it before Becker. The agreed upon punishment was to take a tennis ball to the back. Becker argued that he was safe and some say he is still arguing to this day. (From someone who wasn't even there)
It's a strange decision to rely on the Chicago Manual of Style and not Strunk and White for your grammar and syntax advice 
It's a Sunday, don't write work emails
It's a tad late for lunch at this point
It's a tale as old as time
It's a testament to your lack of managerial skills. 
It's a thing 
It's a thing towns do where they let people play concerts on their front porches all across the city. Cambridge and Somerville do it every year Melrose is doing it for the first time this year 
It's a thrilling golf experience. Would recommend 
It's a trick question. College will be free by then, thanks to the Bernie Bros
It's a type of flour right?
It's a very simple question, Andrew. Did you look at the naked pictures of your favorite athlete? If not, can he really be your favorite athlete? 
It's a video 
It's a virus related to smallpox that was originally endemic only to parts of Africa that is now spreading in the US. NYC is a hotspot. 
It's about Peyton manning winning a Super Bowl and then retiring afterwards. You can't say that that would be the perfect career ending that everyone will reference 
It's about time San Diego had their own pro football team
It's absolutely not, but I want to make sure you'
It's absolutely targeting and absolutely should be ignored at this point in the game 
It's actually a malaria drug
It's actually a person who is unhoused. Please use people first language
It's actually a problem. If I don't have podcasts to listen to, I have to actually inject pure gluten into my duodenum to stimulate adequate peristalsis to allow for evacuation 
It's actually atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia 
It's actually impossible to argue with that logic 
It's actually infuriating 
It's all a farce. 
It's all about HIIT now. High intensity interval training. You'll get yoked 
It's all about the suns 
It's all coming back to me now 
It's all good, we needed to trim the fat around here (pun intended)
It's all I use
It's all Olivia and her friends have been talking about. V surprised that you aren't as passionate 
It's all over their new commercials 
It's all paid for. Might as well still drink on her parent's tab
It's all too good to rank 
It's almost as if both sides are manipulating their message to support their narrative 
It's almost as if it never happened 
It's almost as if this show was planned two months in advance and therefore there was plenty of time to know not to commit yourself to other events 
Its almost like that Titans practice that people thought led to a huge team outbreak.
It's almost midnight. Quality of trivia questions is expected to decline 
It's almost punishment for him to win 
It's almost too depression to mention directly so I'll continue to cryptically allude to it 
It's already packed. The minigolf is for 3 year olds, and the line to get in is about 50 people long
It's also a fraction of the cost, looking at it now.
It's also about leaving existing fan bases, spending the money on new infrastructure, relocation of players and team personnel, possible realignments as you mentioned
It's also been in the GroupMe like 14 times 
It's also more fun without fantasy football
It's always a nice story when people set lofty goals and achieve them 
It's always about Bock. No one ever makes it about Joff
It's amazing how much the weather has shifted. It started being terrible, rainy, and cold and now it's getting really warm.
It's amazing that all of this was caused by @Jamie Bourque storming the Capitol
It's amazing that anyone even remembers that ESPN exists
It's amazing. Tom Brady leaves and Joe abandons his Patriots fandom. Meanwhile Goody and I straight texting through the whole game, pulling this bandwagon ourselves 
It's amusing because it's contrary to what I actually believe, thus the opposite of what you'd expect me to say 
It's an actual diagnosed personality disorder 
It's an anti-Semitic chirp, not a gay one. God. 
It's an app that lets you live stream video. 
It's an electronic ticket so no chance it has mrsa on it 
It's an exclusive club 
It's an inferior product with poor coaching and talent is concentrated to ten teams and diluted among everyone else. 
It's an interesting social commentary that I don't know a single male with a Stanley cup
It's as legitimate as your "championship"
It's astounding
It's at my parents
It's bad for our sport and for America
It's bad. Same with doing away with golden goal 
It's basic science. 
It's basically a capital offense 
It's basically an extension of the south shore
It's basically Friday at this point 
It's bear 
It's because he's wearing a shirt of a rival (and better) Ivy League institution. They're probably all upset they got rejected from programs there 
It's because I have no shame in my shitty performances. 
It's because Pokemon sucks now 
It's becoming time for the "get vaccinated by X date or get fired" stuff to come to pass 
It's been 14 minutes. Bocker must have hanged himself
It's been a long day 
It's been all Olivia, her dad, and myself
It's been almost 2 since the first wedding
It's been almost an hour and @Boe Jourque still hasn't responded 
It's been around for a while. I used it when I was a TA at Harvard. They jumped on the situation by giving free licenses to any school that wanted it 
It's been at least 2 years, IIRC
It's been boring as fuck. 
It's been fine
It's been like 3 months 
It's been like this for me for months 
It's been on Twitter for a few hours if you follow any of those Twitter people 
It's been over since McDermott showed the world his gaping vagina 
It's been posted on a few websites, not sure how reputable
It's been proven to be false by several large studies. The supervision in July increases such offsets any decrease in quality of care
It's been rough, bocker, let me tell you 
It's been smoking for the last 16 hours 
It's been the talk of the town for the last few days
It's before work
It's better if you read it yourself. Too much to explain 
It's big on r/memes
It's blasphemy 
It's called a reverse jinx. 
It's called being woke, Anthony 
It's called reconciliation. Bocker is right 
It's called skimming 
It's called trivia crack 
It's cameo. You pay famous people to talk to you 
It's chocolate and caramel. Why is that controversial
It's clearly a flop because he had to explain the joke by putting a caption under the gif, as if we are too stupid to get the reference 
It's clearly the GMs fault. Brown said this week that he had wanted to stay in Tennessee and it's not like he was demanding more than any of the other big name receivers
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
ItS cOmInG hOmE
It's cool though, Olivia is working on the COVID part of her unit today so Seth and I can be COVID buddies
It's cool, he spent all his money on a tiki themed cubicle. He has nothing to steal 
It's cool, I hear we are getting Marty B back
It's crazy because regular season games don't matter 
It's crazy that earlier in the season, the Pats game was pushed back because of Cam. Now they changed the protocols and don't care, or it's a double standard, which blows. The game should be pushed back 
It's crazy that I didn't get invited to the cookie skillet, right? 
It's crazy that I'm literally the best gamer in the GroupMe and Angela still personally banned me from her clash group 
It's crazy that Trump, Biden, and ESPN aren't talking about this 
It's crazy that you still kept him as JJ's godfather 
It's crazy to think about how many offspring Joe must have 
It's crazy to think that Gronk was seeing doctors literally the floor below that I work 
It's crazy what benching your bad quarterback who the defense hates will do for your morale 
It's cute that Marcus and Bocker have phone dates still
It's cute that you and Marcus still have phone chats even though he doesn't have time for the rest of us here
It's Darrow's abdomen after he inserted a PokeBall into his rectum 
It's definitely in the summer 
It's definitely more fun to not know what she sees
It's definitely my strongest personality trait 
It's definitely you and Hackett. I hadn't thought about Wynn since he left the Pats until this game 
It's doing more than the football team is 
It's dumb
It's easier than remodeling my house 
It's easier to eat here than in the US 
It's easier to find a good DC as an OC-head coach than it is to find an OC as a DC-head coach 
Its even more high profile now
It's everything I ever dreamed for 
It's exactly about that. But also the penguins getting murdered. Walruses falling off of cliffs and dying. 
It's exactly how I felt 
It's exactly what I expected. Joe is a known racist and Trump voter (6 times!) 
It's fair because I know you're holding back
It's fine 
It's fine, he's not missing much with the worst season
It's fine, I didn't need that touchdown anyway 
It's for 8 pm tonight btw 
It's for Dovin to say Merry Christmas every year and for Joe to be the only one to respond and for Goody to tell Joe to gobble until he wobbles 
It's for my friend....
It's frequently laggy, have had lots of people have issues connecting/staying connected. 
It's from a reddit thread about jokes you can tell in an interview. Believe it or not, that was the best one
It's from a Will Ferrell movie but I can't remember which one 
It's from all the late night convos we had about coaches during senior year in our mod 
It's fucking ridiculous that there is another star wars moving coming in May. At least try to make them good and not churn then out every 8 months 
It's fucking snowing. It was almost sixty the last two days....
It's fun that it's over. Not that it was a bad rotation
It's funnier when you explain the joke 
It's funny because he is going into radiology 
It's funny because Klobuchar beats her staff members
It's funny because that's this GroupMe 
It's funny because we are making fun of Bocker. Bocker, did you get the joke?!
It's funny because you're joking that he is banging your girl but you're also saying that he hanged himself because you joked that Angela hanged herself after the Bills game Sunday
It's funny how in denial Bocker is about his infatuation with Morcus. 
It's funny how Morcus still wants him to be our coach
It's funny how wrong you consistently are
It's funny that bocker liked the comment about bringing Dovin back when he's the one who kicked him out 
It's funny that poor Joseph even noticed $1700 go out of his account 
It's game day 
It's going to get worse when my new coworker starts work for the summer 
It's going to happen during one of our vacation weeks. But we have a few ideas in mind
It's going to happen tomorrow. I can feel it 
It's golf 
It's gonna be so funny for the Jets when Dalvin Cook is good again on the Ravens 
It's good. It's very good. The gluten free menu is pretty limited. There was some stuff I wanted to try but couldn't. Every bite we had was good, but did not blow me away 
It's goody and me from my birthday BBQ last year 
It's Goody's nemesis 
It's great news, actually
It's great when we are celebrating a top six 
It's great, thanks for asking
It's gutta be that one mountain in North Carolina 
It's Hackett's fault 
It's hard being Joe. Waking up at 6 am. Going for a run. Coming home. Watching reruns of March Madness from 7 years ago. Walking to Whole Foods to get dinner just to find out that the line is too long. Walk back home. Order Dominos delivery from down the street. Have carbohydrate-induced food coma. Go to bed at 9. Repeat.
It's hard for all those trump supporters to caucus with their rascal scooters (I picture all trump supporters as Walmart shoppers)
It's hard for ESPN to report negatively on Peyton manning when they are trying to line up his post-retirement reporting gig. #2cents #IReadAll85Comments #IDontSkim
It's hard to be dirtier than MA's
It's hard to sleep when you see so much red 
It's hilarious how much joy you guys get out of watching a show all about floppy wieners 
It's hilarious how stupid this argument is. It sounds like two kindergarteners arguing over whether the ball was out of the lines in foursquare
It's his group was picture asshole 
It's how I spend most nights eating tacos anyway 
It's in NJ
It's in Rhode island. I'm in Maine
It's in Somerville 
It's in the groupme now so it must be true 
It's in the groupme so it must be true 
It's in the GroupMe so it must be true 
It's in the GroupMe so it must be true. Sorry Joe
It's in the GroupMe, why wouldn't it be real 
It's in the same sentence as the Tyree catch 95% of the time
It's incredible that welled had 8 red zone touchdowns in the first 8 games just two years ago 
It's Instagram. Instant. If you are posting Latergrams, you are on the wrong website.
It's irrelevant, which makes it humorous 
It's it time to.......terminate.......this marriage?
It's just a bunch of kids who look like they're 18 playing unexciting baseball and everyone cums themselves because the 6'2" "12 year old" hit a home run 
It's just a simple pixel 5. Will be 2 years old in October. I've been playing around more with photos and have been using an app called Snapseed for editing. 
It's just not his year
It's just you an me buddy. Bocker was always my friend 
It's kind of depressing, isn't it? 
It's kind of sad that the political party whose accomplishments include creating America and ending slavery is now mocked for "not believing in science" and for dragging its feet on social issues of intolerance. It makes it hard, personally, as a voter to seriously consider any GOP candidate.
It's less funny when it happens to a patriots kicker. 
It's less offensive than Fitzmagic's playing 
It's less useful of an activity when you live with your significant other. But naughty sexting is like America's second favorite past time 
It's like a Joe vs. Bocker trade out here
It's like a metaphor for my life 
It's like an abusive relationship 
It's like bc claiming to have won a national championship before there was even a championship game. Doesn't count 
It's like Damian Lillard doesn't even exist to him
It's like DBs can't even hold hands with receivers anymore. Shame
It's like giving malaria prophylaxis to the doctor doing telehealth from his living room instead of the nurse working on the ground in Africa
It's like he's never done a poll before
It's like it just moves everything through more quickly
It's like last year when another doctor gave me a regular cake for my birthday
It's like musing about a long lost lover 
It's like no one gets how important this is 
It's like restaurants and new apartments and outlets and shit. There is a legoland 
It's like the guy in Seinfeld who became Jewish to make Jewish jokes 
It's like the Vicky Mendoza Diagonal 
It's like these people skim your life decisions, Bocker
It's like throwing a hail mary looking for a DPI instead of trying to win on merit 
It's like two special ed kids beating each other up. There isn't really a winner...
It's like when Gregg Rosenthal said that Patrick Mahomes was "basically a HoF quarterback" during his second season 
It's like when he said that he had worked so many codes in the er that he lost count 
It's like whoever undertakes the role of commissioner suddenly acquires an IQ of 48
It's like wow that doesn't make any sense so now it is funny 
It's like you don't even know me 
It's like, I'm not going to go to Israel and demand that they serve me pork 
It's lit 
It's literally all I will hear about for the rest of my life as a football fan 
It's literally in his name 
It's literally just been me in here for like the last 9 years
It's literally only John and chan. The rest of the fuckholes are still cool 
It's literally the most amazing and freeing feeling in the world to not be one of the billion sheep that listened to a man who drank tea to treat his pancreatic cancer 
It's looking like a good option now
It's Lt. Dr. Kelleher 
It's lucky they are in extras 
It's midterm season!
It's missing it's Oreo 
It's more affordable now because there are subsidies that cover you passed on your income. Those don't exist with their plan 
It's more annoying than entertaining
It's more hygienic, it lowers risk of HIV transmission (I don't think that one is 100% proven), and is used to correct foreskin conditions (I think one is called phimosis, don't know if there are any others) 
It's more than I average 
It's more than I average 
It's my fault guys. I never should have had the photo frames 
It's never lupus
It's nice that @Marcus Bauer is babysitting for Shelbie and @Mr. Large Pectorals tonight 
It's nice that western Mass gets its own baseball team 
It's no The Closer, but it's up there
It's noon isn't it
It's not
it's not 5 pm yet
It's not 80m. It's 80m more than he would get by signing an extension now. 
It's not a listed glade. It's right before the first turn on upper perry merrill at the top of the gondola 
It's not about gaining, it's about maintaining 
It's not all his fault, he does have a camera following him 24/7, and he is a really fucking good football player. I just don't want him shoved down my throat every 2 seconds 
It's not an ivy league 
It's not as fun when Marcus doesn't respond 
It's not cheating or a rule infraction that warrants an 8 month investigation, but it was something that could have decided the outcome of the game 
It's not cool when you do it 
It's not easy because Jordan fills out all of the required forms by hand.
It's not even her bachelorette this weekend....hers is next weekend....
It's not even like he took today off. He would have posted this last night. Which means he worked literally 34 minutes and then just called it
It's not exactly a necessary medical service 
It's not exactly working 
It's not fair for the posa to be decided by a manager refusing to set his lineup 
It's not fair to call Marcus out like that. He's already used up his 5 comments for the day, he can't post any more 
It's not for roofies. It's so the bartender doesn't throw their drinks away thinking they left 
It's not fucking fair that the only week that Jamie actually puts up points, he plays me 
It's not going well 
It's not great but they just got a good amount of snow this past weekend, not that that will really affect conditions a week and a half from now 
It's not in the basic cable package chan, not all of us can afford the premium package 
It's not in the normal context of the joke but I just know before I correct you
It's not in writing. Not legally binding 
It's not like it's beautifully ironic that the team that can't break the 7 win barrier jumps out to a quick lead and then immediately has the game cancelled 
It's not like I've been telling you guys this for 8 years 
It's not like Joff said this weeks ago 
It's not like they're some 10th grader that took a picture for her high school boyfriend of three weeks, who then forwards it to all of his friends 
It's not like you get taken from your last meal straight to get killed. They probably make you wait around a bit 
It's not like you're going to unbuckle while getting an under the table handy at a family dinner. You have to diglett that shit. Same principle with taking a piss 
It's not lost on me that Elon has built companies to combat climate change (Tesla, Solar City) and to advance scientific discovery (SpaceX) which inherently appeal more towards the left but instead he's like naaah just give me those tax breaks and deregulate me bby
It's not meant to be a diet, just a way to find out how sugar sneaks into your diet and what changes you can make to be healthier 
It's not Michelin but it's very very good. 
It's not my fault that I had to do both my job and his
It's not my party to enjoy 
It's not on fire and my blood pressure didn't go up by 60 points just by walking in the door, so therefore it was pretty nice 
ITS NOT OVER 
It's not racist because@ @Skimmer, @The Big Dick Bandit, and @Mr. Large Pectorals are Patriots fans
It's not really "unexpected" when you refuse all conventional medical treatment after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
It's not really a scandal 
It's not that fucking hard 
It's not that I can't, I just don't want to see you 
It's not the end of the month
It's not the hard to not beat the shit out of women. Just don't do it 
It's not the lack of fat that makes it healthy. It's the fact that they have no added sugars or artificial sweeteners 
It's not the place I'd go to watch a game. 
It's not the vaccinated that are taking up beds...
It's not unreasonable to think that if I had started Philly D, Seattle might have defended Larry Fitz and David Johnson well enough to give me an outside chance at an upset. But if ifs were fifths, we'd all be drunk 
It's not your desk. No one cares about you enough to give you your own desk 
It's not your fucking birthday yet Darrow 
It's now turned into everyone not just not wearing the eye protection, which defeats the purpose of having policies 
It's nurses appreciation week 
It's objectively not a pie 
It's obviously a conspiracy 
It's obviously a lie because McDonald's has like 12 locations in each of the major cities in Italy
It's obviously from Aaron Carter's music video for "Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"
It's obviously named after Sir Francis Canadia who was responsible for ridding The Yukon of inuits 
It's obviously not about the pats losing. It's about manning winning 
It's ok because we had Lester 
It's ok Bocker, we're a judgement free groupme 
It's ok buddy, when you lose to Darrow this week and I beat Marcus, we will finish 4th and 5th! Right next to each other in the standings!
It's ok Goody, denial is the first stage of activism
It's ok goody. You can turn it around. 
It's ok TJ Yates. Just getting that pick out of the way early in the game. Eli Manning style. I like it. 
It's ok to skim the other groupme. Here, we should all faithfully read every piece of garbage that the other fuckholes feel the need to write 
It's ok, at least you still have this groupme to make stupid bets about things that don't matter based on 538 odds
It's ok, he hasn't lost anything because he hasn't sold
It's ok, I didn't expect anything of you 
It's ok, I heard that we're signing Rick Pitino 
It's ok, John. Melrose is only 20 minutes away from Union Square
It's ok, the patriots have taken Mike Lombardy from them. So the Browns will only get better and BB will continue to pick players predicted to go undrafted in the second round 
It's ok, we have a great coach who won't let us blow a lead
It's ok, you can have the credit 
It's ok, you were addressing the queers, which I don't identify with, so technically you didn't lie 
It's ok. I ain't mad. He's on the waiver wire 
It's ok. We have a stellar run game that can pick up the slack 
It's ok. We will just work around him 
It's ok. You just wanted it so badly.\
It's okay Becker, you'll get through this tough time 
It's okay Frankie, Joe is very petty
It's okay Joe, you'll get them next time
It's okay you're over 18
It's okay, at least he had BitCoin to buy drugs online
"It's okay, at least the Buccs didn't mortgage the bank to win it all this year, AND give Brady guaranteed money next year, too. 

But Joff, they did give Brady guaranteed money next year. In fact, when Brady retires this year, he will count for $25mil against the cap. "
It's okay, he won't read any of this anyway. 
It's okay, I'm sure we can Wynn with Isiah back at left tackle 
It's okay, it's US that doesn't need THEM
It's okay. I'm sure she'll ask soon 
It's okay. The GroupMe is a safe space to make mistakes
It's on at the bar I am at, but about to leave. Only sort of been watching 
It's on the internet so it must be true 
It's on the tiniest corner of the plaza overlooking Quincy market. 
It's one of the first Voxophones
It's one of those lucky draw things. Monthly $10 promotional give aways. Not an actually certificate 
It's one thing to not be #TeamSoftBody🍩, but it's indefensible to claim to be #TeamSoftBody🍩 while actively making gainz in the gym. People like you make me sick
It's only been 4 2/3rds months 
It's only like a month back 
It's only right for you to set an example and bench him next week 
Its over now but the moderator asked for feedback and called on me when no one answered. Calling on someone during a conference call is worse than treason 
It's partly because of the uninsured but it's a problem for people with insurance too 
It's past Goody's bedtime, kovin 
It's phenomenal 
It's PI in all 50 states and overseas 
ITS PIKACHU
ITS PIKACHU
It's possessive because the Hornet's temporarily owned Jordan's heart 
It's pretty clear that Floyd was picked up simply to fill in for Amendola (and eventually Mitchell) until everyone was healthy. Choosing rapport and knowledge of the system over big play ability. 
It's pretty fun. Not sure what brought it back, but I can understand why people enjoy it 
It's pretty incredible 
It's pretty much just 6 minutes of Bocker and Kristen kissing with intermittent shots of Morcus's face
It's pretty sad even when I'm there 
It's probably a union driven rule. Fuck unions
It's probably because he wasn't a 2nd round pick. If he was, probably would have won the game 
It's probably gluten free too. If you eat it, you might get celiac 
It's probably good you quit fantasy. You'll spend all of your extra time in traffic 
It's probably not a good sign when your train conductor leaves the conductor's area and walks off the train...
It's probably not a surprise that ya boi hates cruises
It's probably possible if you sell your Ronald and Nancy photos 
It's probably something that is only a New England term but since New England is the best part of the USA, everyone else can go take their white elephant, lose my number, and fuck their mothers
It's pronounced Palestines
It's quite alright, the kindness you displayed in offering to bring something is very much appreciated. That extends to kovin and Joo too 
It's raining anyway so their marriage is gunna end in a year or something
It's real depressing in here tonight. I also do not condone assaulting Bock's relatives with your saliva
It's real leaders like yourself who would come up with that solution on your own and clearly without influence from previous suggestions involving the same solution
It's really hard being so good at life
It's s sign. Give up. 
It's sad that Fred Willard is dead
It's sad that some people in here don't think that Joff would drive an hour to hang out with his friends
It's sarcastic because he was on the sox and they let him walk 
It's scientifically proven that gerrymandering is only bad when R words do it 
It's scientifically proven that killing yourself is the only way to totally avoid getting coronavirus
IT's sister died in a car crash 
It's smart of you guys to spend your nights in Las Vegas last. Otherwise you'd blow all your money in the casino before you get to Zion 
It's Snyder's of Hanover you idiot
It's so much less painful 
It's so nice to be able to wake up and not even have to check the scoreboard to know that Kirk led his team to victory against a Cowboys team with a backup QB 
It's so so. I'm a little bummed because they focus 90% on politics and don't really report anything else going on in the news 
It's something I think about almost daily
It's still a 1 score game. That did nothing....
It's still virtual but I am currently in Vermont 
It's stump. How do you not like stump?
It's super bowl day bitch
It's supposed to be a high five gif 
It's supposed to be a more grown up superhero movie. Except he isn't really a superhero
It's technically still ongoing, so this still relate F 
It's terrible 
It's the afternoon, where is our competition
It's the best thing I own in my kitchen (Boos block and Wustof chef's knife from the Fuckholes aside) 
It's the combination of an average apple (macintosh) with the worst apple known to man (red delicious). They are below average 
It's the currency of Macau for all who are wondering. I can't lie, I was scared to Google that at work 
It's the end of the GOP as we know it, and I feel fine. (To be read with the melody of R.E.M's hit song "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)
It's the hip thing these days in the groupme
It's the length it deserves to be
It's the only local gluten free beer. But they don't sell it in cans or apparently growlers. Damn right I'm going to complain 
It's the Patriots 
It's the rhyme scheme. Keep up IDIOT 
It's the right call in the right situation.
It's the same thing as "Brady gets the ball out of his hand so quickly"
It's the second year of the new kickoff rule. Everyone on the kicking team cannot start running until the kicker kicks the ball. On onside kicks, that means the kicking team gets a slow jump on the ball and is at an extreme disadvantage 
It's the splitting a check that's weird 
It's the update that happened years ago. Which we all bitched about at the time
It's the whole ray rice situation over again. Everyone knows he beat the shit out of his girlfriend, he gets punished, and now that there are pictures associated with the incident, everyone wants him punished again 
It's therefore invalid and you have to do it again you scrub 
It's things like this that make me happy to be a Ners fan
It's this attention to detail that makes Darrow a champion and me a dimwit 
It's this the first time that three of my receivers scored above 10 points in the same week? I think so 
It's tiny 
It's tiring 
It's to name a few 
Its to not be a fat fuck and to fit into my clothes again. Obviously I'm not going to remove every source of sugar for my whole life, but I need to get back on track somewhere
It's too bad Jared Kushner wasn't still in charge of middle east relations 
It's too bad Jordan didn't have the foresight to start his new star wide receiver 
It's too bad that BB poached your quarterback
It's too bad that no one has thought of a system where a committee of unknown people sit in a room and decide who makes the playoffs based on a set of criteria unknown to all eligible teams, instead of allowing teams with the better record to automatically earn a playoff birth 
It's too bad that the president doesn't have the authority to fire Jeff Sessions at any moment he chooses for literally any reason
It's too bad that they don't remember Mo Vaughn
It's too rainy for them to refuel planes on the ground so they are delaying all inbound flights by an hour. 
It's too traumatizing, man. I don't even own any spoons anymore. I sold them all to heroin addicts 
It's trending on Twitter. No official confirmation but people in the area claiming it's true
It's true that BC was ranked this year, which is a huge boost to our program but I would not call this season a huge step forward. It just means we got all of our wins frontloaded before the ranking committee saw that we weren't that good
It's true. I felt the wrath all last week 
It's true. This workout got me nice and sweaty 
It's uncomfortable
It's understandable tbh. I'd kill me too if I had to measure up to my accomplishments 
It's unhealthy 
It's unreal that the Texans Dline is getting manhandled in a big game? Tell me more 
It's up for debate like being dead
It's usually thinner 
It's v similar to the many news reports about anaphylaxis with pfiZer and moderna when there were only like 8 cases among 5 million vaccinated 
It's very, very imperfect but the way many insurance companies work now requires people to fail lower cost treatment before advancing to more expensive care, even if the expensive care is more effective. In Goody's case, insurance would usually not cover surgery until something like physical therapy was attempted and failed, or if the injury would lead to severe physical impairment if she didn't have the operation 
It's violent in the way that it's a small world is violent. That's all I know about it 
It's was a well coordinated fuck you
It's way less than six isn't it? 
It's Wednesday at 12:37 pm, and this guy is already talking about the weekend 
It's wednesday before thanksgiving, brah
It's weird that sometimes the GroupMe posts these repeated messages immediately sometimes, but other times it takes a while. Certainly a strange phenomenon 
It's weird that the prosecutor let him off despite the mayor and police chief asking for him to be charged
It's weird that the SEC (reportedly the best conference in college football) only has one team in the top six, but the ACC and Big10 both have two. Not to mention that the Big10 has four in the top 8
It's when a married couple has sex after their wedding to legally bind their marriage
It's where Idaho is and not where the rest of the country is
It's why I hate Dan Shaunessy's pieces and Ben Volin for the globe because they are just meant to stir the pot and don't offer anything beneficial to the reader. I don't learn about anything that helps me appreciate an athlete or football anymore 
It's worse than that because she is volunteering to stay an extra year
It's you 
it's*
It's*
Ive actually been here for an hour. I'm consenting patients in clinic
I've already booked the communist library for my party 
I've already decided I don't care
I've already got a room for the wedding 
I've already had to re-do my CV, submit my schedule requests, upload my social security number, and submit paperwork for my school to sign for my limited medical license
I've already lost hope for this season 
I've already spent my loan money and Bock boi's. Pretty successful if you ask me
I've also become quite* adept at determining his gender
I've also literally never heard that. 
I've always been here
I've always been nice to my good friend bocker 
I've always been on the fence about the "if you're not doing anything illegal, then why should you care" argument. I think of it like if a police officer wants to search your car during a traffic stop, they should have a warrant, but if you don't let them search it you seem more guilty. I just don't know how I feel about that
I've always hated Joe
I've always said "Revere is the NH of Massachusetts," so that makes sense 
I've always said that Matt LaCosse was the next Rob Gronkowski 
I've always said that we were keeping the next Joe Montana on our bench 
I've always said you could trust him as far as you could throw him (not far)
I've always said, the best way to help your rookie quarterback is to get into 3rd and long situations 
I've always wondered 
I've always wondered what it feels like to run into a wall of bodies pushing you back while your Oline is pushing you forward. How do your legs just not snap in half
I've apparently been all about lambs 
I've arrived.
I've attended more bc basketball games than some "fans" here 
I've been 100% in on Kasich ever since Jordan said that he voted for obamacare
I've been assured that that won't be an issue and that the mph classes are more seminar based and not really real coursework. I guess I'll find out in a year 
I've been at conference since 8 am and then work until midnight right after this so I'm not coming through for the boiz today 
I've been at work. Every time I get a chance to look at my phone, you guys have already solved the next riddle! 
I've been denouncing LeBrom before it was cool
I've been driving since 130. I did not eat lunch. Can confirm that I am very grumpy 
IVE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME AND DIDNT JUST GET HOME FROM WORK
I've been humped against my will by @The Big Dick Bandit. Does that count?
I've been hurt before by a good friend who claimed to have a threesome in the McElroy bookstore but was found to be lying when he could not provide proof. I am simply trying to maintain the integrity of the GroupMe
I've been in a different state. Ain't no chance my girl is still my girl
I've been in a spiral of bad customer service over the last week. Olivia and I stopped to get Chinese food when we drove home from VT last week and our order was missing stuff. Then last night, I ordered sushi to pick up on my way to work and when I got there, the restaurant had a sign saying that they were closed for the week (but their own website's ordering portal said that they were open). Now my barber is 20 minutes late for my appointment and I have a meeting to get to and am going to have to leave. 
I've been in line at Wegmans in Medford for 35 minutes and moved up 10 feet. They've let about 4 people in the store since I've been here. What is this, NYC?
I've been in right field with my hand up
I've been more disappointed in you before, but this is up there
I've been naked and staring at your picture of Nancy Reagan for the past 9 hours. It was awkward when you didn't notice me this morning when you left for work 
I've been on a pastrami and swiss kick lately. Not sure why
I've been on strike for years
I've been on that moonlighting grind all night. On the fourth call, bringing a friend to @#JustFacts✅ 
I've been on the list for years 
I've been once in my 2.5 years 
I've been reading the Bible a lot recently
I've been saving up on common Pokemon and candies. I have a few more to catch before it's worth it but I think I'm almost there 
I've been saying it for years 
I've been saying it for years 
I've been saying that for years
I've been saying the same thing for years 
I've been seeming that all morning. Sounds like the guy who burned his IT jersey should probably think about buying a new one 
I've been stashing that $25 I saved from our league for tickets 
I've been there the whole time
I've been threatened with withholding of certain pleasurable activities if I watch the rest of the season without my significant other, and thus have not finished the season 
I've been to both Bryce and Zion, but not since I was a kid. Seattle would be cool. 
I've been to Louisville once. Nice bats there 
I've been to six annual seminars 
I've been to their house. I've made buffalo chicken dip in their oven. 
I've been told elective surgeries and outpatient clinics are going to try to get back to normal after may 18th as well
I've been told for years that no one needs me so this is a normal feeling 
I've been training him to attack while you've been gone 
I've been very consistent too 
I've been wrong about every timeline prediction I've made so far. I'm probably the last person to ask about that
I've busted at this point
I've Cold Turkeyed social media and forgot to add the GroupMe to the list of blocked sites so you are my only source of entertainment
I've come to the conclusion that every halftime show is bad, no matter who is performing. Ever since jt/Janet Jackson, they've all been downhill 
I've coughed like 6 times over the past 3 days so I am pretty sure I have the 'rona and Kovin is a bitch
I've cut Marcus's lead down from 70 points to 65. I'm still in this 
I've decided I will engage no longer in this discussion, which is below my intelligence level
I've decided that I'm retiring my team and joining Darrow's as comanager. 
I've decided that someone broke into Patrick Chung's home and planted cocaine. No way he'd ever break the law 
I've decided this very second that he should run for MA governor
I've done it a handful of times, only in the raunchiest of bathrooms. If the place looks clean, I'm fine 
I've enjoyed the Kevin and John time that has had a chance to flourish today 
I've flipped to the Michigan/nd game twice and both times they have been stuck in an official review. 
I've found a disturbing lack of females our age. And almost no one is as attractive as people in Boston are. That said, we've only been here since this afternoon and have stuck to mostly touristy areas, so that could play a role
I've gone full bandwagon on the Bruins. 
I've got a great best man speech ready for your wedding though 
I've gotten all my jobs without a recruiter 
I've had a few people on social media wishing themselves happy mother's day. 
I've had at least 2 interns tell me this clerkship that step 2 was way less stressful 
I've had at least three talks in the last week about physician burnout and the high rate of physician suicide so imma take the money and not kill myself 
I've had it on in the background. Have heard the praise but didn't see anything to make me think he was lighting it up
I've had people telling me that for years. Definitely not the same. Example 1: joe Bourque can skate, ask him about his skiing. 
I've had the game on for two series and have seen more play action than all of last season 
Ive had the game on in the background and wasn’t paying attention. Did Hurts get benched or hurt? 
I've had to listen to Bocker verbally fellate the office all week. At least the third time I'm hearing of this  
I've had to say a fun fact like 3 times and the "randomness" is not working because I've been paired with the same resident 3 times and the same applicants multiple times as well 
I've had two running backs leave the game with injury 
I've had two Saturday interviews. VTech last Saturday, Drexel today 
I've heard good things about Pittsburgh 
I've heard good things about season 3
I've heard Gronk is probably not going to be traded now because of this 
I've heard him compared to a more skilled Danny Woodhead 
I've heard it's really good. What do you think?
I've heard that biden has Florida in the bag 
I've heard the "Trump is going to piss everyone off and no one is going to want to help him" song and dance before 
I've heard you should refinance with SoFi
I've invited you all to throw axes on Saturday. So far no one has bit 
I've learned that time frames are more meant for the bosses reviewing and not the worker doing. I've written two drafts on manuscripts for publishing. One has been in edition stages by my boss for 4 months. The other in editing stage for 3 weeks. Each paper took me two days to analyze and write 
I've learned this week that memories suck. Sure you look back on them fondly, but then you get sad that that time has passed and that you didn't do enough to cherish it in the moment 
I've literally been lovingly calling Marcus my turkey since the day we met. Who does she think she is, coming in and stealing my nickname for him? 
I've literally been rioiing all day
I've literally been saying for 3 decades that Lebron is a hypocrite 
I've literally been saying this for years and yet some people in the GroupMe would rather fly Delta
I've literally never had a JetBlue flight cancelled or missed a connection
I've literally never heard anyone say that. 
I've literally never heard of that person
I've literally never noticed that restaurant on my app, but yes, apparently it is
I've literally never run a 400m in a time competition above 60s
I've literally never seen Penn State lose a game. I feel like the only losses that happen there are children's virginities 
I've literally not seen a single one of those posts 
I've lost interest. Going back to work.
I've lost three starting running backs and Jordan trade raped me. I deserve every win I don't deserve
I've made it for plenty of events that you chose not to attend
I've narrowed it down to about 69 suspects
I've never actually had Moogy's but I knew it was pretty popular
I've never been because my people aren't welcome there 
I've never been profiled due to my race, ergo, not racist 
I've never been wrong 
I've never been wrong about Clowney and Watt once 
I've never cut into a living person, but I'm sure surgery isn't that high-pressure
I've never even heard of the place. I always go to Erik's
I've never ever received a fake email ever. 
I've never had a bad sports take in my life 
I've never had a cream filled bunny
I've never had a pink lady but hear it's the shit 
I've never had my buffalo chicken dip disrespected like that before. How dare you
I've never had such a weird combination of arousal and GI distress at the same time as when I looked at that picture of Goody
I've never heard of it, it hasn't been reviewed. I was planning on bringing my own Thai food so don't worry about me
I've never heard the term cobra effect 
I've never left you off of a list ever 
I've never loved John more than this moment right now.
I've never participated in a community day and I don't plan on starting 
I've never really paid close attention to any elections before this. Is there normally such a stark dichotomy between urban and rural counties? Normally I just hear about differences between states. The CNN map last night was crazy 
I've never received a spam email from them 
I've never run a marathon but 20 miles seems a bit long 2 months out 
I've never run more than a 10k so I'd consider myself a strong contender 
I've never seen @Beanboy and Al Gore in a room together at the same time 
I've never seen a double penalty like that 
I've never seen a healthcare themed presentation less than that...
I've never seen a more staunch BC football supporter than Anthony "Tony" Goodwin
I've never seen a single GoT episode and never read a book. I have been told by others not to start the series because the ending was so awful 
I've never seen a video of Joe eating a medium rare steak while being interrogated about it's taste posted in the GroupMe 
I've never seen anesto and Bocker in the same room together 
I've never seen anyone disparage @#Just📠✅ or @bockbot in this GroupMe 
I've never seen Bocker and Messi in the same room before...
I've never seen cricket but marble racing is my real expertise
I've never seen Goody be wrong 
I've never seen so many delay of game penalties on a team in a season
I've never seen so much news coverage for a 3-5 inch snow storm. Half the state was closed before a single fucking snowflake fell 
I've never seen them both together 
I've never seriously considered going there and thus have not researched the awfulness of the country 
I've never shot over 70 in a round of golf
I've never signed up for a race (end sentence, haha) as a group 
I've never skimmed
I've never sucked Tom Brady's dick. Your argument is invalid 
I've never tried it. My assumption is that you'd get more flavor but I'm not a big proponent of raw spices on my meat 
I've never understood people who pull out their laptop on the t during rush hour. Someone on my way to work yesterday was on their laptop and someone on my way home is on their laptop now. You are either going to or coming from work. What is so important that it can't wait 20 minutes til you get home 
I've noticed that Bocker has stopped posting his bitmoji after I made mine. I can only assume that I killed his hopes and dreams and ruined bitmoji for him forever 
I've noticed that girls think wahlburgers is the shit and guys think it sucks. I need to prove statistical significance with a larger sample size 
I've noticed that I get a lot of shitty comments on popular threads when I'm not signed in 
I've only watched the pilot so far, which was pretty good, but a ton of people have told me how good "You" is.
I've personally seen Kevin performing surgery while responding to groupme messages. We all make sacrifices 
I've personally taken care of and heard about too many patients that have terrible care/outcomes at Women and Infants, which is really the only OB hospital in Rhode Island. 
I've reached my terminal argument and I stand by it
I've read all of those books except the last. Don't have any clue how the series ends. I'm a horrible person 
"I've recently become a fan of 
/r/natureisfuckinglit"
I've run that race three times. Have never trained for it. Always regretted not training. Be able to run six miles before race day. 
I've secretly been living in the Denver airport with the lizard people too
I've seen a lot of graffiti that says "fuck 12" in the DC images. What is 12 and why is it being fucked? 
I've seen all I need to see. Celtics in six. 
I've seen enough. This is what we get in Trump's America 
I've seen John say it a total of two times. This now marks the second time I remember Becker bringing it up 
I've seen LeBron rooting for OSU. ND by a billion 
I've seen some comments on the ol' Tweet Machine from people saying that it shouldn't take a national racial justice movement for companies to realize that their brands may be racial insensitive. While I understand where those people are coming from, I think these companies should be recognized positively for making a change that is sure to incur an increase in expenses, at least temporarily while they rebrand and alter marketing strategies.
I've seen that face before. That's his "I'm about to eat your ass with a spoon" face. Watch your back Becker 
I've seen that too. One method that is commonly used is to vaccinate a mix of patients in different hot spots and see if they become infected. The downside of social distancing and falling case numbers is that the likelihood of naturally running into the virus decreases. So clinical trials that use this approach could take years and years to get enough data that support or refute efficacy. That leads into the idea of purposeful exposure
I've seen the same 46 views of Moraine Lake from 46 different accounts since coming home from Banff 
I've seen what I need to see. Mac is not that guy 
I've stumbled down a rabbit hole 
I've subscribed but haven't gotten to listen to any yet. Glad to know its good  (provided that's the one I'm thinking of)
I've taken myself out of the running
I've talked to at least a dozen people who have seen the movie and no one has told me that they liked it. Yet everything I have read has said it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread 
I've told him at least 50 times. 
I've traced the shooter's original location back to this patch of grass
I've treated two whole patients with CVST so I basically am an expert 
I've tried one. I have had many regrets.
I've tried to add him. It keeps not letting me. Don't know if I'm just mentally handicapped or if he blocked the group? Is that even possible? 
I've tried. I get a stern email if I work any more than 32/week 
I've upped my renumeration rates. The Joffy Finance lifestyle has be used to living a life of luxury, but currently down today 
I've wanted to go to the Griffith Observatory but haven't had the time yet. The Getty is great, and I bet the Getty Villa is too. The Misfits Restaurant and Bar, The OP Cafe, and True Food Kitchen in Malibu are all regular spots for me. They get non-gluten free social media love so I assume they are good for you people too.
I've watched a few other shows that were okay. Severance was good. The After Party was enjoyable enough 
I've watched it all the way through twice. No recollection 
I've watched it the last few weeks. It's not bad, but it is not the medium through which I like to consuming ATN content.
I've watched the whole stream since T-8 minutes. The CGI of Earth looks really good. We've definitely made advancements since the moon landing was staged.
I've yet to see any crown princes wielding falcons
Iverson?
Ivory ran all over the pats a couple years ago 
IYKYK

Jackie chan was the better Asian movie star 
Jackson 1324
Jackson definitely showed how overrated he is on that play, right @#JustFacts✅ 
Jacobs has had terrible ball security 
Jagr
Jags 
Jags are going to be a playoff team this year. I'll bet Becker's lunch on it 
Jags basically kidnapping Coen to get him to sign
Jags center tore his labrum in his hip. Going on the PUP and having surgery 
Jags checking into the conversation 
Jags' decision to trade for Carlos Hyde stemmed from mounting frustration inside the building--and particularly among coaches--about Fournette's prolonged absence. Built the offense around him, hamstring issue continues to linger
Jags gunna jag 
Jags lost their 7th rounder due to an Achilles year. Someone needs to investigate why their camp is killing their rookies 
Jags!!!!
Jaguars defense might be the worst unit in football 
Jaguars look good today
Jagz last year 
Jahvid Best doesn't think so 
Jakarta?
Jake Brisket 
Jake Brisket and Jimmy G helped us win the #RevengeYear SB
Jake Brisket is a little.....over cooked 
Jake Briskett 🐐

Jakob Ingebrigtsen 🐩
Jakob Johnson going to IR with a shoulder injury 
Jakob Johnson, Josh Gordon, Ryan Izzo, Matt LaCosse, Patrick Chung, JC Jackson, Devin McCourtey. All been hurt in this game. 
Jakobi is great. He'd be a great 3rd/4th on my team, the 9erssss
Jakobi is great. Wish we had a receiver like him 
jakobi meyers > prime jerry rice
Jakobi Meyers and Danny Dimes gunna be in the same HoF class. 
Jalen Hurts isn't an NFL quarterback 
Jalen Hurts. I always said he was the best QB in Alabama history 
Jalen Mills is terrible 
Jamaal Charles at least scored a touchdown 
Jamaal Williams is a better running back. Don't @ me. 
Jamaica? DR? Haiti? Bahamas? Cuba? 
Jamal Adams to Seahawks 
JaMarcus Russell 
JaMarcus Russell signs with the pats as backup qb for first four games. Book it.

Jamie and I are great friends. I would be honored to spend a few hours with him at such a rousing sporting event. 
Jamie and I*
Jamie and me have a pretty legit matchup right now 
Jamie Bourque are you rooting for Kirk or BoChangles Nix (From a Middle Class Family) 
Jamie Bourque congrats on the pardon
Jamie Bourque disappointing.
Jamie Bourque good looks, friend. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness and taco bell 
Jamie Bourque must be conflicted 
Jamie Bourque sometimes comes here to shit on Bocker too
Jamie Bourque what? Michael Penix did not look good 
Jamie Collins is God 
Jamie Collins up there for best athlete
Jamie CoLOLins
Jamie Dickerson is the be all, end all of that list 
Jamie Dickerson. He's good at everything 
Jamie didn't even know he wasn't in the groume...
Jamie figured that out faster than google 
Jamie gets richer. 
Jamie has finished
Jamie how come they didn't interview you for the teacher appreciation thing?
Jamie is a baller
Jamie is a genius 
Jamie is already Joe's slum lord
Jamie is definitely Ozai. Doesn't appear often, but when he does, he's ragging on everyone
Jamie is not included in this list.
Jamie is raping me with his Vikings D 
Jamie is smart enough not to vote for tebow 
Jamie is still in Mexico I think. He probably won't answer 
Jamie is you dad at the game?
Jamie liked it. Just waiting on joe 
Jamie might kill himself if that happens 
Jamie must be so mad right now, and he has no idea why
Jamie opted not to take them and to remove himself from the league 
Jamie really mad about Joe Milton
Jamie refused to check the groupme for months except when he needed something, then blindly added Marcus back without even asking the rest of us why he was removed in the first place. Also, he had to have done something on his end to make it impossible to add him back
Jamie repeated one of your answers. That doesn't count as correct 
Jamie should have held out longer. Parks closing for the coronavirus would have been a good excuse 
Jamie, I could have kept you well fed. You should have come over 
Jamie, I'm big on both Russell Wilson and Tyler Lockett. Since you have both, 100% chance you win the championship 
Jamie, this portnoy-volin debate is awful. I hate Ben Volin's writing. I think he's the worst pats reporter in the business. But this is an all low for him. Just a bad look. Portnoy sounds like a genius compared to him 
Jamie, when you murder Joe, are you prepared to pay his half of the mortgage?
"Jamie: public school, ended racism, owns Accenture
Joe: private schools, believes in Q, doesn't wear masks, trying to murder my in laws
Goody: private school, sells discount khakis"
Jamie? 
Jamie's arm strength routine 
Jamie's entire team plays at 1 pm today. Can't remember the last time that's happen 
Jamies Winston does not like morning football 
Jannu Smith is trash. Send him back to the Titoons

JBoss 🐐
JBoss 🐐
JBoss 🐐🐐
JBoss, a viking helmet, and lack of cell service 
JBoss, are you coming to lunch/dinner on Saturday 
JBoss, don't lie. You love us more than Bocker loves disappointing Jordan. 
JBoss, hate to call you a skimmer, but goody posted the link to the keeper list literally three posts before you asked 
Jboss, how did you get all the brains and talent and Patriots fandom and good looks while your older brother was left with nothing?
JBoss, we can start our own fantasy league, with blackjack and hookers 
JBoss, weigh in on Billy's vs Kelly's 
Jboss....
JBoss🐐
JC fucking Jackson
JC Jackson doing everything to prove why BB was wrong to burn the bridge with Gilmore 
JC Jackson is the best corner in the league/Harmon is the best safety in the league
JC. He was from France 
JD Drew 
JD Drew 🐩
JD Vance is a great pick, I loved Catcher in the Rye 
Jed York doesn't seem good at his job. 
Jed York got asked today if anyone higher up than the GM should be removed from the team. I feel like that should be a legitimate option. 
Jeep going hard against the coastal elites. Time to short
Jeez, the state of the union is this late? No wonder RBG didn’t want to go 
Jeez. You've floated the idea of working for ESPN and interviewed for a job at iHeartRadio. You sure know how to pick your companies...
Jeeze even when Chan is on the list, Jordan ignores him 
Jeeze Jboss....
Jeeze that dude is glass 
Jeeze Tony, not that hard.
Jeeze, I have been winning so much that I have neglected "woe is me Joff"
Jeeze, read your audience
Jeeze, some friend
Jeff 
Jeff = ^
Jeff Fisher has won more playoff games than I have.  
Jeff Green has played for 11 different franchises, but 12 teams if you include him moving from Seattle to OKC when the franchise moved. And he had two different stints with the Celtics 
Jeff Green is still in the league?
Jeff Green old as fuck
Jeff Howe called him the “bridge” LT until we get a draft pick groomed 
Jeff Howe: "worst object on the field since^"
Jeff just worked a 24 yesterday so he's a little shook

Jeff Sessions vows to restore independence and professionalism to the justice department. Contemplates special prosecutor to investigate Obama's justice department. Promptly requests resignations from 46 attorneys

Jeff Smith was lined up against from a DE on that 1st down play. Need to recognize that and exploit it 
Jeff 🔥🐳
"Jeff: John left the league because he isn't a football fan

John: I'm a fan, just not as big as you guys

Also John: I don't know the name of one of the most famous receivers in the league, who was a valuable commodity while I participated in the Fantasy League, and I also do not consume sports content "
Jeff: mozzarella
Jefferson country is 48% in and Jones leads 67k to 12k

JerBear and Danielle? 
Jeremy Hill to the Pats 
Jeremy is more patriotic than Marcus. #boldclaim
"Jeremy went to BC with us/you. He was in Eagle EMS, but was a huge EMS hardo (whacker, in industry lingo). He went to med school, did an emergency medicine residency, and then has done two separate fellowships so he can work in a surgical critical care unit despite him not being a surgeon. 

While in medical school, he enlisted in the military as an officer but has famously never been in any combat or active duty zone. He flies on some helicopters and wears a uniform and makes it his identity. At my wedding, he told @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) that he was not as advancing in the military as fast as he should be but could not even remember his own company’s name."
Jeremy, Brandon, and Lianne 
Jeremy? 
Jerk. 
Jerking off on the subway platform
Jerkoffs? Don't talk about jerkoffs. You kidding me? Jerkoffs? I just hope the niners can win a game 
Jerod Mayo is now the keyholder 
Jerry Jones is probably hoping Dak gets hurt so he can put in Romo 
Jerry Jones might be the best GM in football. 
Jerry jones says that he regrets not drafting JFF, but he'd have to trade for him unless the Browns cut him. Which it makes no sense to cut him if the Cowboys want him, because then they could work out a trade so they get something in return 
Jerry needs to retire
Jerry Reese canned 
Jerry rice? 
Jerry Thornton agrees with me. You are objectively wrong
Jerry Thornton lied to me. 
Jerry Thornton, for what it’s worth, has said that Butler was benched essentially because he not only sucked in practice, but was also flipping out at coaches and seemed relatively unstable 
Jerry York.

Jesus chan. Fucking ruin my night why don't you 
Jesus do you really want Morcus on any jury with you?
Jesus doesn't love them

Jet blue literally won't let me come back to Boston. Which one of you guys is paying them off

JFF
JFF came to Wednesday practice drunk. Team lied and said he was in concussion protocol to protect him 
JFF is digging himself in a pretty big hole. Throwing a rager, not showing up for treatment, and having Browns security have to come to his house to drag his ass out of his house 
JIIIIIIM
Jill = masturbation hand. 
Jim Caldwell said lions were expecting the packers to run a lateral play. If the entire viewing audience, who in comparison to NFL coaches know nothing about football, expected a Hail Mary, how could the lions not? They had two corners sit on either sideline to make sure they didn't try snd run it 61 yards into the end zone. And then they just let receivers get in front of them in the end zone. Not to mention it's highly debatable that they didn't out Calvin Johnson, their best receiver, in there to knock the ball away, but I guess why would you if you are too fucking dumb to expect a lateral play when Rodgers can throw it into the end zone 
Jim Christian shouldn't even be allowed back in the locker room. Send him right out to his car with a pink slip

Joe is dumb
Joe is embracing his new wilderness lifestyle. As in the lifestyle of a serial killer who has to escape to the woods of New Hampshire and hide out in a small tent in the middle of the wilderness to avoid detection.
Joe is encouraging a shitty individual to be the worst version of himself. What a surprise
Joe is fully on this train 
Joe is giving up a bad QB for a relatively good QB. Kovin has no way to claim that this trade benefits him other than he neglected to pick up a starting QB from the waiver for like 6 weeks
Joe is just a great manager. Stop trying to discount his success. You should take a page out of his book if you want to win a championship 
Joe is just a smart manager who makes useful, informed decisions for his fantasy team and would never do anything just to fuck with another league owner.

Joe was always the real commissioner 
Joe was literally never my roommate 
Joe was never my friend 
Joe was the keeper of the 🐐 list. Every person or thing that was referred to as a 🐐 in the GroupMe was added to the 🐐 list. At one point, we held a march madness style tournament to see which 🐐 was the 🐐 and each side could list their arguments before we had a Groupme wide vote. Unfortunately for Goody, Andrew Jackson (whose racism and brutality to IPOC I denounce) clearly defeated Nomar 
Joe was too embarrassed to be filmed
Joe was waiting for days to post that. Had that line duo 
Joe watching AD is sure to revive his #JokeMaster career 
Joe way to not start Jackson 
Joe what are you doing over there?
JOE WHAT KIND OF SORRY EXCUSE FOR A GROCERY STORE CLOSES AT 7 PM
Joe why don't you ever bring me bread 
Joe why don't you have a mask on
Joe why don't you just give bocker your Twitter account info so he can see your feed there instead of in the GroupMe 
Joe why the fuck were you up at 4:50 am

Joe would rather go hang out with anarchists in Catalonia 
Joe would want you to have more compassion
Joe you better break your phone before an independent investigator tries to read through your text messages to find evidence that you conspired to lie about keeping your conversation secret

Joe, as a ghost writer for BCI, how do you feel about their posts that contradict this statement? The ones saying that Jim Christian is all but fired?
Joe, can you remind me what four muscles are considered part of the rotator cuff?
Joe, congrats for once again being able to participate fully in fantasy football. I know you couldn't handle the pressure when you were applying to grad school, but surely you can now that you've been accepted 
Joe, does it make you proud or sad that you're literally the only person on the planet who cares about BC basketball without being paid to care about BC basketball
Joe, don't feel like you have to abide by the rules of the patriarchy. You can go into education or nursing or being a fluffer if you want 
Joe, don't let the facts get in the way of a good story 
Joe, FaceTime me when the Zags lose so I can see your tears 
Joe, fix @joffbot plz
Joe, give him that L again 
Joe, go back to work 
Joe, going to need you to do what I couldn't. Put up 150 
Joe, gonna need you to take the fall for AB. Won't hurt your record too much with that dui
Joe, goody and I both thought the same thing, so obviously that's the right answer. We wouldn't both remember wrong 
Joe, Hitler is dead. I can see that MC education really payed off for you 
Joe, how did it feel to almost 2* a th12 
Joe, how do you feel about Jordan throwing you under that bus?
Joe, how many times have you gone to take a piss and walked back into a meeting with a top executive to find out that your shirt is now wrinkled because you untucked it and ruined it? 
Joe, I can almost guarantee that Becker would agree with you. Isn't that reason enough to change your opinion? 
Joe, I cannot come today. I will be there in spirit
Joe, I clearly said "Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette 🐐". Not "Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de Lafayette".
Joe, I don't know why Becker is taking out his anger on you. Keep doing you
Joe, I hope you're happy with the monster you created while Darrow trusted you to run the league. 
Joe, I just want you to know, I still pay attention to you even though you're an awful human
Joe, I resent that mean comment you made to my good friend Bocker. You choosing not to care about someone who is such a great person is just proof that you're a terrible person.
Joe, I still don't understand how you put up 170. My team can't even consistently hit 100
Joe, I still have some downeast from what you brought to my apt a couple weeks ago. Let me bring the rest of those for you and then I got a bunch of other stuff I can drink too 
Joe, I think your team is splendid 
Joe, if Goody has been mean to be, it's because I deserved it.
Joe, if you can survive through the winter, you’d find some great deals in March or April. I know that puts you out a lot of money during the winter so you can rent, but just my 2 cents to go along with Bocker’s 2 cents 
Joe, I'm sorry that you're on the T. I am too also on the T as well 
Joe, it is way too late for you to be awake. What has B school done to you?
Joe, just because you escaped the ghetto that is Wakefield doesn't mean that I can't taunt you when your hometown gets its nuts kicked in 
Joe, just want you to know that it's not Sunday 
Joe, make sure you check in wth your buddy. Conor McGregor vacated his featherweight title (not posted in groupme, therefore not new news), so goody might be making a trip to the Tobin 
Joe, not Jordan 
Joe, on Sundays, this room is reserved for Patriots circle jerks and Joff complaining about his fantasy team
Joe, one could argue that you only know that because you went to a good business school. 
Joe, post the fat person weight loss photo please 
Joe, Ryan, and John, how is Jay? I hope you fellas are having a great time. 
Joe, send me your Uber tracking so I can make sure you get there 
Joe, stop buying in. You're wasting your time by paying attention 
Joe, tell us 
Joe, that may be true. But Fitzpatrick threw four interceptions to knock the jets out of the playoff picture last season. Definite 🐐
Joe, that's why you never listen to doctors and refuse to get yourself or your children vaccinated
Joe, the fight is at midnight. No way you'd stay up for it 
Joe, there are products called biosimilars that are hitting the market soon. Literally molecules that are biologically almost the same as a drug that have the same effect. I think the first one for pediatric IBD is being approved and it's going to cut the costs markedly. One Infliximab infusion can cost anywhere from $5k to $13k depending on your medication dose and your weight. This will either out compete the company that produces Infliximab (Johnson and Johnson) or force the company to lower costs 
Joe, they would have lost 
Joe, this isn't your Twitter timeline 
Joe, trade me Bortles. He's my spirit animal 
Joe, want to move in with me in Southie when you get stuck coming to Boston to work for GE for the rest of your life? You and I can even share a room if you'd like 
Joe, we had watch parties in our 8 man junior year while you were in Spain. I assumed you attended virtually 
Joe, we’ve noticed you didn’t join us at Chan’s 
Joe, we're done. He asked for one answer. 
Joe, what are you en route to 
Joe, what happened to Beleskey? Wasn't he touted as a high profile free agent? Now he's only playing because of injuries? Is he that bad now? 
Joe, what happens when Julianne beats you 
Joe, while I don't support your right to trade with someone else, I would appreciate you giving me your best wide receiver for Carlos Hyde. That shouldn't be an issue, I'm sure
Joe, why are you up so late
Joe, would it be too much work for you to make note of who nominates each 🐐 going forward? That way we can bitch at the right person for nominating a shitty 🐐, and can also keep track of who is allowed to rescind their 🐐 nomination 
Joe, you can chirp me when you add my 🐐 to the list. You clearly skimmed over the message from last night. 
Joe, you could always move back to Stamford 
Joe, you haven't sent me the money for the Red Sox tickets you're using to bring goody to the game 
Joe, you should apologize to Troy Brown for forcing him to share his birthday with you 
Joe, you shouldn't hate NFL players without a good reason 
Joe, you spelled "your" wrong. Big L
Joe, you're a skimmer 
Joe. 
Joe. Cut Gronk. Do it or you hate the Patriots.
Joe. Get drunk more often

Joe. Stop being a hater. 
Joe. Stop indulging him in golf conversation. 
Joe. When are you having a housewarming party? I want to come trash your apart..... I mean I want to come celebrate you not being.....I mean come visit!
Joe. Why didn't you mention that two of my players that scored 13+ were waiver wire pick ups?
Joe. You’re bad at fantasy. Focus on preying on other people with no brain cells 
Joe. You're a poor now. Poors don't read the WSJ
Joe: all I do is write down who people say are 🐐s. You don't write it, I don't add them to the list 
Joe? I was talking about Kovin and Nock
Joe’s got a lot of hammer-head-hitting to do between now and Thanksgiving 
Joe’s such a great friend, isn’t he.........
Joel Ward 
Joe's a hater.

Jordan, will you grade papers for me so I can watch the game? 
Jordan, you'll be happy to know that Trump made it into my reproductive biology lecture. There's an evolutionary reason why he's a major doucher apparently 
Jordan, you're a liberal now. Don't call your brothers blow hards 
Jordan, you're looking at this all wrong. Those 0.3% plus 1% of all people (representing SJWs) actually collectively complain more than 95% of the population. Therefore, they are in the right and your opinion and wrong and bigoted you selfish pig 
Jordan. 11 times
Jordan. Stop making up lines. It's not real. 
Jordan. Why weren't you here. 
Jordan. You're mean. 
Jordan/Emyr and Joe, come help fight my battles for me and knock these people out of the playoffs 
Jordan: "Hey hot girl. Want to give me a prostate exam with your tongue?"
Jordan: Director of Accounts Payable and Asset Management (I'm just going to pick something that sounds like it would be appropriate for someone who works at banks)
Jordan: I saw you guys posting repeatedly about it months ago, but I was in the process of uploading my post. Takes a while to think of a witty comment. 
Jordan?
Jordan’s home team team has been so bad that he doesn’t understand rivalries between teams anymore 
Jordances with Wolves, how did I do?
Jordan's a chicken! Chicken! Mooo! Mooo!
Jordan's last comment is literally the extent of what needs to be said on the matter. 
Jordan's players have 10 touchdowns compared to my team's 3
Jordan's report*
Jordanzer and I went ham on the Thompsons
Jordanzer on a scale of 1-10, what's your pee level for the next four years 
Jordanzer, great job totally pwning base 6 in our war today. 
Jordy is a fraud compared to Kaptain Kirk
Jordy Nelson is related to Admiral Nelson, who makes a really shitty version of Captain Morgan. We should only be supporting Captains, so vote for Captain Kirk
Joseph Bourque does not care about people with black avatars. 
Joseph Bourque never came back to argue his point. Even if he is still at work, his boss most certainly isn't.
Joseph I am surprised you enjoy a beer that doesn't come in a blue can 
Joseph I believe the fighter jet was probably for the navy vessel they are commissioning today\
Joseph 🐿
Joseph, I created fitness Fuckholes (later renamed to Fuckswoles) as a way to discuss strategies to being healthier with my good friends, and to avoid h8ers such as yourself 
Joseph, I don't think Old Ironsides has TVs. It's a pretty old ship 
Joseph, I respect your opinion. Thanks for sharing.
Joseph, I see you came in fourth place in our other league, despite you being the first seed in the playoffs. Must be painful to have such high expectations and still lose 
Joseph, is this your first viewing of The Town 
Joseph, register for the webinar and you'll find out 
Joseph, thank you for the suggestion. However, I will have you know that I do not respect you enough as a person to take your advice. 
Joseph, that's very insensitive. Think about all the student loans for which he has to pay.
Joseph, you are welcome to come over whenever you'd like after 5 pm. I really don't care how early/late. Like I said, I should have plenty of food and the roof deck is pretty sweet today 
Joseph. That's rude. 
joseph.f.bourque.tu22. What an email 
Josh Allen is a little whiny bitch 
Josh Allen somehow had an ok year, and then a really bad year and still moved up the draft boards
Josh Allen was drafted last year #jokes
Josh Allen. Book it. 
Josh Brown placed on commissioner except list. Sources saying he'll never play on the NFL again 
Josh Gordon
Josh Gordon 
Josh Gordon 
Josh Gordon doesn't come back to the ball on a long throw where he is wide open. Then he doesn't get set. Not a good look
Josh Gordon failed another drug test a month ago, which is why he hasn't been reinstated 
Josh Gordon gunna be benched for a few snaps for being late 
Josh Gordon is back!
Josh Gordon is good at football 
Josh Gordon should really come grovel to Zappe to revive his career 
Josh Gordon.
"Josh Gordon: suspended 4 games after definitively failing multiple drug tests; can be at the team facility and meet/practice with teammates because of how the rules for substance abuse suspensions are written

Tom Brady: suspended four games after maybe, possibly asking an equipment manager to make footballs a little softer; can't even text his teammates or play catch with them at his house without getting games added to his suspension"
Josh Hawley is a dick muncher 
Josh keeps vulturing from Cook
Josh normal is playing very week against Thomas 
Josh really sticking it to the league for spurning him this offseason after he tried to fuck over another team
Josh*
Journalism is in a bad place. I haven't seen anything published on the #ThristTrapShooter
Joyless Joff would probably say something right now like: I can't believe that Trump is encouraging protesters armed with assault rifles to liberate their states because their second amendment rights are being threatened.
JR refers to Joffrey Romulus-Mithell-Carter-Ali-Lee Savarino

Jstew :(
Juat like the Zags beat a 9 seed who lost to BC this year 
Judge 
Judge and LeBron both signing with the Red Sox 
Judge sucks, Devers is great. 
Judging by her pictures, no 
Judging my darrow's record, I don't think he's reaping many benefits 
Judo, which is a form of jiu jitsu, is an Olympic sport 
Judon bicep tear 
Judon lucky he didn't get a bullshit blindsid block penalty on that return
JUDON. MARCUS JONES 
Juice is the BC band that got mildly famous
JuJu go poo poo 
JuJu was basically raped before that ball got there 
Jul 21-23
Julianne finished with 4:44.44. What the fuck 
Julianne is going for UGBC president. Then she's targeting Father leahy's job 
Julio actively trying to prevent Darrow from getting any more points 
Julio jones is on the official team of the Fuckholes 
Julio Jones is the worst best receiver in the league. Just catch the fucking ball 
Julio Jones: 4 catches for 87 yards. All of his catches were fiercely contested. Pretty good job covering him 
Julio laying it all out there to save me from losing 2 points
Julio's real first name is Quintorris. That's unbeatable 
July 16?
July 30th through Aug 2nd
July 4-9
July 6th and 7th are our hiking days 
Jumbo Dong 
Jumbo Dong Martinez 
Jump up and down for me 
June 18th
June 2020 you mean? 
Jung is giving us a good talk about how communism is bad and young people suck 
Junior year 
Junior year, I unilaterally got to decide who got a scholarship from Monserrat to enroll in the EMT class. I was drunk with power 
Junior year. Scheduled a cab three times. First time, picked me up perfectly. Second time, went to the wrong address, didn't see me, took another call. Third time, went to the wrong dorm, picked up the wrong Jeff. 
JURGot to be kidding me
Jurkovic? More like JERKovic
Just @Vic Changio  and @Skimmer  in Boston proper. Looks like even the Fuckholes are segregated
Just 8 more Raiders added to the Covid list 
Just a couple jigglypuffs near the common 
Just a few years ago, a home game was pretty much a guaranteed win for Seattle. Obviously different without fans but the luster has faded away 
Just a quick aside for a personal rant. I got prescribed a new medication that requires dose escalation. My insurance company forced me into purchasing a 90 day supply of the medication, even though I would be changing my dose after just a few weeks. So both the insurance company and me had to pay twice as much 
Just a reminder for anyone in Boston, you are still all welcome to come over to watch the game today. I have plenty of food. We accept small and big ballers alike.
Just a reminder for everyone that I hate Tom Brady
Just a specimen of grace and intellect 
Just a thought. Maybe the hospital cafeteria shouldn't be showing "which president added the most to the national debt" on all of the tvs 
Just alter it a bit afterwards. It won't be as egregious as chan's bracket 
Just an Elmo head 
Just an excuse for pundits to make money 
Just an open invite for Frankie...
Just another celebrity pretending to be hacked when he posts antisemitic messages on social media  
Just another example of Cory Davis letting every single person down
Just another list Chan is left off of
Just another Marcus who had overstayed his welcome
Just as described 
Just as good as Jordan's political insight 
Just as I thought, silent
Just ask Aaron Jones about what fumbling on the first play in the 4th quarter does to your team 
Just barely 
Just be careful when you sign up. MassHealth overarching type of insurance but you can sign up for many different plans. The different plans are administrated by each of the different major hospital groups and you're confined to seek non-emergent medical care from whatever group you choose
Just be happy you guys aren't invited to the shower 
Just be thankful you're not on welfare like some members of this groupme (cough @#JustFacts✅ cough)
Just because a medical condition forces me to adhere strictly to a certain diet doesn't make me unable to recognize when shitty food is shitty 
Just because goody is a fucknutter, no bobbing for apples tonight. Thanks a lot goody, you ruined it for everyone 
Just because he died after having cancer, we are supposed to forgive all his sins? 
Just because health 20-30 year olds don't go to the doctor doesn't mean the entire population can do without doctors
Just because the authors stand by their findings in the wake of intense criticism doesn't make their findings right.
Just because there wasn't corruption in this pool doesn't exclude corruption in the other pool 
Just because you edited a Wikipedia page doesn’t make that #JustFacts✅
Just because you made a graph with squiggly lines doesn't make it true 
Just because you propose, doesn't mean you have to get married. Just ask @The Big Dick Bandit 
Just because you're mad at me for making fun of your people this morning doesn't mean you have to be a jerk 
Just bought HBO Go subscription
Just by that preview graphic alone, NY gunna get fuuuuuuucked 
Just came out of a funeral to a post about Jesus Walks. Very appropriate 
Just chance your name. They won't know it's you 
Just checked two minutes ago 
Just checking in at the gym so the GroupMe knows I'm putting in the effort 
Just chillin with my homies
Just circling back to a previous issue brought up by my good friend Bocker, it's a little mean that Drachman told the GoT GroupMe about this skate trip across Barcelona without even bringing it up here 
Just clarifying that there is a distinction between legalization and decriminalization
Just closure of non essential stores and businesses that were mostly closed anyway
Just completely unblocked on the left 
"Just confirmed. 
Tournament of stars round 1: champion
Tournament of stars round 2: lost in finals
Chopped Ultimate Stars: lost in the first round "
Just consider them all wins for America. Just like Olympic medals. 
Just create a league and assign players to each team 
Just curious. Didn't know if there was anywhere else around that did it. I went there to tube in high school 
Just demanding attention and shit 
Just did 
Just discovered a typo that I'd like to fix. "If the NBA shut down tomorrow, I literally wouldn't care one bit"
Just dissecting some uteri. Don’t mind me. 
Just diversifying perspectives 
Just do what everyone else does and start your own business 
Just doing whatever the fuck he wants to and getting paid $114 million to not record a sack 
Just don't jump in front of traffic when you realized you go to bu AND you lost to me 
Just don't show the pet rock a male jesus 
Just don't study 
Just don't tackle Edelman. See how that works. 
Just don't use the bathroom without paying for something 
Just downloaded a 41 hour audiobook on the rise and fall of the Roman empire. Part 1 of 3 
Just elect him to the hall of fame now 
Just finished 
Just finished 
Just finished Better Call Saul. 
Just finished it
Just finished season 1 of the rehearsal 
Just finished watching that. I don't have anymore clean undergarments
Just fixed the government 
Just for me 
Just for the non-NBA followers of the group (not me of course), could you specify what the salary of a max contract looks like and indicate how many players can be on max deals while still fitting under the salary cap 
Just for you goody 
Just found a Barry Bonds rookie card. I'll sell it to you for $500k @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco 
Just found out that Julio Jones ended up being inactive despite reports this morning that he was likely to play 
Just found out this morning that the AAMC is recommending that all residency interviews be conducted virtually 
Just fucked the Saints out of a defensive touchdown
Just get a job there real quick and happen to work in the department reviewing own occupation disability insurance applications and just happen to get assigned my case file 
Just get them busted for using steroids then
Just getting 7-8 yards per check down/dump off. Hard to get them off the field when they are getting first down after first down 
Just getting pelon. Be there in <5
Just give him or her some bleach to drink
Just go for whatever company has the biggest signing bonus, start drinking at work, and the time will fly by 
Just go to google and search blue waffle. You won't regret it 
Just going to point out that I pointed out chandler jones's injury in real time. I'm basically Twitter doc 
Just gonna hold this for a bit 
Just got autism
Just got home from there, nothing too too rare but I caught my first sandshrew and machoke and a bunch of other uncommons
Just got home from work. It was fine
Just got home. Fun fact, Massachusetts "randomly" decided that I have to send in all of my tax documents for the whopping $200 refund I got back 
Just got this too. Today is a good day
Just got victory royale in solo
Just grilled and ate a whole branzino without swallowing a bone. #BuiltDifferent
Just gunna get ahead of the joke here: no wonder why she bought Darrow a father's day card 
Just had a dope ass run as the imposter. Feels good to be the king
Just had my first phone interview for jobs next year. Three more on the schedule for now. 
Just had someone leave their lunch in, only to come back to find it cold and that I had taken it out. So now she's passive aggressively standing here waiting to use the microwave again after I'm done 
Just hand that off to Cook at the 1….
Just hang out with Joe. Goes from New Hampshire, to Vermont, to Massachusetts and is now combining three households. 
Just have it be Apple devices only. They don't have a built in backdoor to access 
Just have to be able to put all the pieces together against a team that has strengths up and down their roster 
Just have to get on the Joff diet plan. I can teach you to my healthy if you want
Just heard that American Airlines is banning emotional support goats from their flights. Looks like I'm boycotting AA
Just him generally being an annoying douche 24/7
Just hope by the time they have to intubate you, they have enough ventilators.
Just how it works 
Just imagine being Joe
Just imagine what would have happened if Jack Easterby, character coach expert, wasn't there to encourage good decision making 
Just in case you forgot how the game ended Chan 
Just in case, I picked the Ravens. This is my written evidence if Joe fucks with my pick again
Just kidding 
Just kidding Joe. I love you and hope you are having a great day 
Just kidding Jordan. Love you man. 
Just kidding, happy for your goody! I look forward to thoroughly vetting her 
Just kidding. I am currently reverting PALS and getting ready to give my last M&M tomorrow 
Just know I love you, even if I don't show it
Just know if you ever need money Goody, I can take out more loans if you promise to never come to my medical practice and ask me to look at a "lump" on your balls 
Just knowing that you're my friend already makes me fly 
Just landed, let me just read through the GroupMe and check the score. I am sure we are keeping it close 
Just landed, reading through the chat now 
Just laughing about it again
Just leave it at that
Just leave the FROG posting to me, Darrowball 
Just leaving me and BoChangles Nix off of the steak making list 
Just left for my dentist appointment, but it was nice and quiet before I left. Didn't have an annoying coworker bothering me every 30 seconds. 
Just let CeeDee trot in wide open
Just let them die 
Just like a load bearing wall that we absolutely wouldn't tear down to create an open concept space 
Just like BB should have won coach of the year like 15 times 
Just like Bocker paying the Jags to inactivate Fournette today. Thanks Bocker, you made my running back decision easier this week 
Just like cam newton 
Just like ESPN's fantasy projections, that number will never be met 
Just like every year 
Just like every year since half life 2 came out 
Just like everyone predicted 
Just like Gary cohen 
Just like goody voted for Trump 
Just like he fixed Kristen's super bowl squares 
Just like he has a hard time beating me in fantasy 
Just like I left the GroupMew
Just like I'm the part of mine that nobody likes 
Just like Joe and I predicted 3 weeks ago
Just like Joe last election cycle, twice!
Just like kickers
Just like LeBron 
Just like making a health care worker put gloves on for your rectal exam
Just like Morcus won't pull out 
Just like old times 
Just like one of my sunny days 
Just like politics 
Just like R Kelly, I'm reporting that Trump is also stuck in a closet. 
Just like sophomore year, right Kovin? 
Just like Spotify with Kendrick or Mel Kiper Jr with every shitty prospect 
Just like that Navy seal had a lot of integrity 
Just like the Capitol rioters were false flags by Antifa to make people hate the Republicans
Just like the giants were
Just like the hopes and dreams of 49ers fans 
Just like the NFL exploits servicemen and women and cancer survivors 
Just like the thirst trap shooter
Just like the world didn't see the German invasion of Belgium coming
Just like throwing a penny off of the Empire State Building and getting groped by a guy in a costume in Times Square 
Just like Vince is sneaky fast 
Just like Vince Wilfork is sneaky fast 
Just like when everyone said Pablo Sandoval reported to spring training down 20 pounds and he was actually just fatter 
Just like when he kicked out Dovin 
Just like when spent his whole life trying to prevent Brady from going to super bowls, now he has to do everything he can to try to get Mahomes into super bowls 
Just like with the bots
Just like you couldn't look up restaurants for this weekend. Smh joe 
Just like you got into the seven other schools at which you interviewed 
Just like you stopped using the GOAT list
Just listened to it. Couldn't disagree more 
Just listened to it. Far inferior to JaJa Ding Dong
Just look who they hired to do the interviews
Just looked at the World Series score. The cubs are fucked! 
Just looked it up, never have seen that before 
Just looked up the two characters, Dany. 
Just make sure Ryan doesn't steal your gold or a pound of flesh while he's over there 
Just makes sense to let the gondolas paddle right through the water bus stop 
Just making sure that the zoom is still running without me there 
Just means that neither of us can get knocked out 
Just means that no one knows how to score
Just met Tom Brady on his day off 
Just met yolanda's sister 
Just Morcus? 
Just more evidence for goody
Just more time for you to get paid to jerk off and not play fortnight with da boiz
Just need Maine Med to accept me then it's all moot anyway
Just need the Texans to win tomorrow 
Just need two more offsides kicks and two touchdowns. Those extra 8 points earlier in the game definitely would not have helped now 
Just needs a rinse under some lukewarm water 
Just not sure I understand why Bocker told you he would be in NY for your party if he was gunna come back to Boston 
Just noticed that he's opening the fridge to get ice cream, not the freezer 
Just once, if my players were to actually match their predictions, I would be so happy
Just one month, currently at the end of first year; will be at the beginning of first year starting in 2019. And it's still in the realm of medicine, just more about social determinants of health and stuff
Just one more point that the pathway to many PhDs is incredibly hard and I couldn't even begin to fathom how smart Beanboy has to be to defend a dissertation on his chosen topic. PhDs are experts in some of the most niche fields and are responsible for driving scientific research and the advancement of so many disciplines. I have nothing but respect for those who work that hard. Just don't call yourself a doctor when talking to patients 
Just opened up PokeGoBoston to see a dragonite disappear 5 minutes away from my apartment. #suckstosuck
Just parked at Bennett and are walking over. Fuck you and your parking 
Just passed a 3 year old with a handgun
Just passed the Department of Education 
Just passed the Patriots busses heading to TF Green. 
Just pathetic 
Just pay for your wife and have her pay next time 
Just pay the child support goody. It adds up and you'll have to pay back all of the months you're hiding in Mexico 
Just piperacillin? No tazobactam. I see you like to live dangerously 
Just post which course and what time you are going to book before you book it. I'm not going to steal your tee time or anything
Just posting these here so we all remember these takes as the rest of the season continues 
Just putting this out there, I would be willing to do a Jamie/joe-like trade for lesean McCoy for some good keeper value 
Just ran into the one and only Posa 
Just read it 
Just read SBN like jordan if you want to feel like that 
Just read that no one showed up to Blaine gabbert's press conference today because the team forgot to put the event on the media schedule. 
Just realized that #41 is Cyrus Jones. Did not know he came back
Just realized that February doesn't have 31 days. That joke went way over my head 
Just realized that Fournette got ejected in the 3rd quarter. I'd like those lost points back 
Just realized that kovin also lost shady for the game
Just realized we didn’t give Joe enough shit for turning the groupme on mute today 
Just realized, Thursday will be the third time this season that the Chicago bears will be playing in prime time. 
Just remember that Joff hates LeBron. LeBron stans for China. The WHO stans for China. Joff hates the WHO
Just remember that you uninstalled groupme and then bombed your exam. We're good for your grades. 
Just remember which GroupMe member was talking about potential mutations before a different strain of the virus was even mentioned in the news.
Just remember who should have been asleep but was awake and here for you
Just remember who stood with you till the bitter end
Just remember you lost to me 
Just reminding everyone what today is 
Just rent out JJ 
Just re-read the ruling. It was actually a "suggestion to implement when practical"
Just resigned Harmon. 4 years 20mil
Just rewatched it on HBO while I was sick 
Just rub some dirt on it. You're fine. 
Just saved the schools a mili 
Just saving time. But if we can all get there at like 9:50, we'll be set 
Just saw a commercial for a movie where JLaw is playing a Russian spy. They couldn’t get a real Russian woman to play the part? Fucking cultural appropriation 
Just saw a story on Metta World Peace. He's gutta be that old 
Just saw Darrow drive by trying to find parking 
Just saw my first reception that Gonzalez gave up on the saints final drive
Just saw replay. Wow. 
Just saw that on reddit 
Just saw that the field at this stadium is rolled out before every game. Very cool! 
Just saw that too
Just saw the 3rd down play
Just saw the Capitol news. Awful
Just saw the hordford slam. Beautiful 
Just saw the replay. 100% a foul based on the rules of basketball, which are dumb 
Just saw the saints/packers score 
Just saw the score. 95-51. That's like uconn women's lopsided 
Just saw this on Reddit. Can someone post in the girl's groupme about the gender gap in education in Europe???
Just saw Trent Williams went to the Nerssss
Just say "noticed this was wrong, here's what it should say"
Just saying, every position takes a ton of skill. It's a misnomer and it's dumb 
Just search for him by Chris
Just send her@King Of The Bourques 's address
Just shoot me an invite
Just shoot them down and pretend Ukraine did it. Seems easy
Just show them your flip trick moves 
Just showing up clearly out of shape and unmotivated 
Just sign your kid's life away for a paycheck, Nate.
Just slightly better than the team with which he colluded 
Just snagged a major table inside. Back bar 
Just so everyone knows, the deed is done. Commissioner goody informed me of my right to cancel my scores. Which I have done. Now I wait for an uber to take me to campus 
"Just so I am caught up to speed as to what is going on: I knew about the balls to the face incident and the subsequent response from UT to do nothing and the dismissal of the lawsuit. I knew manning wrote negatively about the trainer is his book and she sued him again, and they settled and required manning to avoid talking about the situation. That's all old stuff.

The new stuff is that females (female athletes?) at UT are suing the school for promoting a culture where sexual assault is forgiven and goes undisciplined. And in response to that, this author King wrote an article saying that Manning's legacy was essentially a lie since all of his transgressions were swept under the rug. Is manning now suing him for defamation of character?"
Just so you know Marcus, I go back to school the first full week of August so you're really pressing your luck with these August dates 
Just something comfortable. There isn't anything intensely physical. I'm wearing jeans 
Just spent about two minutes trying to find it, only to realize I didn't have the update yet 
Just stalk his social media account and see where he checks in 
Just start jacking off when you don't have work to do
Just start showing up to press conferences and talking shit about both fighters. That's a good start, I'm sure nothing will go wrong 
Just started watching Space Force. Anyone seen it yet? 
Just starting it. Will let you know my opinion 
Just staying busy working. People never stop dying
Just stomp on our hearts why don't you
Just subscribed to the "Pod Save America" podcast. I'm 30 minutes into the most recent episode and they've spent at least ten minutes dumping on Marco Rubio despite the entire podcast being about the executive order
Just taking a break from the normal csom circle jerk 
Just taught my friends about roast beef sandwiches. They are not impressed. I need new friends
Just tell him you don't want to hang out 
Just tell me what time to get there and I'll be there 
Just tell them to fuck off and worry about what's in their own glass 
Just that I didn't feel like I lost out on anything with having 5 people 
Just that they were Craigslist roommates and the landlord has had to mediate arguments between them as if they were teenage girls 
Just the boost we need boiz. Let's get at it 
Just the goat glades were off limits 
Just the headline, so its pretty much like an original thought
Just the oldest, whitest person? 
Just the player. Not their defense 
Just the things Joe does today? 
Just the thought you you enraged me 
Just think about this: at least you don't do crossfit. 
Just think of all the traffic with everyone trying to leave the stadium at once
Just think of your job as a way to save up enough money to change careers. If you tell yourself it's only temporary, you won't be depressed about it. Trust me, I know science and stuff 
Just think, Bill Coughlin is gunna be trusted looking in some vaginas and putting his hands inside unconscious people
Just think, if we had beaten Purdue, our own loss would be against a ranked opponent without our best player
Just think. The Browns had both BB and Saban at the same time. Saban gets more wins in a season than the Browns have had since then 
Just thought the real ones would know 
Just thought the same thing 
Just thought you should know 
Just thought you'd feel personal anguish for them 
Just throwing picks 
Just tired from sleeping in and napping all day. My life is very taxing.
Just to be clear, Christopher Alden is a fucking moron. I was sarcastically posting someone's serious tweet
Just to be clear, Christopher Alden is not a moron. I was seriously posting someone's serious tweet
Just to be clear, I am not joking 
Just to be clear, I denounce klan talk 
Just to be clear, I denounce rape and support collectively bargained labor agreements 
Just to clarify, I have a clan and I denounce klans
Just to clarify, you know it’s Michael Rapaport and not Ian Rapaport, right? 
Just to clarify, your fiancee is a rich rich. You are a parasite 
Just to confirm, because I am a piece of shit and a bad friend, is Julia the same girl you went to Rwanda for, or a different girl?
Just to confirm, you are referring to the toilet safety administration?
Just to confirm: keepers are $10+ what is shown here (no keepers >1 year)
Just to make y'all feel worse about not voting. The line to vote in my voting center is out the door, to the street, and around 1/2 of the school. The neighborhood is skewed to a younger generation but most people here are in their early 20s. Go out and vote you buffoons 
Just to recap: run all your searches through google; host all your websites and make all purchases through Amazon; buy all your coffee from Starbucks; delete uber and use Lyft. "Vote with your dollar," as Mr. Goodwin always says. I'm sure doing all of that will do wonders to stop Trump from incompetently ruining the government /s
Just to say hi to your friends who were visiting NYC
Just to spite joe 
Just too many big plays happening for them to show
Just try to fucking put it in play 
Just trying to be economical in Biden's economy
Just trying to get a guest star spot on yours and Prima's DIY show 
Just trying to prevent Chan from rage quitting the groupme 
Just turned level 10 yesterday. Pokemon are stronger. Chan confirm 
Just turned the Clemson game on. Lol. 
Just turned the game on after that last bc touchdown. Looks like it was a fun half
Just two bottom-half franchises pretending to be relevant 
Just wait til Becker wakes up 
Just wait til I drop you by .4 after both our teams characteristically underachieve 
Just wait til I get the Thompsons diagnosed with celiac. 
Just wait til Ollie joins the Celtics 
Just wait until he demands power rankings 
Just wait until I beat you in a completely meaningless game for me this week 
Just wait until I tell you that we drove to Vermont for these flights because the direct flight from Boston was $700/person and the flight with a layoff from PVD was $850/person 
Just wait until John sees this...
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until you find out them is actually a he
Just wait until you go 0-2 against me this season 
Just wait. I'm volunteering at a soup kitchen, adopting three dogs, and housing a refugee family all before Sunday 
Just walk around with a typewriter and an axe. What could go wrong

I want to get one of those high end fashion mannequins grab them by the ankles and bash your ribcage in.

I want to sharpen 5 pencils, bind them with a rubber band, put the lead in your mouth and punch the erasers.

I want to strap you to a bead of nails then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car so I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps on a mall parking lot during an earthquake.

I want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and somehow not survive a small fender bender on the way back from the hospital."" -Bo Burnham"

Kevin, can you casually slip into the admissions office and look through my file and found out if I got in or not. This whole "waiting until November" thing sucks 
Kevin, I am going to respectfully defeat your team in our healthy competition this week.

Kraft can't be racist. He called a time out to hate 
Kraft finding another random high school team to fly somewhere to make up for how bad his planes suck 
Kraft is a piece of shit
Kraft is delusional
Kraft is right that Mayo was put in an impossible situation. He was hand selected years ago, promoted without a true hiring process, and given the responsibility of leading a barren roster that had over performed defensively due to the preceding coach being one of the best defensive minds that has ever graced football 
Kraft is so fucking cheap
Kraft made it a point to announce his high expectations after that game ball ceremony too 
Kraft says Brady told him he's willing to play for another 6-7 years. 
Kraft subbed from the HoF again l o l
Kraft will find a drug that keeps both of them at their current ages forever, preventing the need to ever retire

Kyrie doesn't want to sign an extension with the K's this off-season because if he waits a year, he's worth $80m more. If I'm Trader Danny, I'm getting this guy on the market yesterday and trying to trade him. Ain't no way I'm forking over that money next year

Lamar asking for the playclock to be reset for no reason after a normal down
Lamar Jackson has to be out of the Heisman race after that loss
Lamar Jackson is a secret genius. Can't truly assess if he's better than Flacco if he doesn't have the ball in his hands. That's why he fumbles 39 times/game
Lamar Jackson is getting more points. Don't know what you guys are talking about
Lamar Jackson is washed up. 
Lamar objectively has improved his passing game across a full season sample size. That's not negligible. He's clearly better than Hurts, no question. 
Lamar Odom 2.0

Lance grilled Marc on one pick. Marc's support for the pick was "he felt Lions-y". Lance made fun of him for that. The Lions picked that player 
Lance Zierlein came on to the Heed the Call podcast to criticize Marc Sessler's mock draft (most of the criticism was a bit). Marc famously does not spend more than a few hours on his mock. Marc was more accurate than Lance, who gets paid specifically to make these mocks every year

Last summer, on like.a 95 degree day, Olivia had an appointment at a salon that did a temperature check. She had to walk like half a mile by the time she got checked. She registered as having a fever. The salon told her, "oh lots of people have had high temps today, so we figure it's due to the weather. Come on in"

Last time we were here together you were wiping tears from my eyes as Olivia walked down the aisle 
Last two are quarterbacks 
Last week when I was on call, we had to do a procedure on the floor that required masks and eye protection. This was at like 11 pm. In the afternoon that day, the nurse manager had taken all masks from the floor and put them in her locked office because employees and patients had been stealing them. We had to go to another part of the hospital to get what we needed 
Last week, one of my co-residents got an eerily similar text from a dude she had previously been dating. They weren't even together anymore 
Last year, first seed picked
Last year, we used our Aero Garden to grow starters for our garden. We had so much growing in our garden and then a groundhog and our dog destroyed it all except for the tomatoes 
Last year?
Last year's posa teams had great regular seasons this year. Goody managed himself from 9th to first seed. I managed myself from 10th to 8th. Real strong work from two up and coming teams 
Last? I’m sure they won tonight

Laughable to think you could put the two on the same playing field 
Lauren and Sam? I vaguely remember them. Aren't they the couple that had a going away party that several members of the Fuckholes actually attended?
Lawrence Guy's reported 4 year/$20m deal is really only 1 year with up to $5.1 guaranteed. Nothing guaranteed beyond that or beyond year one, and his cap hit is only $3.6m. If he sucks, Pats cut him for free in 2018. BB is a contract genius. 
Lawrence is good at football
Lawrence maroney. Best draft pick bill has ever made 
Lawyered. Boom. 
LAX doesn't have a gate for us so we are just sitting on the tarmac AND it's actually raining for once

Legal Sea Food, about 6 or 7 years ago, changed their batter on all their fried items to be completely gluten free. They purposely didn't tell anyone and tested the new recipe at the Newton location.

Let me rephrase my statement to shift the focus off of what you are so hyped up about. Financial aid aside, it's also hard to attract students from low SES backgrounds, who statistically are more likely to come from minority families to come to your school that charges the equivalent of a house with a two car garage and two cars to fit in said garage (in some parts of the US) in tuition.

Let me rephrase. Why is digging up someone's front lawn and replacing it with sod and flower beds an essential service?
Let me tell you a story. In the 2001 nfl postseason, a team made the playoffs and were severe underdogs against a Raiders team with Charles Woodson and Jerry Rice, against a great Pittsburgh Team, and against a team with an offense labeled “the greatest show on turf.” If a committee was picking matchups based on which team was “better,” this team would have been robbed of a chance to win the super bowl. Because the “better” teams didn’t win, we now have a dynasty and the greatest quarterback of all time. That’s why we play the game. 
Let me tell you the story of another running back who scored four touchdowns in a game.

Like I said, he gets half of October off
"Like I said, he is coming back but I don't know that it will be with the Broncos. I think this gives them increase leverage to cut him after his physical if his leg hasn't completely healed, which is entirely possible given his age and the fact that he played like 5 games on the injury

Living here, I never thought of Boston as a racist city. But this isn't the first sports related incident involving overt racism, so I'm starting to get the impression that there is a small but vocal group of racists here. A lot of espn reporters and former athletes have made comments about Boston being racist, so I guess I have to accept the idea that people from Boston aren't all as open and tolerant as I grew up thinking 
Living on the red line for 2 years, I would switch red and orange.

Looks like Joe is winning this breakup with B School Taylor 
Looks like Joe killed the GroupMe with his awful defense of Morcus. And his murder of most of the bots
Looks like Joe's 2 weeks at home aren't going to be that special after all
Looks like John is going to be dying on that hill
Looks like Jonathan Taylor did this today too. He can get cut but let's not ban him. The Path would like to under pay him to be on a different losing team 
Looks like Jordanzer is taking a bus to Boston 
Looks like JuJu made it to the SB
Looks like Kovin supports slavery and murder of migrant workers and banning of alcohol 
Looks like Kovin went all the way to Ireland just to look at a bunch of rocks for a week
Looks like Krooked Joey has no respect for federal drug law. What a surprise 
Looks like lebron is deflating his basketballs. If Silver was a real commissioner, he'd suspend lebron for the rest of the playoffs. 
Looks like Marcus will go back to not posting in the GroupMe after he hangs himself because of that lost 
Looks like Obama failed Morcus again 
Looks like Russell Wilson forgot that Jimmy Graham exists again 
Looks like she has a sniz up her snook 
Looks like someone is going to be out of a job soon!
Looks like the 62 million number was reported several days ago and just saw it on the evening news at my parents house. Fucking boomers 
Looks like the case has been remanded back to the lower courts, so they'll have a chance to argue again with Judge Berman
Looks like the cheating Broncos had to cheat to beat the Pats
Looks like the front of the capitol is getting cleared out now, which is good 
Looks like the GroupMe died too
Looks like The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) killed all of the terrorists already. What a hero 
Looks like the red line had another severe delay. That sounds like a fun way to spend Friday before a long weekend 
Looks like there is a bar in the middle of the casino where we can meet 
Looks like they are about to blow their lead 
Looks like they are making a movie about aang and the crew as adults
Looks like they play on Thanksgiving, but it's not the night game. So kind of misleading
Looks like this is the third wrong thing goody has reported in two days 
Looks like we are having another illegitimate champion this year 
Looks like we need some collusion to help me win. Who is up for sending me their best running back?!
Looks like we're rioting boiz 
Looks like we've said all we need to say about golf. Time to move on
Looks like you found one
Looks like you have to swim part of the way?
Looks like you need a quarterback, Jordan. I'll trade you Wentz for everyone good on your team and $50 draft dollars 
Looks like you need a tight end @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼. Do you want Ebron or Rudolph 
Looks like you need some adblock plus
Looks more like Bortles to me 
Looks nothing like you
Looks pretty much entirely on the Spanish side of the border
Loooots of incentives
Looting also puts more money in your pocket

Low hanging parallel thinking
Low key important discovery from re-reading the groupme messages from last night: Marcus only participates when Becker is here. He must really hate us 
Low key important result of the trade for McCourty: doesn't count against us in compensatory pick formula
Low key take away from Bocker's story is that he didn't stand up for the family who was being harassed
Low key. Studying. Planning a run later. The normal deal
LOWE

Lower barrier to entry
Lower glycemic index foods mean that they are broken down more slowly, so you get a slower, steadier rise in blood sugar. High glycemic index foods make your blood sugar spike and can cause you to crash soon after when your body mass produces insulin to compensate. 
Lower glycemic index foods reduce your risk of developing type II diabetes and reduce complications if you already have diabetes because you're not getting that quick spike in blood sugar followed by a quick spike in insulin (which can contribute to insulin resistance as you get older) 
Lower than 14%
Lower, confirmed.

Lucky for Bock, I am the critical care resident tonight so I get to decide if he gets activated as a trauma patient and gets a room immediately or if he goes to sit in the ambulance triage waiting area for 9 hours 
Lucky for Brian Flores that his players know how to play once they cross the sideline onto the field

MA currently admitted patients is now below 3000 for the first time since April 12
MA gains 22% more first year college students than it produces 
MA had a day last week with 3k new cases and another day with 5k+, and the governor held press conferences both days to remind people that the numbers were due to massive increases in testing those days and not more spread of the disease. I feel like Baker has done a good job messaging and not spreading hysteria
MA now is back to well over 600 COVID positive patients admitted to hospitals as of today. Over 100 in ICUs, over 50 intubated. Our positive test rate has jumped from 1% last month to 6.6% today 
Ma puns are also really good 
MA reported more than 1,000 new daily COVID cases for the first time since June 1st. We back in this, boiz 
MA state senate passed a policing reform bill at 4 am this morning. The proposed changes include banning chokeholds, limiting tear gas use, and mandatory racism training for all licensed officers and future trainees. The bill would also establish an independent commission that would certify the license for all officers and would have the independent power to investigate allegations of misconduct/excessive use of force, and could renew/revoke/modify licenses of all officers in the state.
MA still is seeing positive growth daily for new case rate 
MA, NH, ME, VT. Have to carry a terrible state to get three perfect ones

Marc decided to go with Dan and create their own thing. Gregg was offered to come supposedly but declined. The rumor (I don’t know if he ever confirmed this?) was that he needed health insurance for a sick family member and needed the stability of the job and couldn’t risk jumping ship
Marc definitely won the bet

Marcus actually helping out the GroupMe right now AND shitting on bocker? This doesn't feel right, but I enjoy it very much

Marcus could always rent a zip car or pay for Jordan’s uber if he was feeling generous

Marcus, I'll pick us a gluten free restaurant 
Marcus, just wanted to let you know, friend to friend, that this new diet I'm on has really cut out all my cravings. I haven't felt like eating a single thing all day!! 
Marcus, my ability to put money towards a monetary punishment for the league would be dependent on my decision to not spend the money elsewhere on an item or experience that would surely bring me more pleasure than whatever the league punishment would bring me
Marcus, today I moved moving boxes across eastern massachusetts, visited with my grandmother in rehab, and bought materials for a home project at home depot. Sorry that we all can'
Marcus, unlike you, I focus my attention on reading every word that is posted in the GroupMe. A dedicated Fuckhole like myself does not have the time to click on links and read the words there, too. If it is not written within the GroupMe, it is not worth reading.
Marcus, we're talking about porn now. Keep up

Mariota is bad 
Mariota to Ravens 
Mariota*?

Mark Z and I are going to have a long talk about this 
Market basket. So hot right now
Marketing definitely feels like an occupation where in person collaboration is important
Marky Mark makes shitty burgers and is married to a woman who single handedly has put millions of Americans at risk by increasing vaccine skepticism 
Marlins 
Marquise Goodwin tho
Married couples have the option to file jointly or separately on their federal income tax returns. The IRS strongly encourages most couples to file joint tax returns by extending several tax breaks to those who file together. In the vast majority of cases, it's best for married couples to file jointly, but there may be a few instances when it's better to submit separate returns.
Married guys in their thirties are supposed to get drunk and complain about their wives. Not play a game that Joe made his orientation groups do every year 
Marry cyclists because they will die young anyway, fuck gas powered leaf blowers, definitely kill basketball 
Marry people who say celiac's (because Bocker is the champion of that, and it's 2019, stop being judgmental), fuck the feet, kill Watt
Marshawn lynch leaning towards retirement. I am going to be pissed if the greatest steal in the history of the Fuckholes fucking retires
Marshawn told the team right before they got on the plane that he couldn't play this week, so he's ruled out. 
Martin has one week of production without Lynch.....6.9 (lol) points
Marty B was also playing with a high ankle sprain and a knee ligament sprain for 60% of the season and was functioning as the only tight end in a system that very much wanted to feature two tight ends. 
Marty Bennett is going to catch the game winner just to fuck me
Marty Bennett said after the super bowl that he was happy they won because teams overpay super bowl champs. Only positive is that he's 30, had several different injuries throughout the year, and by all accounts this is a TE-loaded draft, so maybe he doesn't get the value he's looking for
Marty Walsh because he’s a BC guy
Marty Walsh committed a lot of money to fund restoration of the north point bridge and other infrastructure to benefit GE while (in many people's eyes) not doing enough to curb the rising cost of housing in Boston 
Maryland football player dies at practice. Team basically assumes negligence. Coach gets put on leave for 8 games. Reinstated yesterday. Players walked out of practice in protest. People complained. Fired today.
Maryland is a necessary evil because it's so close to DC, which is a good place to visit
Maryland is real bad 
Mason Rudolf. 
Mason Rudolf. He's going to fall to the Pats. Book it.
Mass and Cass
Mass is going to start banning at least draft kings soon. AG is investigating legality and draft kings is Boston based, making it probably illegal if they do consider it sports betting 
Mass issues a stay at home order too
Massachusetts # of hospitalized patients decreased two days in a row
Massachusetts has a 2% uninsured rate. Your cost isn’t that affected by uninsured people 
Massachusetts now has <1000 patients admitted to the hospital
Massachusetts still has a mask mandate, so I still wear masks in stores and will wear them in restaurants for as long as they are required. I have not been wearing them outside, except there are a few older people who are still wearing masks at the dog park, so I just slip my mask back on if I go near them as a courtesy 
Massachusetts: 1.559 mil democrat, 490k republican, 4.22mil total 
Massage from a gay man because it means I wouldn't need heart surgery 
Master of Science of Nursing, Primary Care Certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner-Board Certified
Masterclass of what not to do 
Masturbating less than 7 times a day might help the pain 
Match day virtual, 95% change graduation will be virtual. It's lit.
Matches were actually at noon, but I did not call attention to that fact because I wanted him to have undisturbed time to celebrate/grieve

May I also submit this to the court for review?
May I at least have tj Yates put back on my roster in case someone outbids me?
May I please claim your oven for 25 minutes to heat up dip/jalapeño poppers?

Maybe
Maybe #GoodyTagliabue will step in and correct obvious injustice by the current commissioner. 
Maybe @emyrbot will give a more timely response
Maybe @Jamie Bourque  will be inspired to take it
Maybe @Joey Brackets 
Maybe @The Big Dick Bandit wouldn't be working 5 hours on a Sunday if he didn't spend his whole day reading some random person's Twitter feed
Maybe a 6th 
Maybe a company in 2020 should invest in infrastructure that allows employees to complete work functions from anywhere in the world instead of relying on local networks 
maybe a little fresh basic chiffonade on top too
Maybe a little, but honestly I don't get anything from their programming. I'm not usually watch tv that isn't a sport game. I rely on Twitter and online news sites for my sports news 
Maybe also a running shirt 
Maybe an attempt to stop an additional spike when people start going outside more
Maybe Anthony wiener paid off his ex wife to sabotage Hillary's campaign under the promise of a trump cabinet position 
Maybe be shouldn't have punched a wall in triple A
Maybe big enough that he has the games on in the background while he reads the new edition of Good Housekeeping
Maybe Buffalo chicken dip but only if goody comes
Maybe CarLOLina? 
Maybe companies should pay their employees more
Maybe conferences should just go away 
Maybe cover Kupp 
Maybe death will find me and put me out of my misery before I have to deal with another nba season 
Maybe don’t lose in the championship game then 
Maybe don't jump over the back of the guy you're tackling 
Maybe Drake Maye doesn’t like Joe’s friend which is very likely given the company that he keeps 
Maybe even an A+ call 
Maybe everyone at that TJs knows Leah Ziegler 
Maybe focus on tackling him and not trying to strip him 
Maybe freeney?
Maybe Geno has a completely different career if he never skips that guy's fundraiser 
Maybe get lined up a little faster so you're not snapping as soon as the kicker stops his positioning 
Maybe have some eye bleach ready
Maybe he can take Jamie's fantasy football spot when he doesn't take the SAT's
Maybe he could if you guys dropped off a letter at his office
Maybe he could learn/remember some tricks 
Maybe he didn't hear no whistle 
Maybe he does 
Maybe he does need that extra year of school
Maybe he forgot his $45 vitamins this morning
Maybe he found God. 
Maybe he had a running stopwatch on his phone and didn't have to look back.
Maybe he is right for baking 
Maybe he is. Have you checked on Angela recently?
Maybe he just didn't want to live in Philly, which is a trash city with trash sports fans and a quarterback who I always said was not the guy 
Maybe he just has Covid again 
Maybe he should have had better questions
Maybe he should have had that done a month ago when he went to four specialists before he decided not to have surgery
Maybe he should just shut up and dribble. I’ve seen enough of him on Amazon commercials lately 
Maybe he should pitch, and try to pitch well 
Maybe he should plan his trips to Boston around my schedule. Maybe he’s the bad friend. 
Maybe he should retire
Maybe he shouldn’t be a bitch 
Maybe he wanted to do that because Addazio killed his love for football
Maybe he was actually texting Shelbie and covered it up by blaming it on another groupme
Maybe he was afraid that it wouldn't be gluten free
Maybe he will come back if @Jordan Kelleher  says the n word again
Maybe he will start scoring now that the Texans' weakest link JJ Watt is gone 
Maybe he would have showed you his cock if you had given him money 
Maybe he’ll become a heroin addict 
Maybe he’s hanging out with bitches
Maybe he'd be able to avoid those two back to back sacks at the end of the half if his leg wasn't half bionic 
Maybe he'd be better if he talked to his father. 
Maybe he'll just refuse to take the oath of office. Maybe he's been fucking with us the whole time. Maybe Hilldawg is in on it 
Maybe he'll man up and take David Johnson away from Kevin. Preferably before Sunday 
Maybe he's a better help psychiatrist
Maybe he's cracking under the pressure of stardom 
Maybe he's dead 
Maybe he's just responding to all of his unread texts
Maybe his dumbass smartphone doesn’t work well enough to look up the address, since it isn’t an iPhone 
Maybe host your wedding outside of a warzone 
Maybe I am giving rich people too much credit
Maybe I am just insulated but I have not seen any criticism of the Patriots
Maybe I am making it up but I seem to remember them getting Darrow's number 
Maybe I am making it up, but I feel like that chick wanted to fuck Darrow sophomore year 
Maybe I am on crack 
Maybe I am reading too much into that.....
Maybe I can adjust to make it clearer 
Maybe I can't tell from the picture but I don't think they're as bad as the packers or steelers throwbacks 
Maybe I just have been playing too much Halo, but SoFi stadium looks like a Covenant ship 
Maybe I just haven't seen it because I haven't been looking, but I am surprised there hasn't been more talk about renaming Black Friday 
Maybe I made that up
Maybe I should delete the Fuckswoles grouome
Maybe I should listen to it then instead of just reading the reddit headline 
Maybe I should lock it up....
Maybe I would know that if darrow actually followed through and came to my apartment on Saturday 
Maybe if @Ass Ketchum was more.dedicated to your flag team, you would have won 
Maybe if @Josh Dobbs Stan  opened the GroupMe at any point between those messages, he would have been shut out of all of the great #content
Maybe if B school Paige Kozlowski gets rich enough, she'll pay for Joe to go to game 6 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. If that's the case, I am happy for Joe, but not every Paige Kozlowski can be the daughter of an oil tycoon I suppose.
Maybe if I get frostbite she’ll remember me as the Fuckhole who didn’t listen to her and got frostbite 
Maybe if I ignore my egregious typo, Joe won’t come in here and says “Joff!”
Maybe if our dictator hadn't forced us into a poorly constructed platform 
Maybe if so many people didn't have goddamn food allergies, we would be able to teach a unified view on food 
Maybe if the bullied their teammates, they would be tougher football players 
Maybe if they didn't have an organ that sheds itself and bleeds every month they'd have less expenses to worry about. Be better evolved. 
Maybe if we all ignore goody , he'll judy go away 
Maybe if we are really really quiet, he will get confused and leave again
Maybe if we could get 3 yards on two plays
Maybe if we had a $50 buy in you'd put more effort into checking your team
Maybe if you have to yell at Morcus for 20 minutes during dinner, you shouldn't go to dinner with Morcus 
Maybe if you invited us to join your team, you selfish fucknut
Maybe if you just don't say anything, @Jamie Bourque will continue to ignore you and never come to collect 
Maybe if you managed your money better and didn't get yourself in so much debt, you could afford a car. 
Maybe if you picked a weekend that I could come visit, it would get organized properly 
Maybe if you start the circle jerk with a college football post 
Maybe if you took the initiative to get to know your friends better instead of punching holes in walls, Ryan would have hooked you up with a shadowing opportunity 
Maybe I'll go be a private doctor for people going on lavish vacations or something 
Maybe I'll write my op-ed about how Bocker shouldn't be allowed to be on his parents' insurance
Maybe I'm a naive idealist, but it's very frustrating to me just how averse the Dems are to welcoming in younger voices in big elections. Every 4 years, I hope for someone who isn't 70+ who can better connect to younger voters and every year the Dems just pick a shitty establishment candidate. Bernie is the only exception but it's clear that the Dems don't want to nominate him
Maybe is Marcus thought that our groupme was worth contributing to, we would know the full story by now 
Maybe it is done a lot to bring happiness to society, but its too popular and I hate it
Maybe it was a trick to see what you'd do and because you didn't call her out, you failed 
Maybe it was, but that's all I remember 
Maybe it’s the video games /s
Maybe it's different for your industry
Maybe it's just because we're in the healthcare field but that's a pretty commonly discussed statistic. I've read it from different sources several times
Maybe it's just me, but I feel like congress has more important things to tackle than whether or not daily fantasy leagues are legal or not 
Maybe it's the Yolanda that I met 
Maybe it's this Jeff guy that everyone keeps talking about 
"Maybe it's time to break out this bad boy.* Since I have been saying I am going to do it for years. 

*stolen from Reddit "
Maybe JBoss, since he has already participated in one, but I doubt that he would want to lose cell service for 2 hours again
Maybe John can take your spot if you do 
Maybe Josh Gordon shoulda tried to knock that down
Maybe just me, but that wasn't on my radar of places I thought he would go. Is he supposed to replace Landry in the slot?
Maybe Kevin is truly an emotional person but you guys don't allow him a safe space to express himself 
Maybe Lebron will move the team out of OKC to a city that doesn't have a real professional team, like NYC
Maybe less and it just seems like it was that long ago
Maybe mcl 
Maybe Morcus shouldn't be responsible for caring for his child at this moment on time 
Maybe my personal preference, but I much preferred Trulia.com over either Zillow or Redfin. Layout and search features just worked better for me
Maybe not better when tebow was in the league, eating a regulated diet, studying film all day, and working out with world class strength coaches. Now he has a designer to pick his suits out on the abc network 
Maybe not more than jerbear 
Maybe not on the same level as the astros
Maybe now he'll be in the right environment to bloom 
Maybe NSFW for Chan?
Maybe one week, I will learn to start Godwin 
Maybe photoshop him into an uber too
Maybe practicing situational football, as if this were a preseason game 
Maybe Roberts should have had someone warming up
Maybe she is actually a man. We'll never know. 
Maybe she was volunteering at a soup kitchen during the game and couldn't watch it 
Maybe she will settle out of court 
Maybe she would have traded that for an LG TV that just works 
Maybe she'll actually put some damn traffic signs on campus 
Maybe she's finally moved on 
Maybe slightly. Hollywood California is one of the worst places in the world 
Maybe so, but he still has to wake up every morning knowing that he's Chris Chan 
Maybe stop prognosticating about what may happen in this game 
Maybe take the 4 minutes to send us an invite next time
Maybe that means Joe is just delusional to not lose hope after 7 seasons?
Maybe that says more about the quality of the comments than my level of engagement in the conversation
Maybe that's what we need to make America great again 
Maybe that's where my resentment came from 
Maybe the Bourques are just white supremacists and only associate with white males 
Maybe the boyfriend got kicked out of his new place and the girlfriend had to find a new place to move into? 
Maybe the dinner was so bad because you weren't there with us
Maybe the GroupMe would be more lit at night if you decided to grace us with your presence 
Maybe the jets should hire Theo 
Maybe the media went easy on him because there isn't anything negative on which to report. Trump is pretty much Gandhi, Mandela, and Darrowball rolled into one saint of a human being 
Maybe the nerrrrs should have signed brady 
Maybe the nfl asked Brian Williams what happened in the locker room. I heard he was there before the game 
Maybe the OS is being scrapped until Mama Bocks has the capital from her tacos tapas restaurant to invest 
Maybe the person who removed him could be man enough to apologize when he gets kicked a second time
Maybe the R word was called for
Maybe the representative sample is biased because Nielsen boxes favor homes (?) which skews towards older Americans who are less likely to report being sports fans? 
Maybe the running back who is averaging 6.8 YPC warrants the ball more often
Maybe their economy is garbage because they don't spend a fuck ton on unnecessary healthcare
Maybe there is a theme, since IMBD rated Fishes 9.6
Maybe they are ranking them higher for the same reason 
Maybe they are so committed to slinging khakis that they can't accept being less than 100% 
Maybe they can convince her to do a sexy acting scene for you 
Maybe they fired him for using the wrong form of there
Maybe they just thought that you'd have a better immune system
Maybe they should be better actors if they want awards 
Maybe they should be concerned about their 3rd down defense and not a coin toss
Maybe they should hire an employee who actually shows up to work. Lazy bitch
Maybe they should storm city hall with assault rifles. That seems to work out for the white guys
Maybe they will dock our first and third on the night before the draft
Maybe they would get more people to volunteer at vaccine clinics if they paid medical students instead of asking for free labor.
Maybe they'll finally get some love in the playoff rankings. 
Maybe they'll save it for the politics groupme?
Maybe they're into Dutch ovens
Maybe this beautiful, smiling man will cheer you up 
Maybe this is an LG situation. Purposely gets cut. Comes back to the Pats. Wins a championship 
Maybe this is based on conversations with you guys and Chloe but I was always under the impression that he was known as an asshole and a creep 
Maybe this is just too hard of a TEST for you
Maybe this is personal bias, but I feel as though Stowe is far more built up, is a bigger mountain, has better snowmaking, and is in a better location in Vermont. Not sure how Jay could justify getting three times more
Maybe this will end any "bengals are a Super Bowl team" conversation early this year 
Maybe three times as hard 
Maybe try covering and tackling Tyreek 
Maybe try covering Kelce 
Maybe try going to a real baseball park 
Maybe try tackling Tyreek 
Maybe try using some context clues
Maybe we are just sad that one of our greatest friends doesn't put in the effort to converse with us via groupme anymore 
Maybe we can #SquadUp too
Maybe we can beat some d3 teams 
Maybe we can gamble on his life after he gets covid
Maybe we can hire an offensive genius like Hackett
Maybe we can poach an up and coming assistant coach like the Texas A&M offensive line coach
Maybe we can talk about how PPR is superior to non-PPR @DJ Chanukah 
Maybe we can write them down with the next iteration of fantasy league rules 
Maybe we should abolish conferences all together 
Maybe we should block 
Maybe we should call the corona hotlight to ask 
Maybe we should have more education for loan recipients then. 
Maybe we should have the team with two owners split up....
Maybe we should murder both twins instead of just @John Thompson d/b/a Alpha Twin, LLC 
Maybe we shouldn't have switched to a fantasy football system with glitchy scoring
Maybe we will be invited to your next wedding
Maybe we would have known that if we had a 🐐 list 
Maybe we wouldn't have this issue if the old commissioner wasn't a bitch
Maybe when you have bought athletic tickets? 
Maybe when you spell my name right you asshat 
Maybe why that's why he's not around 
Maybe will do sloppy Joe's too
Maybe work on your phrasing 
Maybe you can code new bots 
Maybe you can see half a mile down route one
Maybe you can send me the link when I have an income 
Maybe you can throw some stick-um on jerry rice and bring him back 
Maybe you could ask for clarification instead of accusing me of the only thing almost as bad as skimming 
Maybe you should be a cartographer, John
Maybe you should be concerned with the person we think you've become 
Maybe you should buy a custom Broncos Rodgers jersey...
Maybe you should consider having a normal functioning bowel then 
Maybe you should cover Gabriel Davis
Maybe you should create a tribunal of "serious" fantasy football players with a direct line to the commissioner, then keep that GroupMe a secret from other members who would eventually feel left out and slighted after learning of its existence
Maybe you should discuss the rate of attrition from your precious league. You've lost perennial power houses like Goody, Joff, and James while only retaining the likes of Morcus \
Maybe you should go back to school for your PhD in Middle Eastern Studies
Maybe you should go to areas without internet access. You know, to get the full experience of rural America.
Maybe you should have just moved to Somerville like you said you we're going to 
Maybe you should learn about the BUSINESS of vaccines. The government gives companies contracts to make X amount of drug. These companies make the same regardless of how many people get vaccinated.
Maybe you should post it to the girls' groupme and let them comment on it
Maybe you should start ordering from the chipotle app and not GrubHub. Maybe you're getting up charged or having lots of fees added
Maybe you should tag him 
Maybe you should teach Gregg some things about picking games 
Maybe you should vote for a candidate who does not believe in vaccines.
Maybe you shouldn’t draft guys who were going to get injured 
Maybe you shouldn't cut out my workbag on the floor next to my desk 
Maybe you'd hate work less if you allocated more than 6.25% of your total expenses to something other than student loans 
Maybe you'd have a better shot of making up that 30 point difference if you started a kicker 
Maybe you'd know that from the libtard podcasts if you had the right headphones @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
Maybe your company, which controls internet screening, is too high tech to figure out how to manage the antiquated MBTA systems. 
Maybe your fees would decrease with the amount of money they've fined our upstairs neighbors
Maybe your mom can use her cash to hire a patent lawyer to get some IP protection on the OS 
Maybe your taste buds were just really really bad last night 
Maybe you're a libtard
Maybe you're right, but I've traveled to a few smaller cities for med school interviews and ubers barely exist there. It's all taxis in the very limited environments I've seen. Purely anecdotal 
Maybe*
Maybe, but you can get a CB1 as an UDFA every 3 years 
Maybe, or maybe Blake Bortles is really good 
Maye could have been murdered on that play. Fucking Lowe. 
Maye has a higher ceiling no doubt but I don't need an injury 4 snaps into the season
Maye has definitely settled in. Also, AVP finally letting Drake get the ball out quickly 
Maye has thrown a pick and has 1? completion but still is our best offensive player 
Maye is not an FLB 
Maye with a terrible play on that strip sack. Can't have that ball out like that 
Maye, Gonzo, White, Schooler, Hunter
Maye....
Mayeb
Mayfield is small, which is a big knock on him from scouts. Darnold makes a lot of mistakes.
Maynmar 
Mayo 
Mayo and Collins both hurt. 
Mayo could absolutely get hired this season as a defensive quality control coach 
Mayo is a pussy bitch tho 
Mayo is also not qualified to do what Mayo is doing 
Mayo is bad at in game management, bad at the media, bad at keeping the team disciplined
Mayo needs to challenge that 
Mayo needs to Mayo up this defense 
Mayo was not the right pick. Mayo made a ton of bad decisions which made his job and the job of those around him much harder. But he was a fantastic player and probably a good person and I could see him eventually being deserving of another chance with another team sometime years down the line 
Mayo would definitely try to pull a Lovie Smith if he's concerned he's about to be fired 
Mayo would never

McCabe fired 
McCain put out a statement basically saying that there is an assessment of cost burden due to transgender service members ongoing right now. It doesn't sound like anything has been documented to show what the actual cost is compared to "regular" servicemen and women. But my concern is that you're basically saying that someone who is willing to fight and die for their country is not adequate enough to do so. Women cost more because they go on to have children after serving. Are you going to bar them from joining the military now? In my mind, you should accept anyone fit and willing to serve the country. To do otherwise disillusions individuals and is bad for our military and our nation
McCarthy to the Boys 
McCarthy was speaker of the house. He is no longer that 
McConnell also walked out of the chamber after the vote and basically said it's Trump's fault but the constitution doesn't allow me to convict a former president, which has been debated by constitutional law scholars over the past several weeks 
Mccourtey and Chung are sneakily one of the best safety pairs in the league 
McCourty gunna have to play up closer to the line, Harmon gunna have to play back 
McCourty took the worst possible angle 
McCown broke his left hand 
McCoy + AJ green for Diggs and McFadden
McCoy has a lot of potential and has consistently played better as the season has progressed. He'd be worth something to someone 
McDaniel*

McKinnon on the trade block, hit me up with offers. I know you're all interested
McVay is the Patrick Mahomes of coaching. Dynasty of 1, dick sucked raw by Big Media 
McVay should have taken the media job this past off-season 
McVay's season last year was essentially an older Stafford, a hobbled Kupp, and a bunch of rookies and look what he did. I think the team has fallen short of some expectations this year but the man can coach

Like the Somerville of 20 years ago, Revere suffers a perception problem. But with a revamped downtown and ongoing development along its roughly 3.5-mile-long beach, bidding wars are not unusual. People priced out of areas like East Boston are realizing Revere is “very nice and not so far away,” says Silvia Sandoval Guerini, broker/owner of Stonehurst Real Estate Group. Three subway stops, 4 miles to Boston, a straight shot to the North Shore, and being close to Logan Airport are nice, but young families are drawn by Revere’s increasing abundance of kids programs, five new schools in the past 12 years, and educational initiatives that are getting national attention."

Melrose had Matt stone. His dad was a gang cop in Boston and so he decided he would start a "gang" in Melrose. They literally just went around to parties and tried to pick fights. The last fight I heard of that got him arrested was he crashed a party on one of the local golf courses, tried to pick a fight with a kid who asked him to leave, and then used a wooden baseball bat to beat the shit out of another kid who was trying to break up the fight 
Melrose High School 
Melrose high school was very diverse. We bussed our minorities in from Boston
Melrose is filled with upper middle class kids who try their damnedest to be trashy. We had a huge heroin problem in the early 2000s (still do, but not so much with the students anymore). When I went through high school, three or four girls got pregnant in the grades below me. Big drug and alcohol problems among students. Plus we're close to revere, which is the root of all of our problems 
Melrose just had a high schooler jump in front of a commuter rail train on Monday. At least he had the balls to go out instead of you MC kids 
Melrose was in an uproar over $40k that was allocated to buying new firearms for the police department. The money was in the city budget at the beginning of the fiscal year but the purchase was supposed to happen in June. 
Melrose was too ghetto; we had to play our sports in the street dodging cars and crackheads 
Melrose: at least we are better than Wakefield
Melrose-Wakefield is up 4 patients though. Better watch out for that

MGH does free raffles for employees for Pats tickets almost every preseason and some home games. I happened to win for next week 
MGH has the opposite problem. There is some company that finds random contacts for people in the building and will mail them toner then send them a bill that's jacked up 300%+. They'll then call and send invoices until stupid people pay for them
MGH is buddy buddy with the Pats and raffle off tickets every week. I won this week. They have some "VIP" tailgate that just fees like a bunch of wealthy people and their lowly employees who happened to win tickets for the respective companies 
MGH is down about 20 or so

Mixed feelings. He could certainly help the d line and his size will be a good addition to our interior run d (if they use him for that). He's another body in the rotation and is a worthy fit to replace Hicks. My concern is taking snaps away from the younger guys, and the fact that he missed a game last year (at New England) for cluster headaches that he gets chronically. I'm hoping that a) that doesn't play a factor, and b) that the pats continue with their really good rotation and continue to give plenty of snaps to brown, Easley, and a bunch of the other young guys that didn't get to play last year

Video from the Indianapolis Marriott Downtown shows Sanchez approaching the driver's door of a large box truck in the alley, according to a probable cause affidavit. He opened the door and began a conversation with a man, who was struggling to understand because he wasn't wearing his hearing aids, he told police.

Video shows the two appear to have an interaction back at the driver's side door after Sanchez follows the man, who is seen walking backwards away from him.

""Sanchez is seen running after (the man) and the video shows Mr. Sanchez grabbing and throwing (the man) towards the wall of the Westin,"" police wrote in the affidavit.

The fight continues in the alley between a large dumpster and the truck before moving toward the middle of the alley.

most widely cited* - typo
Mostly because he can't throw that far
Mostly because I didn't know who that was for a while 
Mostly because I started their D in fantasy one week and wasn't rewarded as much as I had expected 
Mostly because Nock and I don't know him, and as Bocker said, we don't want to be hypocrites
Mostly because of being smashed and all that
Mostly just places to go walk around on the north shore: crane estate, eastern point lighthouse, bradley palmer state park, the shoreline in gloucester. Yesterday was in the 40s so I stupidly assumed today would be as well 
Mostly Marquise Flowers (LB) 
Mostly so Marcus stops talking about him
Mostly that, but John and Nick responded civilly, thanking Erin for her in depth analysis on the situation 
Motherfucker. 
Motherfuckers 
Motherfucking shit

Motion to call Jordan a skimmer for not knowing about this request despite it being brought up no fewer than 30 times in the GroupMe. 
Motion to donate 50% of the buy in to planned parenthood to piss off goody 
Motion to make drew brees garbage time touchdowns worth 2 points 
Motion to remove Darrow from the finals and replace him with Bocker. 
Moulton might still win
Mount willard was a solid rec, @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson

Move The Sticks has mocked Chris Lindstrom to the Pats too - BC has really been trying to push that narrative
Moved back 14 spots from the 6th round to the 7th to get Jason McCourty. Essentially free
Moves to NY and suddenly he starts rooting for a rival team. I bet his dad doesn't even work for MSG.

Movie is terrible. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
Movies straight suck now. The only quality movie I've seen in years is Eurovision. Instant classic
Moxie is black licorice flavored soda that you only drink if you over 90 and you have slowly watched all your friends die
MPD got anti-racist training instead 
Mr. "all I do is GroupMe and sell khakis at a dangerously low price" got beat at his own game and now wants to complain
Mr. "I work more than anyone here!!!" somehow has time to go to the bakery and hang out with JJ
Mr. "What does everyone think of no country for old men"
Mr. Bock?!? Big yikes
Mr. Commissioner, that is wrong and unjust. The definition of collusion is a secret conspiracy. There was no conspiracy and no secret, as Ryan announced that he had dropped tannehill in a public manner. 
Mr. Goodwin called @Daz 4 Prez Jamie.  
Mr. October
Mr. Perfectly Fine is v banging af
Mr. Steal Yo Gurl Bofa? Like Bank of America? I always said that BofA will ruin your connection to the avatar state 
Mrs. Bocker at least knows who I am, unlike Mrs. Goody. Can’t wait to chill with her 
Mrs. Campbell told the principal that I was racist and the principal told my parents that another student's mom thought I was racist so I lost privileges to use my brand new razor scooter for a week. Shit was weak 
Mrs. Scialdoni's chemistry class?
MRW I feel like I know where this conversation is going.

MRW Jordan doesn't disagree with my sports take 
MSU lost, Ravens player died, and Ricardo Lockette lost his matchup. Very bad day for sports 
Mt sinai did not invite me for an interview. Actually, no NYC program did 
Much better idea. That's why you're the real commissioner. 
Much less 
Much less lit than a Ukrainian nuclear plant 
Much like the individual games, the playoffs drag out the end for far longer than is needed

My 7th grade math teacher used to give out tootsie rolls if you got a question right. He would often throw them to girls and say "here have this to suck on"
My 96 year old grandma to Olivia: "Do you have many blacks in the hospital where you work? Some of them here are good but others are just very bad." 
My accusation is that you said you didn't want Cam because it would require changing the whole offensive personnel. We got Cam. We did not change the personnel. Therefore you were wrong. Just take your L.

My argument is simply that last nights game shouldn't sway people onto the "Peyton is goat" side of the fence if they weren't already there. Obviously people have already used it to say he's the goat, but I don't think he's any more goaty after that game than he was goaty before

My gosh, he has to get rid of that 
My gosh, why do.you throw that 
My grandma always said that pasta without red sauce is a waste of pasta. Glad that Joe is wasting food and is responsible for children starving around the world
My grandmother calls the people who take care of her "the blacks." Racism checks out
My grandmother had a full case of Moxie in her basement when she died and now it is in my parents' basement and I am pretty sure it will be there until they die
My GroupMe has become sentient
My groupme is sucking more balls than Gooody on his last Ptown vacation 
My guess is since they're only one game back of the playoffs, even if he appeals (which he will), it will be expedited so his status is known before this week's game 
My guess is that she had a mass that needed to be removed and the pathology of the mass came back confirming cancer

My highest scorer was anyone who could score more than five points 
My histology professor uses comic sans in his PowerPoints. 
My history teacher sophomore eat in high school LOVED Andrew Jackson. Her family (generations earlier) used to own a slave plantation in the Carolinas, so she had a person connection (not really) to him. We spent the whole year, almost, learning about him, and about her plantation. I'm pretty sure that she was pro-slavery still 
My home test was negative so either it was a false negative or I just had some other virus. 
My hope is that these companies will also continue to do things that promote racial justice and not just stop at changing their name and brand images.
My hope is that they use the money they make from his publicity to reinvest in organizations that support the things Welles stood for 
My hope was to be 100% saved for retirement by the time I graduated medical school so all my of my future earnings could go towards me living my best life
My hope with Trump going forward is that just enough republicans abandoned support of him after the Capitol insurrection that the GOP is essentially split into two warring factions and the Dems easily and more definitely control both chambers in 2022. With Liz Cheney being censured and republicans coming after the 7 who voted to convict, this is looking pretty promising  
My hospital actually overpaid us for the last week of intern year. We are supposed to get one week of unpaid vacation, which is the week we went to Banff. The hospital accidentally paid us out for a week of vacation and aggressively deducted the money from our subsequent paychecks 
My hospital forgot to pay all of the residents for their moonlighting last month so instead of doing direct deposit during the next payroll cycle, they made us all come in today to pick up physical checks. Each envelope is sealed with a sticker that says not to cash the check before 3 pm
My hospital is trash. I'll be the first to admit it
My hospital just got a bomb threat. Sick 
My hospital just lifted the mask mandate for staff, patients, and visitors effective on Thursday 👀
My hospital just went on disaster protocol because we don't have a single open ICU or floor bed
My hospital pretends to be a real hospital. The amount of dysfunction is astronomical 
My hospital ran out of money, didn't it?
My hospital uses fahrenheit like true Americans  
My hospital's hold music getting featured in a big spot 
My hospital's medical record system went down for 4 hours (and counting) today. It was a good lesson on just how little can be done if people can't use the EMR
My hot take is that Italian food is the worst cuisine to get at a restaurant because it's the most easily replicable at home
My hot take: I am bored of the Andy Reid offense. It is the same every week. Speedy wide receives, a tight end who is bigger than everyone else and gets open down the season, and a running game that's successful because of the OL. BB/JMcD's offenses are constantly changing, showing something new every game. One week, TB12 beats you by throwing for 500 yards and 6 touchdowns. The next week, Jonas Gray has 4 rushing touchdowns. Give me that adaptability, give me something new.
My hotel has a steakhouse. All expenses billed to MGH
My ideal uni combo: Home=red and white posted above; Alternate=all blue; Away=Not quiet sure because I do not like the new away jerseys, they look weird
My inability to draft, manage my starting line up, or make smart waiver wire decisions 
My initial comment that the cop wasn't going to get in trouble was based on the video from the Wendy's shows that Brooks turned around with the taser in his hand and it looks like it is point at the cop. The counterargument that I have seen made is that by the time the officer drew his firearm, Brooks was turned around and running away, so at that point shooting him was not warranted. Also, I don't know the answer to this but if the taser was already fired (one of the officers did fire a taser), is the taser in Brooks's hand still functional and if not, does that matter?
My initial reaction is that Goody is an idiot and Kyrie is going to make a huge splash in Boston. I see us setting the wins record next year. 
My innocence was stolen ages ago 
My inside source at the garden confirmed his presence for both nights, as well as the entire Celtics team on October 20th

My mom has the same political stances as @Boe Jourque. Hard left polling is right 
My mom is literally the worst. She spends her whole life on her iPad. She HAS to post every single picture of Emilia we send her so her 60 other Facebook friends can see how cute she is, even though they aren’t actually pictures she took

My name is on the same thing 
My nap during the movie was pretty fulfilling. I don't remember a single scene 
My narrative is that Marcus didn't know what cum was until just over 9 months ago. As the resident cum boi, I believe I am the leading authority on that 
My narrative is that the only people who think Martin is good are trying to talk him up to get a better player and $15 for next year's draft
My narrative is that we will get THE guy no matter what 
My neighbor is a cunt
My neighbor rang my doorbell to tell me someone had dropped off flowers outside. The ding of the doorbell gave me PTSD

My new narrative is that Emyr hates transgender people

My offer was Joe's offer that he offered you days ago
My office bitch, return the door to how you found it 
My official answer is that I care for all parts of my patient population equally 
My official GroupMe answer is that Zappe is the second coming of Jesus and will start every game for the next 24 years 
My official stance is that Tom Brady is an idiot. You had the chance to cement your legacy as a Patriot for life. Sure you didn't win a super bowl to close out your career, but now you are going to go to another city, with a coach and offense you aren't familiar with, to try and win instead of staying where you are loved and cherished (at least by the fans and ownership) in a system you know 
My official statement is that I care about Chan and appreciate his kindness and hospitality 
My official statement is that I root for the pats to win in regulation 
My official statement is that I'll always be sad if my friend Emyr's team gets knocked out of the playoffs 
My official statement is that I'm a dedicated employee 
My official statement is that I'm exploring all options available to me at this point. My unofficial statement is fuck that guy. 
My official statement is that I'm happy for the patriots. No more questions. 
My official statement is that they are my good friends and should not be compelled to invite me to everything they do 
My official statement: Marcus is a great competitor and I am happy to lose to him in a week where my best players have byes and my entire RB core is injured.
My one post? 
My only meal this morning was a gluten free chocolate cake donut form Kane's so I'm off to a good start 
My only problem in fantasy is never being as good as my good friend Bocker 
My only question, is once we sign Brady to a 20 year commercial deal, how do we get Gisele involved?
My only two 10k eggs have both yielded scythers. Do we know if anyone in North America has gotten one of the country-restricted Pokemon in an egg?
My opinion is that I know he was on golden state but don't know if he is still on golden state 
My opinion is that that was PI
My opinion is that you should only buy gifts for people who you care about. If you aren't good friends with your coworkers, you should be under no pressure to buy them a gift. Obviously, it's hard to buy gifts for just one or two people if you work with several others on your team, so I would lean towards just not getting anyone anything
My opinion, not that it matters: I understand why people think the protests are disrespectful. But the ideal America is based on is that everyone has an equal chance. Obviously these players feel like they’re representing a minority population who they think is being disrespected and oppressed in American society. Even if you don’t agree with that, I think it’s the duty of every American to at least be interested in having a conversation about how we can make this a better country for everyone 
My order also got cancelled 
My original eye test this morning was that I looked thinner and then I put on a shirt that was clearly tighter than it was before so that wasn't a positive either
My other pet peeve is when pitchers don't just throw strikes
MY PANCAKES TASTE JUST FINE THANK YOU 
My parents bought into the whole "choose your channels" thing from Verizon. Except you don't get to pick channels, you get to pick channel packages and they break up the channels you would want to watch into separate packages so you have to buy channels you don't want to watch. My dad says it wouldn't save them any money but I couldn't make him understand why it wasn't worth it to do that 
My parents didn't call anyway; they said it wasn't worth waiting on the phone if there were no available spots listed online
My parents first cell phones like 12 years ago were on t mobile 
My parents had them for a while when I was very young 
My parents just willingly switched at our house. Absurd decision 
My parents' neighbors went down to Florida around Thanksgiving. One got sick with COVID while they were down there. The first thing they did when they got back was immediately go out to lunch (not quarantine or get tested), and they invited my parents (who smartly declined) 
My parents still own a life insurance policy on me. Wondering when my murder is going to happen
My parents went there all the time before COVID
My parents went there all the time pre COVID for their salad bar
My patients are either dead dead or they go to the ICU, so no 
My patients were all needy and didn't let me watch any of the game but all I know is that the fix must have been in so fucking hard 
My pee scale is at a 2. I am barely phased 
My pee scale was a 2, I was not stressing
My people are going to miss him in PVD. Our current mayor isn't half of the mayor Buddy was 
My pet peeve is baseball is when batters swing/don't swing at pitches that they shouldn't have/should have swung at
My phone is at the Apple Store for three hours. I get it back and only missed two Groupme messages. Y'all suck 
My phone just spoiled the next play 
My physique is flawless
My pick is the Patriots. 
My pilot just quoted anchorman during our descent to San Diego. I feel disappointed that no one else around me got it 
My place is not available but I can give you staph 
My plan is to watch the game in a mutually agreed upon location if the weather permits. If the weather does not cooperate, I will stay in and watch by myself
My players stopped scoring points and I lost another player to injury so looks like you'll all have to deal with Marcus winning because you wouldn't all give me better players
My point was that I'm taking this breaking news to the media circuit so I can make bank 
My poor FIL has been literally doing everything for his mother who was on hospice and died over the weekend, had his father go into the ICU two days before his mother died after going to the ED three times, has been trying to care for my MIL who is still undergoing breast cancer treatment, and he gets defrauded out of thousands of dollars for a house painter. Been a rough few months
My post-college bar trivia name with friends from Melrose was Too Husky for Sandusky. 
My power rankings picture is like 1/9th the size of everyone else’s 
My previous decision on the issue was misguided and naive
My previous post is directed at @Anthony Goodwin, not @The Duke 
My problem is with the warrant, which seems to have been inappropriately issued based on false information, and with the police for a) lying if they did, b) wearing plain clothes and not announcing that they were the cops, if true, c) putting on the incident report that Breonna Taylor's injuries were "none," which is a dick move. I recognize that the legal basis for trying them for murder is likely not there. But I think police should be held to the same standard. If I broke into someone's house and shot them while they were sleeping it bed, I think I would immediately be arrested, even if someone was shooting at me first. In my mind, they took an innocent life through no fault but their own and should pay the consequences through the legal system.
My psych attending told me on the first day working with him that he religiously watches Big Bang Theory and I wanted to walk out and not come back
My puppy has now destroyed the second blueberry bush in my backyard. This is definitely a conspiracy created by BIG blueberry to reduce my homegrown supply and force me to buy from the grocery store 
My QB1 got hurt, my WRs did nothing (except for the one on my bench), and the ravens offense still sucks. And I’m still going to come from behind and skull I know Joseph this week 
My quarterback played less than a half and scored 1.4 points. You should be blowing me out. 
My question is would you rather have McDaniels for his third stint as an OC instead of BJ?
My question was trying to figure out the answer to Becker's question 
My rank list has been certified.
My rate is actually 0.25% higher than what they would have offered had I not been using a physician loan. But essentially it allows physicians to put down <20% without mortgage insurance
My RB1 is hurt for an unknown length of time and my RB2 tore his acl. One of my QBs almost broke his foot last game. And I am still managing my team.

My social media game has so much real estate in Bocker's head. It's unbelievable 
My solution: kill Ryan Darrow. Don't know how that helps, but I feel like it would. 
My source in gillette is telling me Rashaad Evans at #23 if hes still available
My sources also confirm that his security had infrared binoculars to scan the crowd for anyone using their phone and immediately removed anyone they discovered 
My sources are pretty high up. @Jamie Bourque and I consult the same insiders 
My sources are telling me that both Mookie and David Price will be heading to the Dodgers by tomorrow.
My sources told ATN, who told me that Rex Burkhead was the offending Patriot who murdered Tom Brady 
My specialty was inbounding the ball, which I am pretty sure point guards don't normally do
My speech will be directed towards Kristen and Ricky, so no risk of that happening again
My spoons are here, therefore I am here 
My statement is correct because I never said he punched a ref 
My statement not entirely true but I think we can agree that they are expensive considering the limited career choices upon graduation, if you make it that far
My stats are clean 
My stats came back
My strategy is normally to go to somewhere on the map where no one else goes because I suck and I don't want to die. Either I go 99% of the game without seeing anyone else and so when I die, I want to play more; or I die right away and I want to play more. I never do anything cool
My stream is delayed, but I love that throw to Harry on 3rd down. Good work moving around the DE
My stream is loading slower than Marcus's 40 time 
My stream is probably behind the live game but I am feeling a play action bootleg to Izzo. Who says no?
My stream isn’t there yet!
My success in life is not being @BC FB is going 11-1 
My survivor pick is the Patriots. 
My take on the Karen Read documentary. She sucks and definitely could be guilty but I don't think the state effectively proved guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt 
My team blows 
My team is looking real rough this week 
My team is not good enough to be graced by the 🐐
My team stayed pretty healthy and look where that got me. 6th place. 
My third year schedule came out today. It's lit.
My thought is that I'm great
My thought process is that you're dumb 
My thought with the water is that it’s only a days worth, so it’s gone quickly and you could hope to find some on the island 
My thoughts are with her during this trying time
My thoughts: 1) Whole Foods is definitely significantly more expensive than just about any grocery store around. As Goody mentioned, however, the quality often far surpasses other stores. Some of their Prime member deals are also really good prices, which makes it a bit easier to shop. 2) I don't have any real opinion on the presence or absence of directional signs in grocery stores. I understand completely why they were put there and what the purpose is, but they are never enforced. It makes it less efficient when I am the only one abiding by the signs but everyone else is just walking in whatever direction they want. I definitely agree with Goody that it is either blatant disrespect of store policy (regardless of the efficacy of that policy) or complete ignorance of world around you. 3) Roots Cafe is the best all-gluten free cafe in ME. Don't @ me.
My thoughts: its dumb

My trade to @Chris Chan was vetoed. 
My trade was certainly not a joke. 
My understanding is that institutions cannot mandate the vaccine while it is under EUA status
My understanding is that she would have been sent to work on the side of the unit without COVID patients and another PCT who already had an n95 would have taken her spot
My understanding is that the bigger the weight, the higher the maximum CP. I could be totally wrong on that though. @The Fucking Man 
My understanding, which may be incorrect, is that you don't necessarily get nominated the year something happens. You get recognized for your work after being consistently great for several years. Some of the chefs nominated for best chef NE have had their restaurants open for a decade but are finally getting nominated now 
My underwear is filthy, and I'm not even wearing any
My unit is 50% old men who fell and broke their ribs and 50% unrestrained drivers who were ejected from their vehicles. V boring 
My unofficial answer is that Mac has the job when he comes back. Zappe has done really good things filling in but Mac has more potential to crank up the offense. 
My unofficial statement is that I'd be sad if the Celtics lost because others in the groupme would be sad 
My vanguard account lost more money 
My vent of the day: ordered food online, put in my address for delivery, order went through. Restaurant waited 30 minutes to call me to tell me that my address was too far to deliver to

My wife invited me to fake golf today. Fuck you guys 
My wife told me not to worry about Joe Bourque 
My wood was not plywood
My word is as breakable as my paper hands 
My WR and QB were in no place emotionally to continue playing that game last night after watching their friend get seriously injured on a hit 
My WR1 has three injuries. My WR2 lacerated his kidney. My flex is now my WR1 and my WR2 is Brandon lafell
My WR2 had a de facto bye 
My YTD return is 15.1%. Is that good 
My YTD return on my Vanguard is a whopping -5.70%.

Neil the Navy Seal got in a fight with Bojack because he left a pack of muffins in the produce section and Bojack saw them, decided he wanted muffins, and took them since there was no one around to lay claim. Neil then returned and stated that he claimed dibs. When Bojack did not back down, Neil took to the TV to use his status as a military veteran to prove why Bojack should have never taken the muffins. He could have used his platform to bring awareness to a real cause, like suicide among veterans, but no, Neil wanted to talk about muffins

Never met the kid and managed to avoid listening to any of his music or videos. I read that one Facebook rant and that's it. I only bring him up in an effort to steal those groupme hearts

Never responded, but the herald beat reporter Jeff Howe responded to like two dozen. Don't know how he had that patience. 
Never said anything about stealing. You're assuming he's stealing because of the color of his skin.
Never said I was 
Never said it was a conversation, just said I was talking about it. Can't prove me wrong
Never seen anyone pray for a miscarriage before. That's a miscarriage of morality is you ask me
Never seen Inside Out or Brave 
Never send free feet pics my dude. Make @Banner 18 Bourquey  pay for those
Never shopped there. Heard good things, like the idea. There is a shitty meat market in town that sells crappy stuff and is limited in the fruits and vegetables department so I'm hoping to have a place that I can walk to quickly to get food to cook 
Never show your hand, Darrow. 
Never stop
Never take your foot off the gas 
Never taken uber pool. I've taken one uber in the last four months or so

Never thought of that goody. Good point

Never worked in surgery, cannot confirm. But @Anthony Goodwin and @Imaqtpie and I think @Two Time / @Two-Time have surgeons in their family

New rule for Goody when he’s sports czar. Athletes shouldn’t be able to gain citizenship in another country to compete in the Olympics because they aren’t good enough to compete in their home country 
New rule suggestion. All possible collusion cases get put forth before an unbiased arbitrator. The only suitable candidate is of course Don Don. All text, phone, and email records must be submitted within 12 hours of the opening of the case. All Fuckholes will have a chance to argue before the arbitrator. If collusion is proved, it results in an immediate 1 week full-team benching for both managers, $50 waiver wire fine, and $25 auction fine for next year.

NFL Immaculate grid is rigged today 
NFL Immaculate grid telling me giving me two Mike Whites and neither of them is the right one
Nfl is required to consult with the nflpa for suspensions above a certain number of games. This includes Brady's 4 game suspension. They never consulted with the nflpa. This appeal may be easier than we thought 
NFL is the most corrupt. No question. Down with Goodell!
NFL mandatory minicamps have started. Why are we still watching the NBA finals? 
NFL media is a completely separate financial entity from the NFL. NFL media basically loses money 
NFL media rules are weird. The Nerrs/Ravens doesn't get flexed out of 1 pm but the Bills/Steelers get flexed to SNF
NFL taking Gronk out of the game. Fucking cheaters

Nick comes in the GroupMe to trash Trump just as fast as Morcus comes in to defend anything Republican and BC football 
Nick comes in, and in one post, elegantly makes the argument that I was trying to make for 30 minutes

Nick has gained my support with the caveat that those behaviors are affected by WAY more than self control. I'd just like to push back on that a bit.
Nick I respect that you have a different taste in music 
Nick insulted you. I just agreed
Nick is another possible choice 
Nick is coming from DC, skimmer.
Nick is easily the most likely to get arrested dye to his record of ignoring legally mandated curfew orders. 
Nick knows this GroupMe well 
Nick likes Yellowstone because the geysers remind him of the Japanese midget squirt porn he watches every night to fall asleep
Nick passed Jamie?
Nick rn
Nick Saban has no chill 
Nick Saban is trending that way but jury still out
Nick said that medical education should be free and that in turn, doctors should get paid less
Nick Shook
Nick so shook right now 
Nick was arguing that college was prohibitively expensive and pushed people down the pathway of lucrative careers, like medicine, business, and law. Nick believed that it is important for society to have people who majored in English, liberal arts, etc. and that college tuition basically prevents that from happening.

Nick, a lot of people choose to do drugs at raves. They aren't a good place for straight edge men like yourself. 
Nick, how do you feel about those lame ass electric skateboards that lazy millennials use these days 
Nick, I am not interested in attending so I wish to respectfully decline. I hope that this does not tarnish our friendship. 
Nick, Jamie, and John were the only ones who didn't room with Devin
Nick, rn
Nick, sincere thank you for telling us more than two days in advance when you're going to be in Boston, and reminding us several times along the way. I not be attending the concert but I appreciate the invitation 
Nick, why don't you thank the nurses in that GroupMe 
Nick, you can take all the tattooed women, I'll take all the women with abs. I can fucks with that 
Nick, you owe a lot of people responses to posts you were tagged in
Nickelodeon is right
Nick's on Broadway is also a great pick for best chef NE. 
Nick's team has 4, I think. We have 7, I think. That said, I personally am totally open to hosting Bock and Kristen as long as we hide it from the moderators. I heard they suck

No answer to my question. I win by default 
No app, 3 magmar 
No argument there 
No bby
No because Eli does not possess Fuckhole 🐐 qualities 
No because he only played 69 for the rams and not 70
No because he’s trying to fuck Mahomes 
No because I fixed her
No because if I banned him, I would have to ban @Beanboy  and Kristen too 
No because it shifts position to always face northward
No because they gave up on their backup
No because they'd because reimbursed by insurance companies for a higher % of billed costs. And by negotiating with drug companies with capped prices, they would spend less to fill their pharmacies, so the consumer would be charged less
No because we didn't grow up in western Mass
No becsuse the picture didn't auto-preview. Be better. 
No big deal, but the baby 🐐 at the Franklin park zoo that I posted about last week is named Chewbacca
No Bocker, you can't stay at my place. 
No bocker. I said mentally weak individuals AND darrow, implying that he isn’t included in the aforementioned group 
No Bonds again, somewhere@( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼  is crying
No bow better!
No business trying to run that trick play when you are having success on the ground 
No but Darrow volunteered for them to pay for the network. That's a pretty firm commitment if you ask me. 
No but he doesn't get notifications of messages 
No but I have a Leesa, their competitor
No but I heard @Anthony Goodwin is available 
No but I remember when Morcus couldn’t
No but I sniffed glue today 
No but I take your word for it 
No but if they didn't exist we'd be fucked. That's the point  
No but Jimmy Kimmel is hosting 
No but Kennedy said he'd pick rats and hunters
No but Kristian Wilkerson is
No but seriously I don't know if I will be around. Currently visiting a family friend in the hospital 
No but seriously, is jordan ok 
No but seriously. I want Ryan Allen. 67 net yard punts 
No but that would have been a good guess
No but that would have been pretty incredible 
No but then you don’t have a subpar maps application on your phone 
No but there are a ton around Tufts now. Just haven't gone to catch them 
No but there are threats against Dems that say they'll be primaried if they don't oppose Gorsuch
No but there was a decision you had to make that influenced how the game ended
No but they read the news that gets posted online dumbass
No but we can have beautiful women with palm fronds fan us all day and night. 
No but we can still riot anyway
No chan, I get all my opinions from Reddit. 
No chance Bolt could beat anesto, right? 
No chance Brady gets it, despite probably deserving it. Ryan will win it probably. If not him, Rodgers because people like shitting on him with the packers suck and ducking his dick when they're winning 
No chance it passes the senate as is 
No chance that Jamie isn't blackout right now 
No chance that Marcus didn't hire an arsonist to burn down Johnny Dash's apartment in advance of their fantasy matchup. Marcus's reading ability also explains why the arsonist hit the wrong apartment. 
No chance that Shelbie isn't making a dig at Marcus with that caption 
No chance we lose now 
NO chance you lose 
No chance Zuber gets caught there 
No chick can resist the seduction of a 6'5" 265 lb black dude. I give her 2 months before she can't resist the urge any longer

No coincidence that Adams is on Joe’s team. Worst manager in the league 
No coincidence that liberal Jordan wants to visit the two most liberal areas of Texas. Surprised the military hasn't rubbed off on him
No coincidence that my only losses were to the best fantasy manager ever and the goats
No Colvin was just saying that Bill makes his team practice when it is and isn't ok to bat a ball. There was a game in 2013 against the Dolphins

No hot takes from @Joe Bourque  after this game. Maybe he finally jumped off the Tobin
No I actually like him. She pays less attention to politics than I do, which is saying a lot 
No I didn't mean it like that at all 
No I didn't. How did you find that
No I didn't. I could still lose 
No I don't because I choose to connect with all my good friends through the GroupMe 
No I have a specific recurring nightmare about mobile quarterbacks beating the pats. Started at the Super Bowl last year

No idea how the work environment is
No idea if it fits #MyNarrative or #BocksNarrative but looked cool
No idea if these are from this year or not but I like to think they are. Laugher makes the pain go away. 
No idea it lasted that long 
No idea what that means at this point
"no idea, only read the tweet on /r/baseball

And do you start with a runner on second every inning or just the first one?

No it was a good trade. Push it through
No it won’t. I really can’t dedicate brain space to that individual 
No jags, fuck Joe, fuck Bortles 
No jelly there. There is a place outside providence that does filled donuts but I've only been there once and went for boston creme 
No joe, what's up 
No Joe. It isn't. Stop spreading lies. Obama is with with ISIS AND China 
No Joff. What's wrong with society is that no one is here to make the GroupMe lit.

No Nick on Hulu Live :(
No Nickolas. I do not. Your RAs wrote you up as being a central source. Meaghann knocked on our door to tell us to quiet down because RAs were starting their rounds. She frequently came over to watch sports with us. She would bring us bowls of candy because we were her favorite. 
No no no no 
No no no. MAAV is against domestic and teen dating violence. Face fucking s bunch of fuckholes does not fall into that category 
No no. I mean right now they don't ask for identification when you go to vote. There are people who want to require it 
No not you 
No number could ever lower my # on the pee scale
No offense to Kristen, she is a lovely lady, but I will decline your offer.

No one does, it is ok
No one else cares except for me but Gravedigger got let go from NFL Network due to "budget cuts" 
No one else gives a shit. The university hates them. The student body hates them. 
No one else in the GroupMe wants that to happen so it won't happen. 
No one else is a nerd
No one else is dank enough
No one ever accused Joe of being a good friend 
No one ever said that he was the sharpest knife in the drawer 
No one followed him, that zone was completely empty 
No OnE gOeS iNtO tHe LiNk AnD wInS!!!!
No one got fired. Dan didn’t have his contract renewed but they offered contracts to Marc and Gregg. Part of it was the stuff about the Brady roast that he was told not to say. But part of it is that he had been fighting with the bosses for a while over the creative direction of the show. When Justin got let go, he apparently became very difficult to work with because he was so upset 
No one gunna correct me for saying Lamar Odom 2.0 vs. Greg Oden 2.0?

No one in this groupme has morals 
No one involved was a foxtrot at the time 
No one is in the double bonus yet. How does that factor into this game being over or not?
No one is saying that Caleb wasn't hyped. We are all saying Caleb was hyped, and now he sucks.
No one is suggesting eliminating tertiary care. Just more of an emphasis on primary and secondary care. Better to stop your diabetes before it develops than to treat it when you have it 
No one is superior to you
No one is talking about naco taco....
No one is the boss of Tony 
No one is wearing masks in Portland, ME 
No one knows how to land properly/not roll their ankle worse than tall basketball players whose job it is to jump for rebounds
No one knows who Jeff is 
No one listens to poor jeff anymore 
No one loves Microsoft more than I do. That's why I have a Surface laptop and my wife has a Surface tablet
No one loves Oscar because he is literally a representation of poor people in America. Always mad that they are poor but never doing anything to not be poor. You think Snuffaluffagus is gunna let himself live in a trash can for 30 years? Fuck no.
No one loves the troops more than Joe. After all, he voted for Trump at least 7 times 
No one loves you

No one up early to study from the Gospel of GroupMe on this holy Sunday? 
No one wanted to entertain my opinion so the Sam Bradford hate kind of died down 
No one wants to be the guy who comes after the guy. Everyone wants to be the guy who comes after the guy who comes after the guy 
No one wants to coach the Jags because of Balke 
No one wants to draft before the preseason is over. Last thing you want is for your star player to tear his acl in the last preseason game 
No one wants to indulge in football talk with me in a football groupme :(
No one wants to talk in the GroupMe on a football Sunday unless it involves defending Kirk Cousins. Sad. 
No one wants to win this game 
No one was acting like it was normal not to know who nas was except for the two people who didn't know who nas was 
No one watches videos in the groupme

No way
No way Goody would drive all the way to Western Mass 
No way that that’s sarcasm, unfortunately. 
No way the Chargers win without his heroics
No way this comes back to bite them
No way we would ever lose if we had competent officiating 
No way you can do that on an ambulance that I know of
No woman would see that and think that her subsequent orgasm was unwanted 
No wonder @Skimmer doesn't come here anymore 
No wonder Bocker got rid of him. James White would have made that block
No wonder it got worse 
No wonder Marcus never responded to my text message
No wonder she was traumatized
No wonder Skimmer never comes around here anymore. We got Goody posting KKK advertisements and Morcus spreading facts about the founding 
No wonder the children turned out the way they did 
No wonder we lost 🙄
No wonder why #GoldenShowerGoody voted for Trump twice.
No wonder why @Skimmer hates us and didn’t tell us about his baby

No, but I do think these announcers are shit.
No, but I went to a dog park and am on trial for treason now

No, but we may be billionaires
No, but you'd move it if you were moving into another apartment in Boston
No, Chan. I do not support Karl Marx. I do, however, support Seth Moulton. A three-term Massachusetts representative who completed four tours of duty as a marine in Iraq. A Democrat who has consistently criticized Pelosi for being stuck in her ways and obstructing the progress of the Democratic party. A revolutionary who champions the voice of the younger politicians making their way into office. Someone who has the support from top military minds, who promises to advance social progressive ideals while emphasizing fiscal conservatism. He might not be who this country deserves, but he damn sure is what this country needs.

No. I don’t know what you mean. Could you please explain it to me?
No. I don't believe this. No one is this autistic

No. I hate the objectification of women by betting on their performance instead of celebrating them for the athletes and people they are 
No. I have an exam and then four and a half hours of class after that. That’s some bullshit 
No. I have Celiac tho
No. I meant you're a good person and always were my friend 
No. I said that if the data showed that there was a higher rate of black people selling drugs than white people, it would be because of systemic racism
No. I started him and he just threw a pick in the red zone 
No. I want to hang out Saturday 
No. I was just the victim of all of my players point shaving

No. Let us commence the discussion. 
No. Literally no idea who you are referring to
No. Marcus welcomes your advances

No. No I would not. 
No. No. Just Goody's 
No. No. No. 
No. Nomar is 
No. Once we ban direct to consumer drug advertising, companies will spend billions of dollars less in advertising costs and be able to reinvest that money into more economical means of drug discovery

No. That's blasphemy
No. That's definitely not a thing 
No. That's Kovin

No. This is what Bocker signed up for when he took a job on my office 
No. Torn ligaments.
No. Wait until the 29th to tell everyone

No. Wily Mo Peña
No. You eat chicken breast and broccoli. Don’t make people think that’s what “eating gluten free” means 
No. You just haven't gone in the last two Wednesdays, so I was curious if you went in this week 
No. You made it not funny anymore. 
No. You'll still be allowed to get me coffee in the mornings 
No. You're a quitter. That's even worse. 
No. You're literally Hitler. Like it's not even a question in my mind. 
No. You're supposed to post a high fiving gif
No. Zappe
No?
No? 
No? Okay  
Noah isn't even on the Bulls 
Nobody is mad?! 
Nock Chobb
Nock is definitely the Fuckhole equivalent of PC Principal 
Nock is starting to become like Morcus: only coming in here when he has an agenda to talk about
Nock is the only other woke person in the Fuckholes, confirmed 
Nock just catching a stray 
Noice catch right there 
Nomad got traded and then we won a World Series. Coincidence?!
Nomad is already on the list you dingus
Nomar 
Nomar also didn't help the Cubs win the World Series. If he was a true 🐐, they would have won it three times by now 
Nomar?
Nomar's currency is worth less than the Vietnamese dong (lol)
Nomination officially resubmitted. @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 was always my friend 
Non poors

None of these people are Dean DeRienzo

Not actually 
Not after Mark Wahlberg shot him in the leg in yankee stadium 
Not after this Tidal disaster 
Not aggressive enough. You need to ruin someone's life to get off the hook 
Not all cops are bad. Individually yelling at cops won't change things. The system is built in a way to take advantage of inequities suffered by PoC and other vulnerable populations. That said, I do think it is incumbent on every police officer to recognize the power disparity and work to change it. There are a lot of police officers who are doing that and sharing in the frustrations with the system. I hope peaceful protests continue until every town has police officers walking in marches and taking a knee with protesters.

Not disclosing 120 million in shared revenue that was supposed to be split among the the players 
Not drinking coffee daily is definitely a weird person move. You and bocker can't convince me otherwise
Not eating 6 course meals every day
Not enough TEs on the field for BB
Not enough time
Not even a little bit 
Not even a little bit 
Not even a little fun 😔
Not even a yard 
not even Chubb
Not even close 
Not even Jboss, because he drinks the same number of beers as his borhter (none)
Not even showing the replay 
Not even top 20. Fucking scrub 
Not everybody
Not everyone can be Team @#JustFacts✅
Not everyone can diagnose an MI that everyone misses. I am just not the med student that you are
Not everyone follows that rule 
Not everyone has a second tv to put the game on in the background while they watch TWL S3 (NO SPOILERS)
Not everyone. I was always a doubter. The record will prove that
Not fixed
Not for Drake Maye, who I presume was perfect 
Not for long 
Not for me
Not for some of us
Not for you. Happy birthday @Skimmer 
Not forgetting, just leaving him off the list 
Not giving a citizen a fair trial is also unconstitutional BUT THATS WHAT THE SECOND CIRCUIT JUST DID TO BRADY
Not gluten free. Thanks for not thinking about my needs 
Not go to lone star 
Not going to a subreddit doesn't count as skimming
Not going to a women's sporting event 
Not going to even consider reading that, but I want the author to know that I'm already pretty set for retirement. Got that $10,800 saved up 
Not going to lie chan, had no idea you didn't drink. I appreciate having this opportunity to learn more about who you are as a person 
Not going to lie, a little butthurt about that 
Not going to lie, as a non rap fan, I couldn't name a meek mill or chance the rapper song 
Not going to lie, didn't see Jordan as a dude who doesn't fuck but I guess the Starcraft should have clued me in
Not going to lie, I kind of lol'd when the Steelers started testing positive after spending the week complaining about how the Ravens and the nfl fucked over their schedule because they never have any issues
Not going to lie, I saw the John Lewis news this morning when I was coming home from my overnight. My first reaction was, "wow, I thought he died last year. I guess maybe he just retired and that's the news I remember?" 
Not going to lie, I thought this was the name of the salt bae guy
Not going to lie, thought this was a TV show that I had never heard of
Not going to lie, when season 1 came out, I thought it was going to be a comedy about two famous American actors who bought a middling UK football team 
Not going to lie. The first two days were hard. He wanted nothing to do with her. The third day, they played in the yard for like an hour and they haven't stopped playing since 
Not going to spoil anything. 
Not good 
Not good enough wine
Not good. 
Not good. He stole it from ESPN. Fuck them
Not great company 
Not great run blocking
Not great, but not impossible 
NOT GUILTY 
Not having a league is the best
Not having email on your phone might be the most outrageous thing that Darrowball has ever done, and that's saying a lot 
Not having enough money --> funding a trip to the moon for you and your closest friends
Not having Up in your top 5 is like thinking Nomar is more 🐐 than Andrew Jackson 
Not his first time either
Not hot. Literally as cold as ice cream 
Not I 
Not I feel like an extra asshole 
Not if a 3.6 trillion dollar industry collapses under the weight of astronomical healthcare utilization
Not if a receiver is there 
Not if amendola is back 
Not if fitzmagic has anything to say about it 
Not if he plays in the coveted TE/QB2 spot
Not if it's Joe doing the raping. 
Not if you believe the "BC isn't in Boston" trope 
Not if you didn't watch the video, it doesn't 
Not if you eat all six meals at once
Not if you kill yourself you're not
Not in the groupme 
Not in the groupme 
Not in the groupme, doesn’t count 
Not in the groupme, doesn't count
Not in the GroupMe, doesn't count
Not in the GroupMe. Didn't count 
Not in the last few hours 
Not in the playoffs. Darrow had the most wins. 
Not in this GroupMe, thus not your buddy 
Not inaccurate
Not including last game, 47 targets without a touchdown. He had one called back due to penalty last week but I don't know how many targets he ended the game with 
Not including the colts is a little biased, I will admit. The bills d scares me and if tyrod Taylor can just avoid fucking up, they have a solid offensive squad. The Bears have forte and Jeffrey but I don't see them going anywhere with cutler and they have a piss poor d
Not interceptions 
Not interested. I'm sticking with Joe. Did you know he's won two Fuckhole championships?
Not itchy yet but I would 100% rub my poison ivy residue all over you 
Not JJ and Caroline tho 
Not Joe. Every time we miss something, he will say, "I thought about that but was only 20% sure." Morcus would "well actually" every answer your team picks. JBoss can't deal with paintballs, so no chance he can handle the pressure of the Feud. John would lose his voice halfway through the show and not be able to participate. Darrow would definitely be deep dicking the production assistant during Final Feud.
Not just any city, a city with very expensive rental costs
Not just because I disagree with his politics, but just for the shear irony. And also so I didn't have to see his face anymore 
Not just prostate exams. There are standardized patients for pretty much everything. Patient interviewing, physical exams, rectal exams, breast exams, pelvic exams, etc 
Not keeping Antonio Brown was the best decision of the groupme. He's bound to decline any year now
Not knocking anything they said in those tweets, but not really gunna take their negative comments about Evans as gospel. He is very well respected in both law enforcement and community rights circles
Not knowing the right answer has never prevented any Fuckholes from answering my question 
Not legally binding 
Not like DC amirite
Not like him to not complain to the groupme how much he hates fantasy
Not like the Giants Mara. She is the Giants Mara. 
Not like you needed those points
Not liking a reference to the tennis ball of justice and bailing on a boiz golf trip....did @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) enroll in B school?
Not liking super beefs with extra sauce '
Not liking that Bennett only got $6.15m APY for three years from Green Bay. I think that could have been in the Pats price range 
Not lit, the GroupMe is
Not literally
Not loading^
Not losing votes from their base who won't be happy if they don't fight trump to the bitter end 
Not LT 
Not mad, just praying that everyone gets some sort of amoeba 
Not making your company too big or too small
Not Marky Mark though, because he left the super bowl early and capitalizes off of tragedies 
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me 
Not me 
Not me 
Not me because you stopped inviting me on your team after freshman year
Not me forgetting that your mother goes by Dr. Morris 
Not me though
Not me yelling at the TV that that was a live fucking ball 
Not me. 
Not me. I can make it!
Not me. I have always been on the opposite side as Marcus on this issue
Not me. I have heard enough about the situation to form my opinion
Not me. I love the troops 
Not me. I'm always hard
Not me. I'm still dead inside. 
Not Morcus’s
Not much different from your normal day 
Not much else. Just cool if you like running. It's at hynes all weekend. 9a-6pm 
Not much of a threat 
Not my fault he's too slow to take advantage of the opportunity
Not my fault if you have stupid dreams 
Not my fault that Brian went into marketing instead of deciding to pursue a career that helped people
Not my fault that every other pats "fan" in this GroupMe sucks 
Not my fault that Goody decided to use a fake email for a liability waiver that specifically tells you that you have to confirm via email. 
Not my fault that you aren't taking your vacation this week like I am 
Not my fault you didn't look at your schedule to see when you were playing me before you traded 
Not my fault you jinxed it
Not my narrative
Not my narrative 
Not my narrative 
Not Ned Devine's 
Not nice to call John's woman "a horse" 
Not Nook Coffee House in East Greenwich, RI. They suggested that Taylor may be a special guest 
Not on the list 
Not on the orange line. That's the nicest line of them all 
Not one announced as of yet
Not one I would ever trust near my genitalia
Not only did he win in 2013 and 2015, but came in second in 2016 and now second in 2019 and won the NYC Marathon in 2018.
Not only did that kick suck, but it didn't even end the half 
Not only did you skim the original post, but you skimmed me tagging you last night asking about it 
Not only does he leave plates out for other people to clean, but he throws his trash in recycling bins
Not only does he not have to work, but he doesn't even have to go to school. My taxes are really going to good use....
Not only is he in prison, but he is in the prison a mile from foxboro
Not only is joe popular enough to have almost 90 likes on his new fb profile pic in the hour it has been up, but he also had a current nfl player comment on it 
Not our fault they don't coach clutchness 
Not our fault you can't help from peeing on yourself 
Not our league, doesn't matter 
Not overlooked #TopHalfAintBad
Not packed by Kristen 
Not playing 
Not proud of the time but longest distance in like a year 
Not pushed back from the last communications we were given 
Not quite, but almost got it 
Not really breaking news, but Reebok is moving its headquarters to the Seaport. Nice to see major companies moving into Boston 
Not really. If you're bold enough, you can hike from the top of Spruce Peak, around the top to the top of Smuggs. Smuggs used to sell single lift tickets so you could cross over from Spruce to Smuggs, ski down, take the lift back up, and then cross back over to Spruce
Not rich enough
Not ripped enough to be Darrow 
Not ruling it out. I would be less surprised if it was him spoiling the surprise that BB was going to show up before the show that got him in trouble though 
Not saying he’s right, just saying it’s a 🔥 take 
Not saying I'm mad, but how did I get pegged for blueberry lavender ice cream? I have never had such a creation in my life
Not saying it's causal, but he got a blood clot in his leg last week 
Not saying that Emyr did anything wrong, but privately calling dibs and handing him the team means zero input from the league, which is not consistent with past precedence 
Not showing my face. Ian that the best thing I can do? 
Not significant. Joe is a liar 
Not so much thirsty as probably mentally insane
Not specific to our group 
Not specifically addressed, so I assume that it's fine 
Not suited for ED Lyfe?
Not sure #2 knows that he was called for PI 
Not sure Bocker's Reese's-only nutrition plan puts him at much of an advantage.
Not sure he's worth $30 but I don't see anything wrong with jboss spending that much to try and get someone that will maybe make a difference the last few games 
Not sure how accurate the source is but a quick google search says 13.4% of college students interviewed 
Not sure how anyone can be happy that our team is definitively playing worse than Syracuse
Not sure how anyone these days flies without choosing an airline that has free inflight wifi on every flight. That's Marcus's real problem.
Not sure how Jamie Collins didn't get flagged for jumping the line on that missed field goal 
Not sure how JBoss expects me to afford that. I'd have to sacrifice eating for at least 3 days
Not sure how Marble League 2022 didn't light a fire in here
Not sure how Money Mitch isn't concussed 
Not sure how old that news is 
Not sure how that isn't a normal shooting motion
Not sure how they overcame all those penalties
Not sure how you can call yourself a man after getting manhandled like that on that play
Not sure how you refuse to believe that. Remember the whole "change the draft night/location" situation 
Not sure how you repeatedly tase a police officer and not get shot 
Not sure how you would know that, but I feel like I don't want to ask 
Not sure I could do it while attempting to stuff my gastrointestinal tract with literal poison 
Not sure if anyone has tried to fry Adam Gase yet 
Not sure if chan is making a joke or just doesnt know how to spell my last name 
Not sure if Steelers are playing defense
Not sure if this is why Jordan posted about it this morning, but the protests in central square that I posted about were pro-$15 protestors 
Not sure if true, but I read on Twitter that McCain was against this repeal, again because of the process. 
Not sure if you can trust Bocker. Why don't you go ahead and send me that money so I can try it out
Not sure if you were there, Anthony. I just remember most of the room going and then then telling us (pretty sure Darrow also got shafted) that they couldn’t bring everyone and we were the odd men out 
Not sure I'm in a position to talk shit to goody 
Not sure it’s a good idea to just announce that a player’s wife is in labor on national tv when the player doesn’t even know...
Not sure my roommate Kovin is laying out much these days
Not sure that either Trey Flowers hit or Logan Ryan not turning around were clear 
Not sure that the penguins are going to appreciate you checking their Fuckholes, Kevin. But you do you. 
Not sure they'll put flacco in. Doesn't seem smart to replace the rookie who WILL be on the team next year with someone who won't be on the team next year when they likely aren't going to win regardless
Not sure what Aaron Jones did to get trapped in the doghouse...
Not sure what place you're referring to but the Powells live in Somerville 
Not sure what that adds up to because I'm too lazy/stupid to do basic math 
"Not sure what the occasional would mean but:
Bifrontal - bilateral frontal lobe?
Nonspecific - unknown etiology
White matter foci - hyperenhancement of certain areas of the brain, showing increased whiteness on MRI or CT scan. Normally white matter is composed of myelinated axons, so if there are foci, it means there are focal areas that are more white than the rest of the white matter"
Not sure what the other video is all about 
Not sure what this has to do with <18 year olds though
Not sure what to make of this chief complaint 
Not sure what you mean
Not sure what you're talking about. He's showing pure grit by going out there
Not sure when I will see you next becks 
Not sure which one of you wants to lose more 
Not sure who Alston is, but thanks for the feedback
Not sure why I thought I could beat the best fantasy manager in league history
Not sure why we don't trust that Darrow shot a 36
Not sure why we keep trusting John. He keeps telling me my answers are wrong.
Not sure why you bring out something like that in this week. Save it for a game that matters 
Not sure why you need to bring your phone with you to JJ's room. You could just leave it plugged in by your bed 
Not sure why you would want to live in Poo York instead of Boss-ton
Not sure yet but I will let you know if they end up listing it
Not sure you can even call what Bocker does here "work" 
Not sure you're even on the rankings anymore 
Not sure. All I heard was ptostitution 
Not sure. Just picked the first gif
Not surprised 
Not surprised if gronk, patricia, and earnie Adams were all crated in a secrete belichick lab
Not surprised that you are first in line to get deep throated
Not surprised. I always heard that he had a nice CoC
Not tagging any specific Hotel member 
NOT TAKING A POLITICAL STAND, JUST ADDING A PIECE OF CONTEXT THAT I HEARD. NOT ARGUING ANYTHING. NOT ENGAGING IN DISCUSSION
Not TBDB tho
Not thanks to you
Not that Alex Smith would have saved them, but it’s a bad look if they really wanted him 
Not that Anthony Goodwin. The other @Anthony Goodwin 
Not that anyone cares, but I'm going through some of my grandpa's old military service papers to try and request replacements for all his medals 
Not that anyone cares, but the Mumford and Noah Kahan concert I invited you all to was incredible
Not that anyone was questioning his manhood
Not that happy 
Not that hard 
Not that I care about basketball, but I kind of thought that I wanted the warriors to win again. However seeing them get boned by the raptors is kind of enjoyable 
Not that I care, but if I did care, which, just to be clear, j don't, what's the deal with this Ime Udoka trade 
Not that I recall 
Not that I should care because it works for me, but Marcus shouldn't lose points for that pick 6. Pats d is penalized for giving up 14 points. 
Not that I trust a word he says, but Albert Breer reporting that Mayo is on the hot seat after throwing AVP under the bus 
Not that I watched that video
Not that it applies to today, but landscapers waking you up at 7 am with their leaf blowers is the worst part about living in the suburbs
Not that it matters now 
Not that it would have made a difference, but have some awareness
Not that Kraft would have spent the money to get a big name anyway 
Not that much of a discount, but $200 less for the whole trip
Not that play
Not that play. It's coming though. Book it. 
Not that that really helps haha
Not that that's an excuse. If you're getting maced, you're probably being an asshole and deserve to be maced 
Not the best punt 
Not the best view but going off of Goody's description, you can tell who is based on their actions 
Not the first time I disappointed Bock Boi 
Not the happy ending place in Revere, @The Big Dick Bandit 
Not the Joe "Boston College Boi" Bourque story tho 
Not the kind that you get out of the vending machine and the chocolate is already mottled and slightly melted
Not the Watt brothers lol 
Not the world's biggest buzzy buzz fan but I'll deal with it
Not there yet
Not this again 
Not this guy either 
Not this past draft. They took Stidham last year
Not this week obviously 
Not this year. Not last year. Not any year. 
Not tipping in Italy was fucking sick
Not to be confused with da boiz
Not to be confused with the 🍑👋🏻
Not to class
Not to goody. He sees nothing wrong. 
Not to mention breaking into a closed park
Not to mention he also compares nhl to ufc viewership 
Not to mention how he handled the Wentz situation this year, which was not ideal
Not to mention people shift the d line all the fucking time on like every play, why would it be any different on the goal line
Not to mention someone else beat Darrow this year
Not to mention that John already responded to you 
Not to mention the bot debacle. He won't even spend money for the good of the program. What do you think he's going to do when it comes to hire a coach 
Not to mention the part of the colon, gallbladder, and liver they removed 
Not to mention the second pack of hot dogs I didn't cook 
Not to mention the Yawkey family was one of the most racists sports owner groups in history. Last baseball team to have a black athlete 
Not to mention trying to find a new place to live
Not to mention, 5 people on board. Which means Kobe + pilot = 3 people. So how can all four daughters be on board if there are only 3 other people
Not to mention, just because you don't have an event on your calendar doesn't mean you don't have stuff to do during that time 
Not to mention, y’all are clearly over exaggerating the injury. Nothing at all like Paul George or Kevin Ware. Kevin Ware has a bone sticking out of his shin. Paul George snapped his entire leg in half 
Not to play the "if you saw what I see" card, but I really wish you guys could see what we see 
Not to rehash an old argument, but cider was always sweet when it was first made. Sweet cider (the kind that Bocker likes) tastes like shit and eventually people realized that and actual cider makers do everything they can to not make cider like that. The true cider community uses much less sugar and incorporates some pretty dope flavors into ciders. I've had ciders that taste like IPAs, ciders that are more generally just hopped, ciders aged in wine barrels, cider in rum/whiskey barrels, cider infused with tequila, cider made with botanicals, jalapeno cider, etc. It's not all jolly rancher flavor, it's not all intensely sweet, and I will do everything in my power to disown cider makes like Angry Orchard
Not to sound anti-politics, but I think the political system has really created a whole new political party by suppressing bipartisanship. There are a lot of people who believe in small government and fiscal conservativeness but can't morally vote republican because they seem so behind on social issues. Then you have people like trump who spit off arguably racist remarks about immigrants and it further pushes people away from the party. Then you have democrats promising to give handouts to everyone and reward people for not working hard enough to make a living wage and promoting big government spending financed by taxes. 
Not today
Not today. I save that for Fridays 
Not true. Darrow voted yes 
Not true. My dad started as a gym teacher, worked his way up to an assistant principal. Ended his career making 90k. He worked more during the summer than teachers, but 90k/year is pretty decent 
Not tryna be a homer but that's a pretty bad call 
Not until they legalize steroids 
Not watching, game being recorded 
Not we personally, but those with the power to affect change 
Not wearing a helmet is going to exterminate @Beanboy. Doesn't need Nazis for that 
Not when the commissioner strikes this trade down
Not with that attitude he's not
Not with that attitude you couldn't
Not with that attitude you couldn't 
Not with the best QB in the league 
Not with Trump in office
Not without completely guessing 
Not without you here 
Not work hours 
Not work hours, so no NSFW tag 
Not work pants, but if you want to be the most comfortable you've ever been, I would recommend Sunday performance joggers from.Vouri 
Not worth owning in fantasy and will be irrelevant in a year
Not Wyoming 
Not yet
Not yet 
Not yet, but hes still going
Not yet. I don't want to lose the magic
Not you
Not you
Not you 
Not you Chan. You're the only smart one to get out of this entanglement years ago
Not you. 
Not you. I know you'd know it because it's about your people 
Not you. Not everything is about you 
Not you. The bengals
Not yours.
Not Zappe's fault that his receivers can't catch 100% of the throws

Nothing 
Nothing about that article matters except the title
Nothing about that would be temporary. I couldn't see anything ever again after seeing a body so pure and perfect 
Nothing about the Fuckholes fits the description "humble"
Nothing but straight shooters who know what they are talking about on that site
Nothing can be worse than your murder of the bots 
Nothing can hope to be as white as white bread. 
Nothing good about Luck retiring....except more Jake Brisket drops on Around the NFL 
Nothing important happens at 5 am. If you go to bed at 9, you miss everything that happens at night 
Nothing is better than seasons 1-3 of Arrested Development so there is no need to watch any other sitcom
Nothing is good about Papa Gino's except it is better than Domino's
Nothing is more 🐐 like than carrying a bullet embedded in your chest right next to your hear for the rest of your life 
Nothing is stopping you from hanging out with us at 11 pm, goody 
Nothing like a broken pinky though
Nothing like a good case of the office blue balls to start off your Sunday
Nothing makes me happier than Bocker being butt hurt that I am good at connections without cheating
Nothing makes me happier than seeing Jordan happy about the Dodgers being unhappy
Nothing matters except for the final score
Nothing matters for me. I'm dead inside 
Nothing matters. Baseball is dead (until the Red Sox make the world series this year) 
Nothing of consequence happened, I'm sure 
Nothing official from BAA, but lots of local media outlets reporting that the marathon will be postponed, as we expected 
Nothing says black lives matter like unemployed white people blocking productive citizens from getting to work on time. 
Nothing says freedom of speech like arresting a black, credentialed, news reporter live on air
Nothing says Guido like "John Thompson"
Nothing surprises me anymore
Nothing to see here 
Nothing to see here 
Nothing will be commercially available for at least a year, even with expedited approval and funding
Nothing will happen and we will forget about it by tomorrow
Nothing wrong with girls being taller than you 
Nothing wrong with perpetually settling for 2nd-6th place
Nothing you said is incorrect in any part of this statement 
Nothing, I just felt that Jordan's explanation of Donny slurping the secret service did not adequately explain what Donny was referring to
Nothing. Jeff spent this morning vomiting in the er 
Notice how @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim  has been silent after Herbert's win
Notice how Goody wanted to talk to his friends but cannot engage in the conversation because his meal prep is 100% chicken breast and broccoli
Notice how he didn't even come in to defend himself?
Notice how he passes on the salutation from Frankie immediately...
Notice how I didn’t use that term 
Notice how Morcus has been silent regarding the despicable outcome of today's game and regarding the denouncement of basketball
Notice how the school moved up after he left...
Notice that I didn't edit my post 
Notre dame down to #6
Notre Dame is a trash football team. What a joke. UCF would have been much better competition 
Notre dame is bad 
Notre Dame quarterback throws a bomb 60 yard td and then gets carted off with what looks like a break or a high ankle sprain. Sucks to suck 
Notre Dame 🐩
Notre Dame?
Notre LAME

""Yeah but you're wrong."" - Marcus "
Now I know why Jordan is contemplating going back to led school 
Now I know why the Pats never traded for him 
Now I know you're lying since you said john is a fan 
Now I love @#JustFacts✅ again
Now I see like eight sources from 5 minutes ago. Definitely reinstated 
Now I shift my focus to Kevin. You are a great player who I respect immensely and I look forward to our competition this week. 
Now I'm actually going to vomit 
Now I'm bad
Now I'm getting mixed signals
Now I'm not
Now I'm not saying that socialism is good, but I support a system where goody directly gives me all of his money
Now I'm sitting here hungry and sad 
Now I'm standing at a poster that no one is going to come to see until I take it down at 1 pm and run back to the airport. It's lit. 
Now it's 3:08
Now it's going to be ruined. Fuck
Now it's in the GroupMe 
Now it's the tmz of sports 
Now I've got Lorde, Chan, and Darrow RSVPed so I guess I actually have to throw a party

Now Jordan is not only wrong, but he's just plain lying 
Now just about anyone can drink a bud light from Stanleys
Now look at you, selling khakis at discounts so big, they should be criminal

Now only if Kobe would retire too. 
Now only will Bocker's future children be cursed with the Bock Boi genome, but they are gunna be dirt poor. 
Now people freak out that they can't charge their iPads or watch general hospital if the power goes out 
Now that I think about it, I wasn't even there. Maybe it wasn't about charter schools. 
Now that it's officially official. 
Now that I've beaten that dumb Harry Potter game
Now that I've made that comparison, I will open myself up to comments from Goody about how fucking stupid that sounds 
Now that Star Wars is owned by Disney, @Chank Hill is the biggest Disney slut, right? 
Now that that gif has loaded for me, I see that #10 might be USA so ignore those last two guesses 
Now that that gif has loaded for me, I see that #10 might be USA so ignore those last two guesses 
Now that that's gone, if the president and the senate are both of the same party, it's essentially impossible to block a president's SCOTUS nominee unless a senator defects
Now that that's settled, will we debate next year's punishment?
Now that you mention it, you're right. My name does make me sound black.
Now that you're in the GroupMe, I don't recognize you as separate people
Now that 🐐 Steven Wright might not pitch again this season, we might be in trouble 
Now that's a headline. No clickbait. Tells me exactly what I need to know without clicking into it.

Now we know the real reason for Chan moving....
Now we know what Goody did in Cabo 
Now we know what he was working on the last few days
Now were you also naked
Now you can all see that me posting the toad memes was just an attempt to coerce Darrow to post them again himself 
Now you don't know what's true. 
Now you have his life story 
Now you have to throw on 3rd 
Now you read something contradictory 
Now you'll only beat me by 35 instead of 45 
Now your methods section is incorrect
Now you're just being rude. Is that how you get what you want?

Now, some of you may say that's sort of skewed because the jags first season was 1995. To that, I would say go fuck yourself 
Now, those same people aren't cheering for Uconn, but something needs to happen to the program. I am just hoping that a loss would be a real wake up call

NPR money, Freakonomics, Embedded, Stuff You Should Know, Radiolab (this one is more sciencey), This American Life are all pretty good. Not sure if they're topics that interest you but they're all pretty popular. There's a new NFL podcast "the Ringer NFL Show", hopefully that turns out to be good 
NPR reported this morning that they have 22 republicans in the house saying they'll vote no. They only needed 21 to sink the bill

NY
"NY 4.35%
CT 3.90%

MA is 4 with 3.51%"
NY is number 1. Mass and CA are not in the top three 
NYC smells weird 
NYE is unmistakably the worst holiday of the year 
NYT 
NYT app
NYT buying wordle is the equivalent of all the bag holders buying Gamestop stock. Wordle creators are gunna be rich and NYT is going to be left holding for the next launch to the moon that will never come 
Nyt has Cruz ahead of Beto by 7.7% with 70% reporting. 
NYT has it down to 50.4-49.0 with 87% reporting. Lamb in the lead still but he’s lost a good chunk of his lead in the last 15 minutes 
NYT has Jones down by only 9k votes with 81% in 
NYT is telling me that I didn't do wordle yesterday so I lost my 91 day streak
NYT single handedly ruined print and online journalism
NYT still has Harris 92% 
NYT wordle is the best wordle 
O line has been trash

Obama and John Kerry made a deal with iran that they would stop their nuclear program and we would list sanctions. Trump campaigned that he would pull out of the deal. Dems are upset because it was a deal Obama made, and allegedly Iran was following the deal. They also argue that NK won't have a reason to trust us if we try and make a deal with them. 
Obama did it first
Oberlin in Providence is also a good choice 
Obesity 
Obesity is considered >30
OBJ called Ray Lewis for advice after the game last night. Probably not the best role model to look up to 
OBJ is mine now 
Obj over McCoy 
OBJ to Pats confirmed 
Objection, clearly Darrowball is not going to be an effective leader. He's going to be spending all his free time banging chicks on the set of the bachelor 
Objection, I believe that Emily Clark had already proven her capability to be an integral member of the Fuckholes. No offense nick, but how do we know that you can live up to the Fuckhole name?
Objectively an uncool, story bro. Please don't tell it again
Objectively bad.
Objectively one of the best in the business. He's not even loved because of the homer fan base like Jack Edwards 
Objectively the west coast of the country 
Objectively the worst season for sure 
Objectively untrue 
Objectively weird
Obligatory "he should have tried to catch it with one hand"
Obligatory: "Norman got so far in OBJ's head he rented real estate."
Obvi the parrot is just parroting. That's the joke 
Obviously 
Obviously a bad defense since Tampa bay sucks 
Obviously an alcohol fermented from fruit is going to have sugar in it. There is a difference between a cider like downeast that back sweetens there cider with additional sugar and off-dry to dry ciders that the natural sweetness. I'm not going to say that all cider isn't sweet because it's true, but I can tell you personally that the reason I enjoy cider is not because of the "pound of sugar" in it
Obviously being a doctor pays a lucrative salary, but I don't consider that being rich. To me, becoming truly rich takes time and an understanding of the system that I don't have. I would be happy to live comfortably, support a family, and save adequately for the future
Obviously Brady makes calls at the line but the original play comes from Josh
Obviously but admitting that wouldn't be fun 
Obviously can't buy into the significance of a single day
Obviously every black QB shouldn't be a receiver. Lamar should be a running back 
Obviously he had to plant in an unsuspecting patsy like Ryan for the long con to work 
Obviously I am being sarcastic. But I have no sympathy for these people 
Obviously I am overstating the cause and effect relationship here, but there are some places trying to make meaningful change and they seem to have the support, rather than the ire, of the community
Obviously I am playing on legendary and going through the whole game only bashing enemies and not shooting
Obviously I asked about refugees so I could figure out if hot chicks would come to us or if we had to go and conquer their land. Not sure why that was too difficult for you to follow goody 
Obviously I know that getting #MeToo'd is when your friend says "I want to get some tacos" and you say "me too"
Obviously I was being sarcastic. I stool without an issue. My fiber intake is adequate 
Obviously I would. Miles Emmanuel Bridges Sr. is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association. He played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans.
Obviously it won't be much use 
Obviously it's a lot more complicated than that and there is probably a lot that I don't understand at all
Obviously it's North of the Panhandle. Everyone knows that without googling it 
Obviously LCR is a dice game called Left Center Right
Obviously looks worse than either of those two pictures. The person in those pictures is hot as fuck 
Obviously none of that is going to happen but I needed to consult with my intelligence officer 
Obviously not a Patriots fan
Obviously not, considering your current investing performance 
Obviously people get paid a lot of money to figure this shit out, and I have to cede that they might potentially know more about what they're doing than I do
Obviously semi-circle tho 
Obviously short 
Obviously small sample size based on anecdotal experiences 
Obviously stolen from Reddit 
Obviously supported by the leagues biggest stan 
Obviously that is still going to appeal primarily to the left-leaning, but it is far less divisive than defund the police.
Obviously the OL is terrible but jfc Caleb is so bad at dealing with pressure 
Obviously the Pats need to run it back with the same crew when it was clear they were outmatched 
Obviously the previous pictures that I posted were doctored. Here is an actual image of the crowd
Obviously the same as the nfl player 
Obviously those are very simplified explanations of some complicated questions 
Obviously those stats don't paint a whole picture of his production 
Obviously unrelated to the protests, but a republican representative who was present and arguing against certification tested positive for covid last night. I really hope the whole chamber doesn't get it
Obviously we weren't there, but based on the media reports, he suffered a cessation of his heart beat which would have prevented him from having any blood flow to his vital organs until his heart was restarted. Had he not gotten prompt treatment, he would be dead
Obviously whiskey priest has the loud music downstairs but if you get outside, it's not that loud and is a nice spot to chill and drink 
Obviously you can't give out a medication if it's unsafe but I think more people will end up dying from not getting vaccinated because of this
Ocarina of Time has a 3d world and a fishing area that you could fish in for hours

Of course @Skimmer isn't a real lawyer, he hasn't taken the Bar yet. @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 would know that if he came to our Fuckhole dinner. 
Of course Bocker picked out the hat himself. He never goes out of style 
Of course goody is supporting domestic terrorism by buying a Kia
Of course he is. He's Joe's classmate's ideal presidential candidate
Of course he waited to call the time out!!!!!!
Of course he's innocent until proven guilty in court, but 12 lawsuits all alleging variations of the same thing is a v bad look
Of course I am rooting for BC to win. I am not a poop head. But at the same time, I think it is reasonable to acknowledge that we aren't going anywhere meaningful with Daz and I just want this awful 7-5 roller coaster to be over 
Of course I did 
Of course I do
Of course I do. But maybe you should tell the GroupMe about it in case they forgot 
Of course I do. I'm the leader of the alt right 
Of course it's not serious. The dude got paid more to play less minutes with a team that could win it all. Can't hate on that 
Of course Joe wants to sign an over the hill running back who proved he can handle 30 carries a game while amassing <3 yards per attempt and still can’t pass block or catch out of the backfield. Just what our offense needs 
Of course Johnny Double Dash throwing a like on that Insta post 
Of course not
Of course not, the fix is in
Of course not. He let him suffer
Of course that restaurant, which I can identify solely by the dish you ate several years ago, still exists 
Of course the chiefs win 
Of course what goody said is fucked up, but I'm not going to get any benefit from getting my panties in a bunch every time he says something politically incorrect. It's not going to stop goody from saying fucked up shit, so I just shrug it off at this point 
Of course Wolf wasn't going to move players for draft assets 
Of course you are. You have to manage that athletic department budget
Of course your debts are paid, you don't pay for labor. 
Of course, Joe is such an idiot. Bears hibernate half the year. He's already lost
Of course, let me know if that changes and I'll call and ask to add you guys to the reservation 
Of fucking course

Oh damn I love the hashtag
Oh damn. The whole game dun just changed
Oh Dan...
Oh dang, we got a nerd-off
Oh dang, you up there
Oh definitely not. Didn't mean to imply that. I miss her like hell. But I am not disappointed with Erica any more
Oh didn't start sanders 
Oh don't get me wrong, I am happy to celebrate the birth of the who people giving me a run for worst fantasy football manager ever, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both filthy skimmers
Oh Doug 🤢
Oh forgot to mention. Found Macoun apples in whole foods yesterday. Truly a victory for Joff
Oh fuck

Oh fuck me. 
Oh fuck that 
Oh fuck, just looked at the Arizona score 
Oh fuck. That's an L
Oh fumble touchback
Oh god I hope so 
Oh god I saw that the other day. 
Oh god Sam Darnold.
Oh god they was hard 
Oh god they're having a march to deliver demands to the university president. Including a letter saying that graduate student workers are unionizing
Oh god why. We went almost all day without basketball 
Oh god, Joe has faith again 
Oh god. Look at Bocker posting snaps of him studying 
Oh good, it's not showing up on my computer
Oh good, not a leg injury. Just a big hit 
Oh goody, I got to watch them have their hearts ripped out 
Oh gosh I am looking at a list right now and it is pretty sad
Oh gotcha. I misunderstood
Oh great. The last thing we needed was a Thompson to be more robotic.
Oh Hekker got everyone sick you say?
Oh he's hurt?
Oh hey Becker, I almost forgot 
Oh hey, I have a chance for my kicker to have the ball to kick a field goal. Nope I am going to fumble trying to get meaningless yards and give two points to john 
Oh hi Marcus 
Oh how does one buy likes. Asking for a friend
Oh I agree with you 100%. I just don’t agree with the reasoning in the study 
Oh I agree. Just trying to interpret what others may be thinking
Oh I already know. Don't worry 
Oh I am way behind you guys 
Oh I assumed you were suggesting he steal the nomination because trump is a 🐩. I didn't hear any of his speech 
Oh I believe him 
Oh I can't do 530. Can we do 537?
Oh I don't have it on in the background
Oh I get it. Bocker doesn't want us to murder him and steal frank and Ricky 
Oh I gotchu now
Oh I guess he was drafted cheap 
Oh I guess the names disappeared. That's an L for me 
Oh I have like a month. But I have my first deans meeting about it in 9 minutes 
Oh I haven’t learned to do that yet. I just know how to test for a shoulder dislocation. 
Oh I like this. Turning it off of me and onto Marcus
Oh I prefer that narrative
Oh I put Chandler Jones twice. That was unintentional
Oh I see now. So the building top-left to the brown building is Higgins and the one that rounds out that square is Devlin
Oh I was planning on shitting in his gas tank 
Oh I would totally care in either of those scenarios, jordan. I'm just saying that maybe wade is a bitch, but I'd be a bitch too if I suddenly became black and athletic and merged bodies with him 
Oh I’m definitely voting for him
Oh Ian...
Oh I'm sure he's blowing a lot 
Oh I'm sure she did. 
Oh I'm well aware 
Oh it doesn't. I'm not arguing with you that that's it's purpose or that it should be funded for those reasons. If anything, I'm back on the "insurance sucks because it doesn't cover enough of the costs"
Oh it was JMac who didn't jump
Oh it's pro-Drake? Fuck that. Dude got fucked up in a rap battle and goes tattling to the legal system. Dude straight up sucks 
Oh Jimmy 😍

Oh look. Brady shook hands with Mahomes 
Oh looking at it again yeah it looks like something his it
Oh man that's a throwback 
Oh man, The Indicator from Planet Money must be growing crazy right now
Oh man, well I feel like an idiot! I can't believe I accused you of such a thing
Oh Miami 🙄
Oh motherfucking shit.
Oh my bad. Didn't read past the first column 
Oh my bad. I did it quickly and didn’t notice. 
Oh my fuck
Oh my god he got murdered
Oh my god that is gold 
Oh my God, poor Chan
Oh my god. Fucking Jets

Oh please. You worked in a group for 75% of your assignments. 
Oh poor Elizabeth 
Oh poor Trace
Oh random girl looked at me at school? Sploosh 
Oh right, I came out on the next gen consoles. I only had PS2 at the time, and they released CoD3: Big Red One for PS2. It was dog shit

OH SHIT

OH SHIT
OH SHIT 
Oh shit guys, I have some HUGE news
Oh shit it was actually colonized by the us 
Oh shit wrong one
Oh shit you're right. This is the Fuckholes. My bad becks. I was just so distraught by not having you hear all day 
Oh shit you're right. What I meant to say is that I wanted to hear how I could further support my good friend Bocker
Oh shit! Caplocks! We better be careful 
Oh shit, I wrote in the groupme again. I'm double fucked 
Oh shit, Illinois is about to pull into #3 for total cases in the country.
Oh shit, spoilers!!!
Oh shit, that was supposed to be a text 
Oh shit, you’re probably fucked 
Oh shit, you're right 
Oh shit. Double jinx 
Oh shit. Sorry. Ignore that 
Oh shitttttt
Oh shizz
Oh shoot you're right. We talked about your suite members exposing their genitals to people
Oh so it's ok to collude to hurt Marcus but it's not ok to collude and not remind John to start Tyler lockett? 
Oh so she’s used to that 
Oh sorry I didn't see it. My bad
Oh sorry. Didn't see 
Oh sure, Jordan can talk about floppy wieners in a tv show but if I mention it, Becker tells me I'm not funny. #doublestandard
Oh sure, of course John only wants to hike in the whites 
Oh sweet 
Oh tell me more
Oh that makes sense 
Oh that was still cooper rush 
Oh that's a good guess 
Oh that's a good one too. I feel so conflicted 
Oh that's a spicy dance gif
Oh that's probably it
Oh that's tonight? I can't come
Oh that's tricky
Oh then by all means
Oh then i guess you do 
Oh then it looks like I'm free 
Oh third thought, don't like that RB from bama cutting into my Sony Michel value 
Oh true I completely forgot about hat 
Oh true, I forgot. It's really hard to remember those details when he only cares enough to tell you about them after he gets called out in the other groupme for not sharing them 
Oh true. My bad.
Oh true. Your tv is probably ahead of my feed so the pick didn't happen on my end until well after you said +3
Oh wait
Oh wait
Oh wait 
Oh wait 
Oh wait 
Oh wait 
Oh wait 
Oh wait 
Oh wait I played a bunch of firefight matches, probably closer to 200
Oh wait, he definitely at least used to live in Melrose. I think he have a plaque for him or something 
Oh wait, he doesn’t have a sub-4 hour finish. 
Oh wait, no it was just you and Emyr. The other 3some was the other group of randos 
Oh wait. Nevermind 
Oh wait. Standby 
Oh wait. They just added a lightning bolt to the dodgers logo 
Oh wait...
Oh wait....
Oh wait......

Oh wait....they lost and aren't in a playoff spot 
Oh we are still doing this dimple ball thing?
Oh we finally got to 32? Better at BB🐐 to the list to piss chan off 
Oh we had a secret Santa with everyone but you. That was my gift for him 
Oh well now that you ask, Bocker....
Oh well that's a different story
Oh well. Back to the stream. Looks a little better 
Oh well. Sorry becks 
Oh what a catch. 
Oh wow 
Oh wow that kick was awful 
Oh wow. Way off 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah I am not disagreeing with that. In this day in age, I don't think denying a platform really does anything because people can just buy their own platform anyway.
Oh yeah I did see that lol 
Oh yeah I know. It was more of a joke since we don't have a grand prize 
Oh yeah you're right. Sorry for the egregious typo  
Oh yeah, I’ll take a big L on that last name. I knew it was Crews and still fucked it up 
Oh yeah. "Giants are peaking right at the end of the season just like when they won the Super Bowl" my ass. 
Oh yes, definitely saw the news about a town in southern Mexico and their grocery store policies
Oh yes, the ideal reaction would have been to be pissed off or mope around because of how sad I am at the missed opportunity. My mistake 
Oh yes. Agreed. 👍
Oh yes. That is true. I remember now 
Oh you haven't seen the social media posts? 
Oh you mean this handsome guy? 
Oh, @ASMB📵, guess what? My exam this week includes a lecture on the integration of metabolism. Guess who is studying carbohydrate metabolism again!!!!
Oh, and the base path/moat would be traversed by hitters with a jet ski
Oh, and we have an open bar tonight 
Oh, did you think you were invited, goody? 
Oh, forgot about Stafford because he died. Throw Stafford on that list
Oh, forgot to mention, all of the stops had lures on them 
Oh, forgot to respond to the mount Washington thing. I'll be at a wedding. Can't come, although I would love to 
Oh, hi Becker? Where have you been? Seems like you kind of disappeared after last nights game. 
Oh, I forgot the diced tomatoes 
Oh, I guess you wouldn't. My bad. 
Oh, I had Chinese food last night. I appropriated the shit out of your culture 
Oh, I know what Bocker is referring to. I walked past a lady of the night wearing only a lace lingerie body suit on my way to school today. That’s like the third time in my life I’ve ever seen a pair of boobies 
Oh, I thought you listened to around the NFL too :(
Oh, I was referring to her boyfriend. That's an L on my part. I thought you were literally referring to her fuckboi
Oh, if it was from that GroupMe, then I am happy that I wasn't invited
Oh, Lamar miller feels like it's week 30 because his body hurts so badly? Maybe that's why you don't give him 50 carries a game for the first half of the season 
Oh, league invoked attorney/client privilege with the documents and notes taken by wells. They didn't have any access to what he submitted to the commissioner. Which if it was a truly fair and independent investigation, the files should have been released to both sides 
Oh, let me correct myself. It was probably the fells reservation 
Oh, maybe then you can probably see it when someone directs a message at you? 
Oh, nevermind. Cool
Oh, nvm
Oh, ok then. Carry on. 
Oh, Ross Stores counts as a real job? 
Oh, rumor has it. Kengaskhan can only be found in Australia, Farfetched in Asia, and Mr. Mine in Eastern Europe. Only way for us to get them is through eggs
Oh, so Lexi wants DIFFERENT jacket cuts, but not DIFFERENT stripe colors. Sure seems like it's still separate =/= equal. Boom. Lawyered. 
Oh, thanks goody. I appreciate your help translating since Joe has trouble articulating his thoughts after the "accident" 
Oh, then no
Oh, to be clear, I am still not hanging out with you
Oh, we’re still doing this shooty hoops thing?
Oh, yeah. Agreed. 
Oh, you were gone? 
Oh, you're not going to be in the state this weekend? That's too bad 
Oh. Add Marco Rubio to that list 
Oh. didn't work on my PC
Oh. Forgot to re-ignite that conversation.
Oh. Fuck you then. 
Oh. I don't think so 
Oh. I lied. Stephen Wu. Fuck that kid.
Oh. I must have looked up the wrong Shannon Stocks?
Oh. I spelled it wrong lol 
Oh. I take back the accusation 
Oh. I think whoever 
Oh. Ignore the last statement 
Oh. I'm a fucking idiot 
Oh. It looks like they're bad again 
Oh. Krug is still on the team 
Oh. My. God.
Oh. Nevermind 
Oh. Nevermind. I stupid 
Oh. New most hated Patriot. Reggie Wayne. Didn't even make it to the season, but somehow I still hate him with a passion.
Oh. That should be directed at Jamie too 
Oh. That’s very different than win expectancy. I thought you were asking what the differential of wins was between actual and preseason prediction 
Oh. The Aguayo/Folk sound drops were gold
Oh. Then fuck you 
Oh. Then I grind HARD at night 
Oh. We can just resign? I resign then unless I win the league this year 
Oh...
Oh...
Ohh boda Borg 
Ohh gotcha
Ohh gotcha. That makes sense 
Ohh my bad. 
Ohh thank you for reminding me@JustFacts✅ 
Ohh whats the scoop? 
Ohhh going for the slow con. I love it 
Ohhh gotcha. What about Marcus, then?
Ohhhh Lauren Anderson and Sam Doro. Why didn't you just say so 
Ohhhh tell me more
Ohhhhhhh Becker

Ohio State, Texas, Penn State, and ND/Georgia. What a unique final four. Definitely no blue bloods there 
Ohio, Illinois, and California preceded Mass

Ok cool cool. I just asked Olivia if that was too much. I was worried 
Ok cool. My IRA is still tied with MGH which restricts the funds in which its employees can invest so I gutta see if I can get out of those constraints. The SP500 is not currently an option I have
Ok cool. So we pay the same amount. I was going to be pissed if you paid less and got TV
Ok good point, maybe not @Beaner but probably the other PhDs
Ok got to level 5. Joined the blue team. I didn't read the significance of the different teams. Can someone fill me in?
Ok great. Discussion over 
Ok guys, I know I shouldn't care, but I'm getting seriously concerned for beckers well being (but not concerned enough to actually text or call him to check if he's ok)
Ok guys, I think we've had enough basketball talk in August. Let's switch to a real sport like football. 
Ok he's right, I need him 
Ok I don't know who it is. I give up 
Ok I won’t
Ok I'll just keep winning then 
Ok jordan and joe, I guess you can feel a little better. 
Ok let's not go that far Bocker. The man is a god.
Ok like I said, we need a reservation and if we wait too long, we're going to lose that slot. So I need a total definitive count before I sign us up. Also, everyone has to sign a waiver online. Also also, just to repaint a picture, it's less of an escape the room and more of solving challenges to make it through many different quests. It involves rooms, but you aren't confined in a room until you escape 
Ok Marcus 
Ok maybe
Ok maybe it's a little different 
Ok my expansion and original sets are mixed in together so will just bring the whole thing 
Ok Ryan, you win. I'll give Becker AP for Eli back 
Ok so not the knee. Good
Ok so plan is to meet around 7. Bocker, is there a bar or place you recommend? We can grab drinks, do some gambling, Darrow can fuck some bitches
Ok so that was not a putt that most people make 
Ok that’s what I thought. Just clarifying 
Ok that's fine. There's still time 
Ok that's just excessively rude right there 
Ok then 
Ok then 
Ok too much serious talk. Fuck all of you and your mothers. Lose my number 
Ok, Brett Kavanaugh
Ok, I guess I'll go fuck myself.
Ok, if that's what you'd prefer. Go fuck yourself. 
Ok, I'll let him know that his career was useless
Ok, let's go back to bashing Joe and challenging each other to sword fights 
Ok, so I'm rooting for Diaz
Ok, so you know the mechanism for hypertension, but not necessarily for anxiety because you didn't need to do studies on it. That's my point
Ok. 
Ok. 
Ok. Cuz I got confused because I thought I was supposed to keep winning
Ok. I don't have any insulin though. You should go steal me some and see how it goes 
Ok. I've heard all I need to hear now.
Ok. Now I’m off to bone saw some shit 
Ok. Storming the field is a little excessive 
Ok. Thanks. It's out of my system now. 
Ok. The first half of a Celtics playoff game is the only palatable part. I'm done watching 
Ok. We're having lean top round steak, broccoli and parmesan cheese, and braised brussel sprouts 
Ok. Who is next

Okay but at what point do we bring in Tee Higgins to be out #2 while paying him less than half of market rate? 
Okay but how much money is he giving me
Okay but maybe check the GroupMe more often. That's what being at work is for 
Okay can I get a detailed run down of every game to happen so far today? 
Okay go back to opening your whore mouth
Okay he deserves to be fired 
Okay I won’t talk basketball anymore
Okay I’m on team Elon now. This is sick 
Okay Joe/Morcus/your dad
Okay Joff
Okay KD
Okay maybe I'm willing to concede that maybe Cody parkey isn't good 
Okay that transition goal was fucking sick 
Okay then
Okay Tommy Carcetti
Okay we won't then
Okay 😔
Okay 😔
Okay*
Okay, fuck us I guess 
Okay, I am 90% sure that we rafted the pacuare river 
Okay, I won't post then 
Okay, maybe more like an hour
Okay, maybe the second QB taken then

Olivia and I used to go to PF Chang's not infrequently when we first started dating because it was one of the few restaurants that I knew of that did gluten free food. I hadn't had it in probably 8 or 9 years until last weekend when I got an order of Chang's spicy chicken in the DCA airport during my layover back from WV. It was awful 
Olivia and I were driving to Vermont and stopped at Chipotle on the day that everyone got sick...but we stopped at the one on route one in Saugus instead of that one in Cleveland circle like we usually would
Olivia chose to send it to the more reliable people
Olivia comes home and tells me about the patients on her unit who are dying. I am building a COVID curriculum for Tufts, and in public health classes discussing COVID daily. Maybe that makes me pessimistic but I would rather be overly cautious in all my estimates than overly positive
Olivia didn't get this reference. I have to feed her to a moose, right? 
Olivia doesn't say congrats but does say "wow that ring" 
Olivia gets upset that I never want to get Italian food when we go out to eat because I would rather make it at home and have it taste just as good, have leftovers, and save money

Olivia got that one right for us

Olivia is going to sit behind us and pretend to not be on our team

Olivia thinks he's a douche too 
Olivia told me at 10 pm on Wednesday that I was in charge of the turkey the next day. She then told me that I wasn't allowed to spatchcock it. I then asked to at least dry brine it since I didn't have a lot of time to make a liquid brine. I was told that "that would make it too salty." My creative juices are being stymied. I don't know how I can live like this for the rest of my life 
Olivia told me that I had to tip, that she always tips, that everyone she sees also always tips. I rolled down my window to give the $2 that I had in my car and the guy looked at me like I had 3 heads. 
Olivia told me the wrong answer for the Noah’s ark question. 
Olivia tried one and has decided that she will never eat one again 
Olivia used to have a Rav4, now have the 2022 Forester and it's much better than the new Ravs. I have a 2007 outback, so I am both a lesbian and poor 
Olivia was in the mid to high 600s and had to settle with that card. Got rejected at all the standard reward credit cards, including the one through her bank. She's now up almost 70 points in less than a year. It builds quickly

Olivia’s brother and law is a huge college football fan and has never heard of that 
Olivia’s cousins cannot confirm or deny that Microsoft is selling our groupme thread to Qatar for analysis.
Olivia’s cousins interned at Microsoft. I’ll ask them when we get to their house 
Olivia's car 
Olivia's cousin and his husband (who live in NJ) have been posting similar things for weeks. Their rhetoric was much more inflammatory, but they also invited all of their friends over because their house was a "mask-free haven." They all got COVID.
Olivia's dad has been teaching me for years but he's really leading the charge here
Olivia's family also used to not be able to eat a steak with ANY red. I have slowly beaten that out of them 
Olivia's family got me this salad dressing bottle that has recipes for like 12 types of dressings
Olivia's family rescued him in May
Olivias going up against nomar? She's fucked. 
Olivias grandmother told me last night that she didn't like Brady because he fathered an illegitimate child. And she was 100% serious. I never knew people actually cared about that 
Olivia's grandmother told Olivia's aunt that it was inappropriate for me to call Olivia's mom Chris and not Mom, so I guess you can say that marriage is off to a great start 
Olivia's landlord (back at BC) didn't like her and her roommates because they complained about the physical state of the apartment all the time. He set them up on an autofill plan with an expensive oil company so they kept getting expensive deliveries when they still have plenty of oil left. Not saying that the same situation is happening to you, but I'd check with your landlord to see if this was was his doing and ask him why he chose a company more expensive than other options. Not sure what else you can do 
Olivia's little sister is oblivious to the lizard people in the Denver airport. I wish I was that naive 
Olivias little sister is obsessed with the deadpool comics. I've been hearing about him for years and still couldn't really explain what the movie is supposed to be about 
Olivia's mom had her fantasy draft  tonight.....
Olivia's mom just asked for this gif so she can send it to her family and friends 
Olivia's mother co-owns a sticker design company. They've been non-stop advertising stickers they sell that are meant to go over webcams and iPhone cameras on Facebook. Not a good look in my opinion but I guess it's their highest selling product 
Olivia's new car auto-turns the steering wheel to center the car in the lane. When you pass bikers, the car actively tries to turn the car back towards the biker 
Olivia's sister convinced her dad to go to a homeopath last month (without telling him that the provider was a homeopath) for his chronic low back pain. He was "prescribed" St. John's wort, which interacts with several drugs he was taking, and some remedy with arsenic in it 
Olivia's sister was an elementary school teacher in CT when Newtown happened, and they told her to her face that they thought it was fake. Not a fun thanksgiving 
Olivia's sister's account.

On a football related note, I feel like the packers and patriots have had pretty similar season trajectories. Started off well, lots of injuries on the offensive line and other offensive players, a generally non-effective run game, a quarterback who has gotten hit more times than OJ's wife, and receivers who can't get open or can't catch the ball
On a happier note

On psych, we had a patient who was suffering from severe mental decline and we weren't sure if it was due to his psychiatric illness or an early form of dementia. We gave him the MOCA weekly as we increased his medication to trend his cognitive ability. Within a couple months, his score had improved. On a hunch, however, we gave him a version of the MOCA that is no longer used (there is currently only one approved version) and he failed it miserably. He had somehow memorized all the answers to the MOCA without being able to even recognize his nurse or doctor.
On PTI last night, Mike Wilbon said that Rondo deserves a spot in the HoF. Discuss. 
On Saturday, I cared for two 75+ patients with Covid who only had fevers. That same day, I intubated a 50 something year old Covid patient and put a central line in a 40 something year old Covid patient. The latter two died. Guess who was vaccinated and who wasn't

My trivia question to you is this. Which two NFL teams (both still exist) were playing on MNF that night, and who ended up winning the game? "
On this day of thanks, we Fuckholes have much to be thankful for. We are thankful for groupme, for allowing us to repeatedly bash each other using gifs and memes. We are thankful for fantasy football for giving us a reason to hate each other. We are thankful for john's pitiful team for giving us confidence that we won't have to take the SATs. But today, let us remember what we are most thankful for 
On this episode of #GoodyLikesRap...
On Tuesday 
On Upper, there is a multicultural floor. This year, the women of color on the floor have been harassed, had stuff in the hallways vandalized, etc. From the BlackAtBC Twitter and The Heights, it seems like the students who have been involved denied that they were targeting the students because of their race and have basically not been punished, although many are calling it a hate crime. The president of UGBC apparent sent out an unapproved Tweet about the incidents from the UGBC account that people were mad about. I never actually saw what it said, it was never published anywhere that I could see it and it was deleted shortly after posting. He got impeached by UGBC but was not convicted.
On weei today, I listened to Bart Scott, who is now an analyst for cbs, say that he respects Big Ben because he is tough so when he tried to tackle Ben, he would move his helmet to the side to make sure he didn't injure Ben. He then went on to say if he was tackling tom Brady, he would leave his helmet in their to try and break a few ribs.

Once the pandemic hit, I started realizing just how much I rely on big businesses because of their convenience, and because they can often offer some better deals. Like I have been looking at Home Depot for some stuff for a DIY project. Just for kicks, I started looking at more local hardware stores and they are all either run by ACE or TruValue. And NONE of them have websites

Our hospital has been battered by respiratory viruses. We had 80 people in our waiting room last night and almost 200 people in the department and probably 40% were respiratory virus related. Lots of staff call outs. At the beginning of the week, the hospital reinstituted a mask policy. I thought the problem was going to be getting staff to wear them again but jfc, you'd think you were killing a first born child the way some patients (specifically the ones hacking up a lung) reacted to being asked to wear a mask again 
Our hospital system lost 2% of it's workforce due to the vaccine mandate. We had a large number of staff quit or go per diem before the mandate was even announced, and even more staff leave since then 
Our landlord said that she was displaying very homophobic views during the conversation
Our last landlord had us pay independently...

Our offense looks like a Patricia-led office 
Our offense sucks. And our special teams suck. 
Our offer has been accepted 
Our OL is trash

Our percent positive rate and average cases per day have been rising. Which is expected with things being open but a lot of it has theoretically been driven by increases in tourism and MA residents being shitty and not adhering to the rules. So we may go backwards a bit
Our Planet is fucking depressing. Episode 2 is just sad 
Our program needs to get more scumbaggy. Let people get ripped before the game. Recruit more athletes and fewer student athletes. Stop being so Jesuit. "Family friendly" ruins the game for the rest of us

Our realtor did do a walkthrough of our house and we brainstormed all the things we could do to increase the value, tho 
Our run defense is poo poo
Our school has an agreement with Wild Rover to allow us to have 2 hours of an open bar pretty much whenever we want. Since everyone realized how much they hate Wild Rover, the social chairs have started hosting events at other bars and now people are batshit because they actually have to fucking pay for a drink. Can you believe that?
Our school’s cafe has a symbol on their menus that’s supposed to denote a gluten free option. It’s never been used because nothing is gluten free 
Our sickle cell team removed Benadryl from all of our treatment algorithms, probably for that reason 
Our student section at the hockey game sucks 
Our team answered it correctly. It was a team effort. That's all I have to say on the matter. 
Our team is good 
Our team is good 
Our top six corners are returning next year
Our track was shorter than regulation. You had to run further than a lap to run 400 meters. And there was no surface on it, it was literally concrete. They dug up the whole area to replace the football field and a new track wouldn't fit in the space so they built the new track literally all the way across town 
Our understanding was that he was originally planning to hold onto the apartment for a lot longer. He and his brother co-own it. The story we got was that his brother was looking to buy a house and wanted his part of the investment back to buy his own property.

Pain on the bottom of your foot can be from a few things: improperly fit shoes, plantar fasciitis, muscle strain, etc. Do the usual RICE stuff. You can freeze a plastic water bottle and roll it with your foot. If it continues, might want to pop into a running store and have them see if your shoes are the right fit for you, or if you would benefit from inserts

People (me and Chan, pretty sure John just left because he doesn't find football enjoyable) leave because the league has a dumb set of rules that have become increasingly convoluted over the years, and they find the league not fun. People don't come back because of the annual tradition of downplaying how unfun the league is and refusal to convert to a more traditional set of rules that increases parity between all managers. And before Marcus says that parity doesn't exist, it is a fantasy league that is supposed to be fun. If we all have an equal shot each year, everyone is going to be more likely to be invested throughout the season.
People accuse the Pats of doing it because of Brady's TB12 business 
People also get their dogs married to other dogs, which is fucked. 
People are comparing the flak that David Price is getting to the shit that Lackey got when he was in Boston? Are people dumb? 
People are just complaining because defenses have an edge for once, and the product looks worse when offenses suck
People are mad about it because it's singling out one minority group and saying they can't enjoy the same rights as other citizens. The size of the group affected doesn't matter, it's ignoring civil liberties for political points 
People are mad that the Jaguars got called for 6 penalties for 98 yards and the Pats got called for 1 special teams holding call 
People are really bad at getting on and off planes 
People aren't afraid of us. We're just like everyone else 
People at bc are complaining 
People can change
People died so you could have a choice between a douche and turd sandwich. Pick one. 
People don't go to retail stores, Anthony. Don't you know that millennials killed brick and mortar businesses 
People don't talk about how Kareem hunt fumbled on his first nfl carry 
People don't want to watch a game that is so slow paced. Just like soccer. You could leave for half the game and literally have missed nothing. At least for me, I feel like football is exciting because every play, something happens that is important to the game 
People either didn't know how to stop on the scooter and so they would almost hit you on the sidewalk, or they would just roll out into traffic. 
People forget that a few years before spyware the Dolphins bought a tape of opponents play calls and calls at the line of scrimmage and got nothing in terms of penalties 
People forget that Davonte Adams used to be ass during his first season with responsibility 
People forget that Dumb and Dumber is about Rhode Island 
People forget that Goody founded the cabal when he walked around campus with a pro life ribbon on his backpack
People forget that Joe housed a tasting menu in DC 
People forget that they said that I lost the Alshon/Aaron Jones trade 
People forget that they weren't the first defense taken in our draft
People forget that when I win this week and Joe and Emyr tie, I pick my playoff matchup
People forget when I tied Bocker in golf on the Jersey shore 
People from revere couldn't even afford to go to the movie theater. They stayed outside in the flea market stabbing people
People go mad for anything from Apple on which they can waste money
People gutta learn to score slower. Smh 
People hate Saban, but I don't think anyone questions how good he is 
People have bought into Trump's narrative just like people bought into Obama's "change" narrative. Whether or not you buy into a politician's narrative is probably based on life experiences and environmental upbringing, not a based on your intelligence 
People I trust to evaluate quarterbacks: @Herky the (Women’s Basketball) Hawkeye 
People in jersey are very passionate about which name they call it
People in Olivia's extended family believe that the moon landing wasn't real, that Sandy Hook was made up so the government can restrict guns, and that the government created Lyme disease in Lyme, CT as a biological weapon but screwed up and accidentally released it into the wild. Thanksgivings with them are interesting...
People just need to stop shooting police officers, and police officers need to stop shooting unarmed civilians, regardless of race. Simple answer. There, I fixed America 
People leaving the Pats game right now should be shot 
People like Bocker who still religiously watch ESPN 
People mad
People making $50m/year just care more 
People need to stop getting hurt. Too many timeouts 
People on Twitter are pretty high on him 
People really need to talk more about how good a blocker Gronk is 
People use people first language, Anthony. Your words are offensive
People were pointing out how he went out of the way on the Manningcast to praise the cowboys organization multiple times

Personalitities*
Personally, I hate giving out awards to the losing team. And absolutely hate interviewing the losing goalie and saying "obviously not the outcome you guys wanted but you're leaving with some hardware. How does it feel?"
Personally, I think it's a good idea to have a group that hands then out, and in an ideal world, the school would support that. But I made the choice to come to a catholic college. Obviously, like with every single other religious school, my beliefs aren't going to line up perfectly. But at least I understand that it was my decision to come here and pay tuition to an establishment of Catholic faith 
Personally, it hurt me the most to see you being victimized in such a horrible way 
Personally, I've never met someone who has ever gotten offended at someone for pointing out flaws in Islamic religion and culture. I do hear people go all SJW when others claim that Islam is a violent religion because that's only certain sects of Islam and isn't representative of the religion as most people practice it. 
Personally, not something for me. I could do without them on a girl, but won't judge her any differently if she has one. Unless it was something fucking stupid
Personally, spoilers in the GroupMe don't matter to me unless you don't want me to tell SPOILERS 
Personally, there is zero chance that I don't die in an NFL game 
Perspective on the Gronk trade compensation. Patriots had literally zero leverage. He can say "either trade me or I am staying retired." The Buccs knew that. Patriots are lucky to get a 4th.

Please take that back, Morcus. Bocker has done nothing to find himself self to the gulag. Well besides leaving plates out for the cleaning staff. And sending us to a party at mit that didn't exist. And messaging Joe before freshman year. And throwing a party that almost caused the floor to collapse. And making us change all of our scheduled GroupMe event times and locations at the last minute. And nuthugging Nate Silver. And making his own coldstone without gaining any weight during quarantine while I ballooned up. And never finishing a race he signed up for.

Plus @Skimmer never stole my cereal 
Plus as an informed mma fan and hockey enthusiast, hockey players fight out of their height and weight class all the time. MMA should abolish the class system and just have everyone fight everyone. /s
Plus Becker paid me back for it, so I guess it's more of his problem 
Plus by rule, anyone I leave on the bench does well. So as a pats fan, you should be thanking me

Plus he looks mildly Middle Eastern so he would be perfect 
Plus he spent half of the offseason in jail 
Plus he violates the quarantine by going on Tinder dates
Plus heating the building and trash/recycling removal
Plus he's darrowball's favorite quarterback. Two very good reasons right there 
Plus he's flying delta again. Even if he's in first class, he's still a plebeian 
Plus he's got this guy 
Plus he's obviously skimming 
Plus I basically lived at Olivia's senior year and she was in Newton
Plus I didn't think of using spot hero 
Plus I got voted most likely to live in Melrose forever in my high school year book so I can't move back. Have to prove the haters wrong 
Plus I hate avocado ice cream. Could never be Thomas Brady 
Plus I never got the invite to fantasy football this year so the name is inaccurate
Plus I said that I based my opinion on no personal experience. I can't be held liable if my opinions aren't factual. 
Plus I technically committed to maintaining my emt cert for Hazmat 
Plus if I devalue other players in the league, the value of my players goes up 
Plus if you remember anything, his parents moved out of jersey 
Plus if you're a chick, how do you not fuck nelly?

Plus imagine having to coach against BC when you could get two easy wins a year against the Chiefs 
Plus is it fair to say that we shouldn't pursue sustainable energy alternatives just because china isn't? 
Plus isn't it boring to watch Nick Saban win every year?
Plus it’s beneficial for financial institutions because there is a finite amount of bitcoins available, so you can’t just fraudulently produce more 
Plus Jerry jones literally would sell his soul and probably murder someone to win a super bowl 
Plus jj watt sucks 
Plus John should know that the Fuckholes have a collective attention span of 47.9 seconds on average. He was taking too long to state the right answer 
Plus la la land is filled with attractive white people. Instant academy favorite

Plus St Patrick's day propagates rape culture with all the "kiss me I'm irish" sayings. /s
Plus that throw to Pearsall to the pylon 
Plus the front desk staff had "forgotten" to swipe me in several times so I normally get more than 10 visits anyway 
Plus the next coaching phenom 
Plus the top bracket is definitely having most of their money deposited directly into offshore accounts so I assume they don't pay any taxes anyway 
Plus their dog is awesome
Plus there is a good burrito named after him 
Plus they change challenges every few months so presumably some of the ones I did are gone now 
Plus they do gf donuts, so their obviously the best 
Plus they only ran two screen passes
Plus they’ve had such a shitty clubhouse in terms of leadership this year. Not all on Farrell obviously but I don’t think he inspires players to take leadership roles in the team 
Plus think of all the white women in jean shorts and crop tops Darrow would inseminate
Plus we all know goody goes lefty and righty. Not monogamous at all 
Plus we have to present to the PEM fellow who has less EM experience than we do (no offense) and it makes the ED so damn inefficient. There are times when I've wanted to discharge a patient for like 3 hours but the fellow has not seen and staffed the patient with the attending so I can't discharge them
Plus we suck 
Plus who wouldn’t want to pay out the ass to watch someone like Case Keenum sling the pigskin in the big game 
Plus Will Fuller left the game. Texans basically have no chance to win 
Plus you do lots of fun things with your friends like fantasy football 
Plus you got stuck in Valhalla, NY
Plus you'd be closer to @The Awbarn Bandwagoner 
Plus you're vaguely Mediterranean or middle Eastern or Mexican 
Plus, can you rule against Kessler. If you put wheels on his grandmother, she'd be a trolley car 
Plus, in many rural areas, the marketplaces are only serviced by one or two insurers, which reduces marketplace competition and has raised premiums. And without guarantee of future payments from the government, some insurers have (or at least have threatened to) remove themselves from the marketplaces

Quick remark towards Jordan's point. I don't think the SATs offer exams during the summer and there are very few options after the fantasy season ends. I think they start back up in September. As someone who was in this situation last year, I think as long as you're registered for a test day before the draft (even if the test say is a few weeks after), that should be ok.

Rapaport is saying that Browns are considering just cutting Brock now 
Rapaport is the clear #1 for NFL in my opinion. I don't know who Woj is. ESPN's baseball pundits seem better than all other sports IMO 
Rapaport often has stories from sources around the league before Schefter. If you don't follow him on Twitter, you'd never know because ESPN normally never cites him. Schefter will get the same news from similar sources, just not necessarily first 
Rapaport says Luke is getting evaluated for a concussion, not a leg injury. Twitter doc said maybe acl or maybe chest. But I'm very confused 
Rapaport suggested that since the announcement was made after the transaction wire closed for the day, they could be leaking the info in hopes that a team may trade for him before tomorrow

read: I'm not going to do it if I come in last
Reading a little insight on the Pats TD drive. As Romo was pointing out, the Pats ran the same play three times in a row. They used a 22 personnel formation and then spread 5 receivers out wide. On the first play, Edelman lined up closer inside and ended up being covered by a LB while Develin spread out wide and drew a CB. He caught sat down in the middle of the field and got past the LB for 13 yards. Great use of a mismatch from McDaniels
Reading now that it’s Shelton + Browns 2018 5th for Pats 2019 3rd 
Reading that it was Marshall's request 
Reading the dolphins subreddit, seems like a throw over the middle and the receiver got lit up, was very unconscious. Makes sense why he was de-shirted to hook him up to the EMS monitor

Real tl;dr for the article I posted: according to most accounts (the exception being the government-operated park police), there was a crowd of peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday afternoon, including children and church clergy members. Trump allegedly had the police tear gas them out of the way so he could walk up to the church, take the pictures with the bible, and walk away. The bishop in Washington that oversees that church tore Trump a new one for using the church and bible as a prop.

Remember when Chicago didn't know that Alshon Jeffrey existed 
Remember when Edelman was banged up, gronk was out, Sony Michel was hurt, Shaq Mason was inactive, cannon was coming back from a head injury, our best received had barely learned the offense, our only active tight end can't catch, our leading rusher is a special teams player, our Dline can't get pressure, and our linebackers are slower than a sack of potatoes rolling uphill in a blizzard and we still put up 31 while holding Aaron Rodgers to 17? 
Remember when everyone was pissed that we didn't give him 36 mil guaranteed? 
Remember when Goody predicted that Congress would stop Trump from being a dumb dumb when he got elected?

Remember when LeBron ruined Space Jam and then got swept in the playoffs? What a legacy

Remember when the Panthers were 3-0 and everyone thought Sam Darnold was a good QB?
Remember when the Pats players were absolutely pissed that Kraft and BB let Easterby walk to the Texans
Remember when the pats swindled the jets in the 08 draft and convinced them to take Vernon gholston? Well apparently they told Revis they were out of the bidding on Monday, but no one told the jets that. So the jets kept raising the price thinking they were betting against the patriots
Remember when the Raiders were "legit"
Remember when the Raiders were legit because they almost beat the Chiefs again? 
Remember when the Red Sox gave away arguably the best player in the MLB 
Remember when the Red Sox predicted a pandemic and traded away their best player for just one season that wouldn't happen anyway so they could resign him as a free agent

Right after Panama 
Right after the Beatdown in Beantown 
Right because giving up 3 runs in the first inning and having to pull your starter in the first three innings again gives you great confidence that you're going to win two more games
Right because he falls miles short of Thomas Brady 
Right because I don't watch videos in the GroupMe 
Right because that's exactly how it was described 
Right because the person who hates basketball should be expected to get all of them since he's the only one guessing 
Right bocker. Sports should be like soccer when you can just buy players from other teams 
Right Goody, like for players like JC Jackson
Right groupme 
Right guard lined up in the neutral zone 
Right in the middle of my first exam. You know I'll be there. 
Right Marcus?
Right near Chelsea. Just have to drive through all of Everett 
Right next to my wine cellar and behind my panic room 
Right now I only see posts of them on reddit or Facebook posts from distant high school acquaintances, for whom I have little emotional connection with their soon-to-be infant child. 
Right now you can leave your apartment. You can go on walks, pick up food from restaurants, etc.  
Right now your insurance company decides how much they spend on you based on your premium and deductibles. It's the cost of the actual care that you are provided that is inflating 
Right now, Marcus's attempt to "fix" the OT rules reminds me of Goody's arbitrary attempts to "fix" the fantasy league rules
Right now, you're in your third grade classroom. You can still go to the bathroom with a pass, but you can't go to gym class if you're supposed to be in science class. If there is a gunman in the school, you aren't even getting a pass to the bathroom

Right to protection from unlawful search and seizure

Right up there with Times Square 
Right, because darrow is. 
Right, because dealing with a deficient immune system, scurvy, and excess free radicals are a good alternative to fruit consumption 
Right, because we’d all LOVE to talk constitutional rights and politics with Marcus 
Right, because you guys are so poor that my league dues constitute a charitable donation
Right, because you've never been super sloshed before
Right, for your initial approval. Once a drug is approved and on the market, you don't need to go through a phase III trial to prescribe the drug off label
Right, I'll just go back to enjoying losing to every team not named Richmond
Right, incredibly active 
Right, it makes your googling easier'
Right, just like that popular children's book: The Woman Who Cried Sexual Assault Outside Lower on a Saturday Night at 1 AM.
Right, so how much did you have to pay
Right, so the best team should win. Seems easy enough
Right, that's why the SlimFast CEO is there
Right, that's why they needed a competent QB
Right, which is why I said that I believed they meant top rope when they referred to a "climbing wall" because they took the time to mention bouldering separately
Right, who wants a school filled with 10,000 Joe Bourques
Right, you said parents. Plural 
Right. He has six rings. He only has one 1,000 yards rushing. Obviously that's more special 
Right. I buy a specific one that is low in sugar, high in protein and fiber for that reason.
Right. Just another team that won't compete with Alabama and Clemson this year with that bad loss
Right. Let me put it in the mail 
Right. Mac Jones and Tom Brady are 1 and 2
Right. Republicans don't believe in social benefit handouts
Right. So tell us. 
Right. So the pick is worth less because there is less of a chance the Cavs get the 1st overall is the Nets come in last 
Right. Thanks why @Ryan Darrow and I are doing it 
Right. That’s why I said at least the sentence was articulate 
Right. That's why we are only cancelling mine
Right. They'll shoot 25% on 69 3s next game
Right. We know that because we have studied that. We haven't studied this.

Run I remember Becker is going to be at the game tomorrow 
Run upfield, not backwards
Run warm up, chest and shoulders 
Run, run, throw deep to the best corner. Great sequence
Running back 
Running backs are expected to hold onto the ball. I don't know the statistics, but I would assume a good running back fumbles on less than 10% of their carries. Fumbling costs their team an opportunity to gain 7 points. They are penalized by losing 2 points in fantasy 
Running feels better than sex
Running four miles continuously is further than I ever trained for it. You're in better shape than I was

Saw that
Saw that last night. Still don’t know how you don’t put him in if he can help your defense later in the game. No other coach would do that, but I guess that’s a decision you can make when you’re afforded the job safety that Bill had 
Saw the replay. I can understand the anger but you're not going to get a goal call when you go barreling through the crease on a breakaway.  
Saw this live. Sent the gif to Olivia. She wasn't amused

Secondly, I was expecting Ryan to continue to hold tannehill, despite me asking to drop him. He ignored my request earlier, why would I think he would actually drop him if I asked again?
Secondly, Olivia's mom knows the owner. The owner's wife has celiac. He apparently makes, but doesn't advertise, the beer as gluten removed. Unlike hard alcohol which has a distillation process, beer made with gluten containing grains does not normally get the gluten removed. Some companies will "remove" the gluten and claim it gluten free, but all of the Celiac societies agree that the process is super sketch and not safe

Shaved coconut tastes like grass, rolled in diarrhea, mixed with pube clippings, and and boiled in sugar that has been sitting in a warehouse inhabited by 17 species of rodents 
Shaw should be at first. Holt should be at third. Rusney should be in left. And Sandoval and Ramirez should be unemployed. 
She 100% wants to bang you 
She also bought a condo with full knowledge that her bedroom was directly next to not one, but two driveways and our nextdoor neighbors make far more noise with their cars than we do 
She also has to not bet their entire savings on the outcome of a BC season to make sure they don't go broke
She also played basketball there. Got kicked off the team the week before graduation (so essentially nothing happened except she had to turn in all of the apparel they gave her) for getting blackout, breaking into a catered function on campus, and attempting to steal all of the alcohol from said function. Goody and her would get along 
She apparently invested in bitcoin years ago and hasn’t checked her wallet yet 
She broke her own world record by 2 seconds. Her old world record was still 3 seconds faster than the second place person in her event 
She broke up with me between freshman and sophomore year. Are you even my friend?
She can never go back to a simpler time when things made sense 
She could tell me whatever lie she wants if I get access to the Burton fortune 
She did post on social media 
She didn't put her hand over her heart during the anthem ceremony and her hair looked messy and she looked depressed when she wasn't competing in the individual all around 
She didn't. She was cleaning up the sides and then all of a sudden did a full pass across the top of my head 
She doesn’t not like me (to my knowledge), just doesn’t like me enough to invite me 
She doesn't do it for me 
She doesn't know you exist and she doesn't care 
She doesn't work in my EDs. Can't do anything for you unfortunately
She dumped the richest man in the world. No one accused her of being smart 
She ended the train ride by encouraging one of her children to hit the other child for not sharing her phone. I understand why goody wants to rip welfare away from people now 
She feels sorry for herself too 
She goes to PA school there 
She got hired through one of her clinicals there
She got tortured into giving umbridge info about DA, unless the movie is different from the book, which I haven't read since it came out
She had mentioned one in the south end that I had never been to 
She has a chronic pain thing 
She has a terrible memory, zero chance she knows where all of the hiding spots are still 
She has crohns 
She has lost her hair-cutting job. I will only trust professionals from now on.
She has Ricky. You deserve the bed 
She hot?
She hot? -Jordan 
She included linea from Hamilton because she is a big Hamilton fan, according to ABC 
She is correct
She is literally doing this just to make everyone's lives horrible 
She is not and also gay and very happy with her wonderful partner 
She is not my queen
She is pretty hot 
She is saying that she is no longer going to object 
She is very committed to Megan 
She is. Goody is an idiot 
She just hates me
She just Steve Bartman'ed the Tour
She knew that you had another ski weekend planned so she didn't want to cause a rift in your relationship with your other friends. She didn't want to invite anyone else in here
She knows 
She likes dogs. This is a good start
She lives near the world famous Max Burger 
She lives right outside of Davis square in Somerville. 30 second walk from the red line, and street parking is free on Sunday's 
She looks like a nice lady
She makes Bocker look like employee of the year 
She may stop having sex with Jordan when she finds out how good running feels 
She might have just jumped La Syd in the power rankings 
She might not have a microscope handy 
She must be a masochist 
She must have just seen the Michael Jackson musical
She only has 3 more shifts before she starts studying for her board exam. She'll have all the time in the world!
She plays 45 songs, 3 nights in a row, every week. 3 hours of singing. I have never been to a stadium show but it seems like she is truly in a league of her own 
She probably blew the previous record away 
She probably knows me better as Joff
She probably won’t win but I appreciate your support 
She realizes I went to every tailgate the two years after graduation, right 
She saw Darrow on Sunday 
She seemed like a keeper 
She should consider not being a vegan if she wants to run that much and still maintain adequate levels of essential amino acids. You should tell her that 
She should go to a respected stock broker, tell him she dug up the money in her back yard, and invest it to create a diverse portfolio that continues to grow over time
She should have absolutely lost her license. I don't think she should have been jailed. I'm walking into a labor and delivery shift but will hopefully have plenty of downtime to discuss more 
She should have taken quaaludes. Saw it in a movie once. 
She should have used an oxford comma
She should ice, take Advil as described on bottle. See doctor if she is incontinent, feels shooting pain down her legs, or pain doesn't get better 
She should just keep playing and not let Usher continue 
She should paint flames on her shoes
She should quit
She single? 
She sings the Sunday night football opening 
She still spells her name wrong
She straight trippin, dawg
She they get engaged before or after he hired her to manage his money? 
She told me it was to save the penguins
She told me to worry about Ryan Darrow 
She tried to give me an OTPBHF (over the pants butthole finger) after giving Olivia an OTDBHF (over the dress butthole finger) 
She verbally accosted my landlord to demand that we take down our pride flag because the building bylaws don't allow for alteration of the outside architecture, and apparently a flag constitutes an alteration
She wants to create clinics for poor people comprised of APPs (NPs and PAs) and people who didn't match to residency 
She was also there because she lost vision in one eye 
She was an instructor for a number of years 
She was aphasic, hemiparetic, and had a left facial droop. Probably nothing right? 
She was crying mostly because she just got a divorce about a year ago and that was her first wedding since. But also because she was incredibly drunk and got rejected 
She was dating a Boston cop who was found dead in a snow back outside of another cop's house. People say she did it. Other people say that it was a cover up to protect the police officer whose house he was found outside of 
She was diagnosed with cancer after having major abdominal surgery in January, and is now undergoing chemo, for anyone not wanting to have to Google it themselves. 
She was in the tournament of stars, won the first round but I think lost in the finals? And then I think she was on for a redemption episode 
She was just a temporary consultant. Her position ended after preseason 
She was like at least 3 hosts ago and I don't even know if the show is still going on?
She was like live-tweeting the locations of congressmen during the coup attempt, too
She was making fun of you
She was my 420 partner when we went to 7 day a week coverage 
She was never drunkely offered me favors but she made it quite clear that she had romantic interests in me in high school. She confronted me about it during college and was pissed when I told her I just spent all of junior year avoiding her 
She was not your wife when you lived away from her
She was roommates with Priyanka 
She was texting people at her old job all day to get deets about him. Apparently it was widely known that he has had multiple affairs in several companies he’s been through 
She was too Christian 
She was v surprised af. Had no idea 
She was very rich...
SHE WASNT FUCKING INVITED SND SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN THERE 
She went to a shitty DO medical school and matched at a shitty DO residency in some random shitty hospital. She blocked me on all social media so everything I know is from the friend who introduced us 
She went to school with him during like elementary school 
She won her event by 5 full seconds. At one point during the race, the announcer commented that the girl in second place must be happy that she can still see Ledecjy's feet 
She won't know who it belongs to anyway
She would not refund the first sets of flights, which were the expensiver ones. She refunded a whole $38.80
She wouldn’t let me go visit her sister alone. 
She’s a cutie tho 
She’s a saint. 
She’s a vegan, to make matters worse. 
She’s crediting me for being awesome 
She’s not performing but she’s definitely still getting married at halftime
She’s real bad. 
She’s the new producer for the Around the NFL podcast. She sucks. She was prominently featured in the new episode that dropped today. She’s bad at her job. 
She’s too old for you
Shea McClellin lined up in the slot on that last offensive play and ran straight back into the backfield 
Shefty coming for the accountants 
Shelbie and Caroline literally flew out of the DMV when they heard that I was coming
Shelbie seems to take every opportunity to travel without him anyway. She just went to Colorado to visit@Artisanal Anal Artist 
Shelbie sent me a picture of her
Shelbie then argued about who would fund said education
Shelbie was not amused
Shelbie was pro doctors getting paid
Shelbie would make this GroupMe better but we would make Shelbie worse 
She'll be doing porn within two years. Book it. 
Sheltered in terms of thinking Papa Gino's is sketchy. I ate Dominos every Friday in elementary school.
Shenandoah was pretty. 
Sherm Allston officially gone, as goody predicted 
Sherman hurts his achilles yesterday. Forced to play on a short week. Tears it. Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth become lip readersx
Sherman is playing well
She's a doctor. You'd probably offend her with your stance on the medical profession 
She's a fucknut
She's a nursing assistant at MelWak
She's a resident in Boston now, and she was cute. Go get coffee and a bagel with her 
She's already mad at him for not knowing Ricky AND Frank's birthdays
She's asleep after the night shift last night but she'll be up to video me eating dinner
She's attractive, John. But other than her attitude, I don't really know much about her. She keeps a lot to herself 
She's Chan's wife. Skimmer
She's conveniently saying that she "hasn't heard that news yet." 
She's currently on IR with an acl tear. Not going to be playing this season 
She's dating Justin verlander. I think she's made decent life investments. 
She's from the south. That land is probably worth the equivalent of a toaster 
She's getting on a plane to California. Obviously doesn't want me
She's good at marketing herself. Glad we agree 
She's got a lot to learn about us 
She's here.
She's in denial about Marcus and his girth 
She's in that groupme. Or at least she was before I left
She's just so unlikeable
She's moving out. Don't compromise. Live your life. 
She's not in this GroupMe
She's not the only one 
She's obviously not infallible and her messaging definitely needs improvement but I agree with respecting her because of her passion to the causes in which she believes. I personally agree with a lot of the progressive agenda, which obviously biases my opinions of her, but I would prefer more democrats like her than the Nancy Pelosi/Chuck Schumer type.
She's old, man 
She's on The Path to be induced to doggy Mensa 
She's probably still trying to find your dick in the pictures 
She's sitting with Olivia and me at the honeymoon table 
She's taking an exam 
She's taking nausea meds around the clock and still throwing up so things are great
She's the only one who deserves the runway 
She's very fit, which John is all about 
She's welcome. Also, is she single 
Shh
Shh. He's back in the GroupMe now
Shhh
Shhhh
Shhhh Nick. Tax cuts. 
SHHHH WE ALL AGREED THAT ONLY PREDRAFT HYPE COUNTS. DONT GIVE HIM AN ANGLE 
Shift work is great
Shifting gears. Jeremy Lane had arm surgery immediately after he broke it in the super bowl. He says he woke up in the recovery room to see Seattle on the 1 yard line. 
Shifting topics. MLB is testing a new extra innings rule in the minor leagues this season: 10th inning starts with a runner on second...
Shipment was quite fun, still think Carentan was better
SHIT

Shit cocking fucking amazeballs
Shit I didn’t know anyone else still watched/listened to PTI 
Shit I forgot the MBA
Shit I haven’t made it through everything yet. I’ll take my L 
Shit I saw that today and meant to post about it. I guess it didn't happen until just now, since it wasn't in the GroupMe
Shit in the break room 
SHIT it was chicken thighs
Shit on the outside wall
Shit wait, I mean I can't cuz I have to work out tomorrow and infect the whole gym with MRSA
Shit wrong chat 
Shit wrong tag 
Shit you're right. I have the campaigns shifted one game. Replace mw1 with mw2, etc
Shit, Darrow I think you might have actually killed him
Shit, don't tell the Cabal 
Shit, Faiz has fathered an offspring?
Shit, I assumed that the doctor in my scenario was a man.
Shit, I quoted the wrong message 
Shit, I said her gender
Shit, I should label it gluten free 
Shit, is that creepy? 
Shit, it was an old Asian guy 
Shit, Joe agrees with me. I change my opinion. Great career move getting out of the same conference as BC 
Shit, Joe Burrow apparently hurt too 
Shit, spoiled it in the wrong GroupMe
Shit, that backfired. 
Shit, this is already on your list. I didn't look before I posted it
Shit, wait, #NotMyNarrative
Shit, wait. Hold on 
Shit. He just responded 
Shit. I had $20 on Bocker not matching outright
Shit. I mean niners players 
Shit. Meant to say that iOS is the best and green texts suck 
Shit. My wife is with a group of other females at a bachelorette party 
Shit. Nevermind. 
Shit. Report says that his dad went into cardiac arrest, and while doctors were working on him, his mother went into cardiac arrest. Holy fuck. 
Shit. We talked to Chan like 2 mo the ago 
Shit....
Shit....wait....it was Kirk's fault!!
Shitting*
Shitty teams reset the market for other shitty teams. Teams that are perennially good are always going to attract a few vets who want rings and willing to play for less. Middle of the pack teams suffer because they often don’t have the cap space and can’t promise guys rings 
Shnikey?
Shocker. The guy galavanting around Europe catches Covid 
Shohei is a lil bitch
Shoot, I mentally meant to tag the biggest Mo Vaughn fan,@Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD , but for some reason tagged @The Big Dick Bandit 
Shoot, I went to Breworks Zoo
Shoot, I would bet all my money on it but I just gave it all away to a Nigerian prince looking to move to America to start a new life for his family 
Shoot. Sorry, I used acronyms. I'm what's wrong with society
Shooting at elementary school in San Bernardino
Shooty hoops and dimbleball. Yuck. Hopefully The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) comes in and saves us with updates on all the terrorists he's killed 
Shooty hoops doesn't wet my whistle
Shooty hoops isn't over yet?

Since Becker didn't have any Thompson points to begin with, I think that puts him in the negative. I can only assume that he will be executed now 
Since Bocker is unhelpful, Kristen's address is 429 Bunker Hill St
Since Goody didn't want to ask you
Since graduation 
Since he was never tried by jury, the initial "guilty" doesn't stand, so it was removed from his record 
Since I am an unbiased party to this argument, I will confirm that @The Big Dick Bandit is #JustFacts✅ and never is #JustFalse❌
Since I can't make it tomorrow, can we move the BBQ to a 6 am breakfast? Also it's more convenient for me to have it at my apartment
Since I caught my Lapras, I've pretty much stopped. I'll log in occasionally on the way to and from work but you can only encounter so many rattatas before you go crazy 
Since I don’t know the answer to that, I can only assume he’s taken up a life of blowing dudes in the alley behind his apartment for a hit of coke
Since I have not been on an MBTA train or bus in over a year, I have not had the opportunity to bitch about it. I am not here to officially announce that the Mass Vax website is my new MBTA. I will soon be bringing hard-hitting complaint content back to the GroupMe where it belongs.

Since we're now < a month away, and we said that we would revisit a month out, are we still planning on doing the ski trip in Stowe. Can I get a reminder of who is planning on coming (Nick I know you probably haven't figured out arrangements so don't worry about giving me a final answer)? Olivia's family has asked for an update

So Baker starts from now on right 
So basically an "in kind" service would be time provided that is not otherwise funded?
So basically Goody's opinion 
So basically he can utilize the military under the guise of quelling an insurrection? 
So BB went to the head official before the coin toss and told him that if the pats won, they wanted to kick the ball. Apparently they was communicated to the captains. Don't know why slater thought they were going to receive 
So because he's giving up on any chance to win the championship, he's publicly projecting his only goal is to win the MVP? 
So Becker wouldn't trade forsett and Edelman for McCoy and Floyd but will take lacy who is going to score -12 points against the pats this week 
So Becker, safe to say you've abandoned bills mafia and now on firmly on the starship enterprise?
So blank slate?
So Bocker, what do you want to do
So Bocker, you're saying he's #13/32. I would argue that he's pretty solidly in the middle of the pack by your definition
So Bradford is dead too. First Gronk, then Jordan, now Bradford. 
So can a player only go to waivers if they've been on your team for X amount of time? 24 hours?
So can this Groupme go back to being lit?

So Emyr is putting up sandwiches on the last two props. Book it.

So far have sent cover letters to Maine Med, UVM, NWH, Tufts 
So far HoC season 6 is dumb as hell
So far I only know of kovin, Darrow, and possibly a couple of Olivia's friends who are coming. 
So far so good. I'm currently writing my impassioned speech to Kristen for tonight where I will beg her to let Ricky be my new roommate 
So far the podcast seems to be refuting the theories that men make more because they work in higher paying fields 
So far, I have nothing but positive thoughts about Chase Young. I'll give him another chance to call for Tom Brady's head before I count the failure against him 
So far, just LinkedIn users and Joff
So far, season 1 of the silo has done a good job teasing along the story. I have lots of theories. 
So fast that the camera can't even focus on me
So fat, slow, weak, and overvalued 
So Fitzmagic is bad
So FOH
So for everyone 
So from eastern NY?
So from watching 5 minutes of this game, Eli can't throw. His line can't block. And his receivers can't catch or get open. 
So fuck you, stop being #JustFalse*RedX*
So Fuckholes, how do we fix the state of bc athletics? 
So fucking wrong 
So fucking wrong. 4 people have come by 
So Fultz is trash, right? 
So funny how people actually thought that Drew Lock was going to be a good player in the NFL
So Gillislee is back practicing 
So glad that Danny Ainge acquired all those pick assets. 
So great to have an accessible phone charger and free wi-fi on my flight that left 15 minutes early. Especially when Olivia and I don't have a 3rd person in our row 
So happy Sandoval decided to get in shape three years into his contract 
So happy that Derrick Rose is going to finish a season without a major injury. What's that? He tore his meniscus and is going to miss the end of the season? Oh, never mind.... 
So happy that my JetBlue flight got me to Austin more than 30 minutes early 
So happy that the 7-9 WFT defense got over hyped, only to completely shit the bed while next year's super bowl MVP balled out 
So hasselback was getting rehydrated/medicated all afternoon 
So have people decided what hotel they are staying at for Marcus's wedding
So he appealed to the league. Goodell acted as arbitrator and upheld the suspension. The NFL then filed in court preventively asking a federal judge to uphold the punishment (they knew the NFLPA would file to have a judge vacate the suspension) 
So he could pitch one inning before he retired and everyone could suck his dick
So he def dead? What's the update today
So he found the guy who was able to accomplish what he couldn't, so he gets a place in the hall. 
So he thought he was down and he was celebrating? 
So he was convicted by a judge only. Basically the equivalent of a grand jury determining whether there is enough evidence to try someone in court. He's legally entitled to a trial by jury after that. When the court date came, his ex girlfriend/accuser did not show up, so charges were dropped 
So he's like Whitebread?
So he's targeting the snowflake, cancel culture libtards 
So honestly, I’d chris Senft still alive? 
So how about Mark Cuban being a sexual assaulted 
So how about my brunch idea
So how about Patriots training camp starting today 
So how about Russell Henley?!
So how about shady McCoy getting 39 yards on 29 carries the last two weeks

So how about the Bruins 
So how about the NFL getting massacred by the NFLPA again? #hohum
So how about this Stefon Diggs rumor that’s going around right now 
So how about this whole nazi thing in Virginia 
So how do I put my moneys in there
So I can picture a situation where there are multiple states of emergency before they step in and start shutting things down like Italy
So I can't use that 
So I guess I am committing
So I guess it really wasn't your last call
So I guess it's a typo 
So I guess that's the same as your average in terms of per person
So I guess, yeah, I see your point
So I just lost 40 points. I assume it was a glitch 
So I know I am not one to talk about basketball, but did anyone see Nurkic's injury last night? Fucking horrible
So I see that all the dark mode players got it in 3. The eye rapists took 4 guesses....
So I take it no one is coming over for burgers tonight 
So I take it that no one is coming over for my pie 
So I was right when I said "maybe less and it just seems like it was that long ago." Glad I hedged my bet
So I watched it in the predesignated order
So I won the bet
So I won't be participating 
So if Bama and UCF played the same teams OOC, but Bama was 11-1 and UCF was 12-0, Bama would still get in over UCF because UCF didn't play a better OOC schedule than Bama
So if bates is gone, is Daz really safe? What's to say the new AD won't fire his ass? 
So if I rebuy week 2, I don't lose again?
So if the starter gets hurt, you already have the player who is next in line to start 
So if you lose we will have to hear about how you were the best team who deserved to win it all and got fucked with an off week at an inopportune time?
So I'm 93% sure that the Fuckholes could take over Iceland right now. Anyone interested in a career change?
So I'm confused. Apparently marshawn lynch caught the stomach bug that seems to be circulating through NFL teams. So cbs decides to show him vomiting on the sidelines. Then they go on to say that he normally throws up before games but it usually happens in the locker room 
So in 13 years? 
So in a convoluted way, she works for Trump. Good job taking a stand for what’s right. 
So include the cost of a student ticket for the price of their season pass. Not that difficult. The fans that wouldn't take the t to Fenway are the fans who aren't going to stay for a whole game. Either way, they aren't staying into the stadium 
So Ingram would have gotten $100,000 if he scored another touchdown. He got two touchdowns vultured by Tim Hightower and Ingram went nuts on the sidelines 
So instead of simply getting stopped for driving 108 mph last week, okafor should have been plastered, run over a group of teenagers and crashed his car into an orphanage?
So instead you went to Joe's and got into his clothes. Poor choice
So is an "IRA" a Roth IRA by default or is there a distinction between Roth IRA and ira, too
So is anyone going to invite me over for the game or nahhh
So is Bortles but I don't see anyone drafti--- oh wait....
So is giving money to NCAA athletes, apparently
So is James Harden
So is that a yes, kovin? 
So is that a yes? 
So is that golf cart girl or nah 
So Isaiah Wynn....
So it seems as if we are supporting both sides at the moment 
So it should be a tie series 
So it would be legal? 
So it's been about a week. Next arrest must be coming soon 
So it's better to pay into the Roth IRA and be taxed now, since I am a lower tax bracket, so I don't pay taxes when I withdraw the money later in life? 
So it's her fault that I didn't get invited as a plus 1 
So it's not actually the Cotton Bowl
So I've been listening to Chance's new album a bit this past week. What are people's thoughts? 
So Jamie Collins and Von Miller are the two best options I can think of 
So Jamie couldn't be added back because he was deemed too idle.
So Jamie's team had a good week
So JC Jackson. 
So Joe is going to be one neighborhood away from me? I don't approve 
So Joe Kennedy III did the SOTU response for the Dems; Bernie is now going off on Twitter doing his own #BernieResponds
So Joe, can I come over for that fight you DVR'ed?
So Joseph randle gets demoted and then walks out of practice and skips his treatment for his injury.
So josh Brent kills a guy and then the cowboys still hire him as a scout 
So just a realization, Vernon Davis doesn't register a post season stat and gets a ring. Good for him 
So just invite him 
So Kevin and John, when are you going to the wnba game?
So last week, the NFLPA submitted a letter to the judge outlining 19 cases where a federal district judge overturned a ruling made by an arbitrator 
So LeBron esque
So like alumni? Both never get full
So like an uh-oh Oreo 
So like if Employee 1 gets paid as an FTE and they work on a project for 4 hours a week, then the in-kind expense is 10%*FTE?
So literally Michel and Crossen and then Etling
So many fucking cats 
So many meetings* 
So many plot lines of "will they, won't they" and "will character X ever change???" 
So many pundits on Twitter this week defending Cam and saying that the Pats had to sign him in the off-season. What does he do in return? Take multiple bad sacks 
So many rules these days 
So many typos.
So maybe going to the super bowl will actually bankrupt you 
So maybe Wegmans just hasn't done it
So Mayo definitely is not teaching it. 
So me, darrow, Chan, and goody? 
So Monument confirmed - we'll eat as close to Kristen's apartment as possible so Bocker can look out the window longingly and think about his massive FOMO
So moral of the story, Giants should fire everyone except Saquon and start over
So move back here 
So much bad football, this is great 
So much cooler to see the routes and holes open up 
So much for "as many as eight teams in on Bell"
So much for AJ green being suspended 6 games 
So much for being a "players coach"
So much for bocker not stealing Kristen's mattress 
So much for turning his mic off 
So much for waking up at 7 am every day 
So much spam in advance of tomorrow's announcement 
So much that I don't know what to do with it
So my assessment was right
so my flight hasnt been delayed again but the runway is filled with fire trucks and ambulances
So my heady topper and focal banger will remain unconsumed in my fridge 
So my landlord is selling our apartment, as some of you know, and is running an open house during the Patriots game this weekend. If anyone wants to house me at their abode for the game, I'd appreciate it 
So my Roth IRA through vanguard has a -2% rate of return for the YTD
So nice of Nick to wish you happy times during the Jewish holidays when he himself is an outspoken Catholic
So no 6-12-18-24 challenge for another 13 months....again....
So no one wants to come over night
So no, 0% helpful
So not great...
So not only did I lose all HD channels from Comcast, our bill also went up $21/month because our 12 month promo expired. Called Comcast and they said we were never supposed to get HD channels to begin with and that if we want them back, it will be an extra $9.95/month 
So nothing has changed? 
So now everyone who doesn't get a prayer room is going to start driving cars into people and stabbing them 
So now goody owes me $3.59
So now he can catch
So now I can get overpriced meat and produce delivered to my door by drone? I don't need to walk a mile to Whole Foods to get my bank account fucked? 
So now I'm saving Hyrule 
So now I've been sitting here for three days watching people argue back and forth on email chains without doing any actual work 
So now my neighborhood is polluted with shitty music. And traffic getting home was awful 
So now that we know how Joe feels, I feel comfortable doing the opposite 
So now we've had a riot in Chicago and a would-be trump attacker in Ohio 
So now you're going to be known as the straight-edge, body-shaming Pokemon nerd
So of course all those doses are ruined. The news just said that up to 62 million more doses need review to make sure they weren't ruined 
So of course there has been a shitstorm among the residencies because this happened in the middle of interview season. They have since reversed course and supposedly all frontline workers are now taken care of, but bad look no doubt
So Olivia knows a kid named nick from Stowe with that last name. Nick is mutual friends with Scott on Facebook. So there must be some relation, but Olivia doesn't know Scott 
So on brand for Nick to hate the police
So one winner and an entire field of quitters 
So only four of us don't get murdered by a police officer?
So only one offensive touchdown?
So patients are often left navigating a system where they have to wait for prior auths for their drugs or testing to be approved, find out that it was arbitrarily denied (often times these are just denied outright without review to hope that physicians/patients just go away and forget about it), figure out how to appeal it, find out the appeal was denied, and then wait for the physician to have a peer to peer call to talk to another physician who is employed by the insurance company just to argue why the drug is indicated
So people in the south like Morcus who don't believe in masks and pollution control will ruin the environment and then come ruin our cities with their southern accents 
So pony up and stay an extra day 
So poor 
So probably not good
So quit
So remove him
So sad that we got robbed of all actual competition
So sad, @Benevolent Dictator of a Pound Town 
So sad. The fact that this could happen is terrifying. Especially in that airspace 
So select the option on the poll that best fits your situation 
So selfish Joe.
So she can continue to prove her athletic dominance
So she knows who he is but not me
So she made 3 three pointers? Congrats on doing what she’s paid to do 
So should I put my life savings into DK or FD
So should I start paying attention to the Red Sox now? 
So since no one else can go onto the app and look for themselves, Becker started Chris Ivory, who is currently in the hospital 
So someone used my name and email for shipping info but someone else's card and billing address 
So something is fucked up with his GroupMe. I was actually doing him a favor by identifying a problem 
So sounds like so far only Darrow is coming over tonight. Anyone else? 
So still not ruined
So stop going into losing teams' subreddits
So thankful that my BEST friend Goody always has my back, as well as Emyr’s back 
So that answer is no
So that haircut got you whipped 
So that number is very small, which is great, but we also don't know if these people were immunocompromised and thus had limited response to the vaccine 
So that report about Garrett was stupid 
So that was bad
So that was pass interference
So that’s why RI has so many people from Worcester

So the Celtics lost
So the Chiefs think that the call on Toney was wrong?
So the Dolphins are bad 
So the Falcons are bad...
So the Globe is arguing that his lack of commitment puts BC in a position where their athletics suffer 
So the Marcus diet?
So the MLB and NBA are kind of a clusterfuck, huh 
So the NFL suspends Pats players for being generally aware that footballs are soft and for having substances in their blood that are unrecognizable
So the non-severe/critical cases are still important
So the opening team didn't win....
So the patriots shifted the d line on the goal line to draw steelers over the line of scrimmage. Ben thinks it was illegal (it's not) and saw it on film, so he knew the pats liked to do that and they were prepared for it and his team still fucked up. He went on to say that if it isn't illegal, there is definitely an unwritten rule not to do that. 
So the photos of Greg Hardy's girlfriend look painful 
So the Posa winner will have to go to a WNBA game with Chan or joe? That's almost incentive to tank the Posa 
So the Rams aren’t great anymore 
So the Super League may ruin the CL as it is currently run and many domestic leagues are threatening to ban the teams that participate in the SL from domestic competition
So the wind plus Bourne falling
So their whole discography?
So then 71 didn't report. THE FIX 
So then I can stop watching 
So then I changed my vote to this guy:
So then I walked towards her and asked. My mom has a video 
So then she should go to a plastic surgeon. As Bocker and I have recommended. 
So then we should just put the team that won the scrimmage out in the real tournament and we will be fine 
So then where did bocker get put on blast? 
So then why do you always complain about your student loans 
So then why do you want to fight me? #SelfBurn
So then you’re 2-1. Fuck you Darrow. Get your narrative out of here 
So they didn't cure it. That sucks 
So they gave up a first rounder to trade back into the second round and whiff on a 3rd rounder
So they have cheated twice 
So they will stop coming into my apartment and disturbing me when I'm studying for Step
So they're just going to put a towel under the door? 
So this is really really old news (like 13 hours old), but I just saw it. Apparently Scam Newton was benched for taking teammates to a strip club? 
So this is the girl that Marcus so famously plumbed. I always wondered who that was 
So this trip was planned, and despite Bocker asking Joe several times whether he was going, we didn’t know for sure if it was happening 
So this year, the NFL banned 11 models of helmets that failed lab testing for safety. Brown used one of these units his whole career. He apparently freaked out when the Raiders told him this during OTAs. He spent the next few practices trying to sneak his old helmet into practice and the Raiders kept having to take it away from him
So to be clear, he is not a surgeon but gets to pretend to be one 
So Tom Dodge is actually fake creepy dry humper
So unoriginal
So Vollmer over Cannon and Van Noy over Collins ruined my perfect brackets
So was Derek Carr
So was my wallet

So we decided it was worth the extra time driving up to Boston for appointments 
So we got Boys at 1, cards at 31 and bucs at 32?
So we have been talking in the groupme about the need for prevention in healthcare. The freedom caucus is lobbying for the White House to remove annual primary care visits, mammograms, and several other essential requirements that are currently levied on insurers 
So we have qb, rb, and lb/de?
So we saw that place, among a couple others, today and were actually quite disappointed. There needs to be a lot of work done. First, they recently replaced a sewage pipe from the house to the street and the workers busted a pipe leading to the yard's sprinkler system. So now the driveway and part of the front yard need to be dug up. Also the fence in the back is literally falling apart with broken boards and nails all over the place; the fence is also build on top of a cement foundation that is caving in. Finally, the HVAC and water heating system look ancient, and the "realtors" (read: Redfin employees who barely qualify as agents) did not know anything about how old the systems were.
So we should steal them 
So we still all agree that Doug Martin sucks, right?
So we thinking August 2021 then?
So we’ll never know 
So we’re docking Joe $40 and Darrow $0?
So we're just missing the last one?

So when Apple tanked after Steve Jobs died and I told my mom to buy stock and she didn't and it went right back up to its previous value and more, I was a genius
So when are you going back over for more?
So when Cos/Kirks and Ners/Hawks end, then they won't show just the last game 
So when Irsay said that he hoped Matt Ryan would be their QB for the next three years at the beginning of the season, that was a bit premature? 
So when is our fantasy draft 
So when you drop a player they always go to waivers 
So while they were objectively worse, they weren't unbearably worse
So while we still don't know what their original plan was and why they decided to choose an illegal formation, the wide receiver that lined up as center on that fake play said that the patriots "covered their formation perfectly" and he was instructed to not snap the ball if that happened. When asked why he then snapped the ball, he stated that it was a "miscommunication". 
So while you're at a sexual harassment training, you're browsing a groupme titled fantasy fuckholes. I'm sure you're learning a lot...

So why did joe say that goody stole Gordon from him? I is confused. 
So why did no one else put in a waiver claim two nights ago? Ryan literally said what he was going to bid on him in the groupme. There are five teams that could have outbid him and no one did 
So why did you go to Walmart.com
So why did you set that as the time 
So why didn’t you bid more for gurley?
So why do you pay money to go to the gym

So yeah anyone who wants McCoy down the stretch, let me know 
So yeah, anyone want my ticket? 
So yes

So, to ensure that i understand. The original bet was for $20, so winner gets the losers $20. Marcus is trying to say that now he should get a payout 3 times higher than the originally agreed upon $20? 
So, when is he reporting to OTA's?
So, won't 
So. How do you feel about bats
So. Is our fantasy league dead?
So. No opinion based on fact. 
So. No. 
So....
So.... @Jamie Bourque 
So.... Something else
so.........Zoom?
So.....did you finish it 
So.....time of draft....
So....how about the American federal court systems. Busy day, huh? 
So....is there an empty desk near you?
So....where do we stand on this independent investigation @emyrbot
So...how about Trump retweeting a video that starts out by saying "The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat"
So...Warzone?
So...yes
So…..yes

Solution: don't go outside 
Solution: go to a homeopath. Won't need a referral for that.
Solution: pay more recruits to come to BC 
Solution: self driving cars should not stop and should choose to plow over the pedestrians. Maybe pedestrians would learn to follow simple traffic laws

Some doctors aren't getting raises 
Some dude was spewing off information while we were sitting in the park in Davis (refer back to the picture I sent and look for four pokestops right next to each other). He said he is a computer programmer and "accessed" the source code. So he could be 100% insane or lying

Some good news though:
Some guy named Leon found a Nickel
Some guy plowed through people on Bourbon Street and then jumped out of his car and opened fire. 10 dead, 35 injured 
Some kid was going back and forth with me with "your mom" jokes in gym class in 7th grade. I wanted to switch it up so I made a "your dad" joke. Didn't know his dad was dead at the time. Got called into the gym teacher's office, which had a huge window, with the whole class watching

Some of my friends who are actually axe throwing are coming over on saturday so I can't go anywhere else. But I can hang out sunday
Some of the ads that are coming out against Trump using video from these protests are insane. The RVAT, the Lincoln Project, and the new Biden one in particular

Some terrorists aren't your terrorist 
Some things don't change 
Some thoughts about last night. 1) an injury to Aaron Jones and that Hooper drop doomed me more than I realized in the moment. 2) it's pretty fitting that the player who arguably was responsible for me even getting into the playoffs lost the matchup for me 3) at least I know that god doesn't exist since he didn't help me fuck Joe (not literally) 4) I no longer am obligated to provide bocker with a gift for locking up the matchup in my favor

Sometimes a plumber's life involves dealing with some shit
Sometimes before you even get Covid
Sometimes Big GI has to pretend that Bocker has it worse than me to help his self esteem. We all know that Celiac is the hardest disease to live with. It's a miracle that I'm not dead yet

Sometimes even three cocaines! 
Sometimes good players play well but don't show up on the statsheet 
Sometimes I can't help myself

Sometimes you just have to know when to go to the ground instead of fighting for that extra yard 
Sometimes you just have to make financial sacrifices for the team when you're a manager 
Sometimes you only need one doink
Somewhat related, but I hate when ESPN just posts tons of videos of players getting "posterized". It's always the same dunk over and over and most of the time, the guy being dunked on didn't really get embarrassed. WHY ARE THERE SIX DUNKS THAT LOOK THE SAME ON THE TOP 10. IF SIX PEOPLE CAN DO IT IN ONE NIGHT, ITS NOT SPECIAL 
Somewhere Keith Hanzus is borrowing Angela's rope
Somewhere, Brian Urlacher just shat himself. And his hair fell back out.
Somewhere, Darrow is taking a big, steamy deuce on the grave of my .500 season 
Somewhere, Joe just had chest pains and doesn't know why 
Somewhere, Marcus is weeping, as goody has moved on from that peephole 
Somewhere, Vince wilfork is crying silently as he reads that last comment 
Sony helped us win a super bowl but it would feel wrong to pay Lamar now when you had the chance to draft him. Could have developed his passing skills under Brady, kept him healthy for a few years. We never have the Cam Newton experiment and Mac Jones could whine about coaching somewhere else
Sony Michel 
Sony Michel go bye bye 
Sony Michel. Wheel route, which he will catch (unlike vereen) 
Soo that's clearly a FUMBLE?
Soon I'll be able to talk about my favorite apples in more ways than one 
Soon to be #1 sport 
Sooners kicker missed a 32 yard field goal, got an extra point blocked, and just missed a 19 yard field goal with 3:50 left. K state gets the ball back 
Sooooo draft time tonight? 
Sooooo, is Chan ever coming back? 
Soooooo yes?
Sooooooo who is coming over? 🤔
Sophomore year, Goody couldn't stop talking about how he just wanted to be a stay at home dad. I believe he told me a couple years ago that he no longer feels the same way

Sorry for the delay. I was preparing a meal for my lovely wife for when she comes home from work
Sorry for the screenshot. Will have better pictures later

Sorry Joe, not interested 
Sorry Joe. I don't get as much pleasure watching 18 year olds in tight pants run around playing with balls as Jordan does
Sorry Joe. Some of us were removing cancerous tumors from people. I'll try to be more lit 
Sorry Jordan circa 2016, but smoking cigarettes in public is bad and people who do it should feel bad. I ain’t tryna get lung cancer from someone else’s habit 
Sorry Jordan, I just really wanted to call Joe an asshole. 
Sorry Jordan, I think his ship has sailed 
Sorry Jordan, thanks for letting me know 
Sorry Jordan, that wasn’t at all directed at you 
Sorry Jordan, we are only talking about Hall of Fame caliber players
Sorry Jordanzer  
Sorry Joseph, you got outvoted. Should have campaigned harder 
Sorry Joseph. Applying to grad school is really hard. Takes a lot of energy and money out of me. God forbid I try and run a fantasy team at the same time, let alone go out to a bar 
Sorry Kovin chose somewhere I couldn’t eat. I would have loved to see you Darrowball 
Sorry Kovin, I was actually the last person to say that 
Sorry man, I would but fuck your mother and lose my number

Sorry that Memphis is the only team that should be the Tigers

Sorry that the haters surrounding me in this GroupMe can't see that 
Sorry that the two Thompson twins are not dedicated enough to be up early like you and me, Tony I would have answered your question 
Sorry that was supposed to reply to @ABot (Lead Pathologist, 🧢 ologist) 
Sorry that your grandfather's travel got screwed up. That sucks
Sorry to dash your dreams @Anthony Goodwin, BB says Brady will return as qb for week 5
Sorry to disagree with you goody on a patriots related issue, but the afc championship game was not the Patriots' to win. The broncos d is more disruptive than you're giving them credit for. We didn't lose the game because of Brady, but we lost the game because their defense was so good 
Sorry to disappoint, but only McDonalds in Europe is gluten free 
Sorry to hear that @Master Darrowball

Sorry, let me clarify. I know that he didn't know that. But I was pointing out the irony, which was obviously what you were also highlighting. However, instead of making it seem like I didn't understand that you were also shitting on him for not knowing that, I decided to explain why it was extra humorous. 
Sorry, let me post in the "Does this need a separate GroupMe?" GroupMe

Sort of related but the insta algo hit me with a really really overcooked brisket reveal this morning 
Sort of related, but I hate modern artists. They make no sense. Just because one person sees something in a weird way doesn't make it art
Sort of related, but mostly unrelated: Trot Nixon was a fucking boss. 
Sort of related, but on Election Day, Pokemon go should set all pokestops and gyms to poll locations so people go and vote 
Sort of retro. Clean lines. Looks good. Except they are supporting the chargers too hard
Sort of, but lactate pills help. It's more that they use barely in a lot of their ice creams and a lot of their mix-ins are not gluten free, and they don't manage their cross contamination well

Sounds like he just rejected eating with us WITHOUT plans 
Sounds like he should be fired for cause. 
Sounds like he was struggling to me
Sounds like he'd be a perfect addition to a different GroupMe that's looking to fill a new opening 
Sounds like he's got the yips
Sounds like if some people were more dedicated to the GroupMe, they would get an Android phone like @Ass Ketchum  and me
Sounds like it's more of a one person team

Stowe is very liberal and there is only one Uber driver who lives/works around here and he obviously can't work 24/7. I would say 99% of Stowe has not taken a ride share within Stowe (Burlington or another bigger city is a different story) 
Stowe was 50% ice by 11 am this pst Saturday. I got my first pair of my own skis this year and thankfully they helped up a little better than my hand me down pair I was using before

Strategically closer to the Wisconsin dairy industry 
Strategy and common sense haven't made their way to the college ranks yet 
Strategy: if you're in the mid first round, you nominate a 2nd or 3rd (or in the case of the Patriots, undrafted talent). They'll be more talent left on the board so other teams aren't going to want to bid on that player, allowing you to easily claim some good depth

Basically I learned that a lot of special interest groups (not specifically Wall Street) found 501(c)(4) organizations, which are not required to disclose who they give money to. I don't agree with that. I'm fine if you're letting companies finance your campaign, but voters should be able to know exactly who is giving you money and it shouldn't be hidden through these workarounds

Take out is always an option in some places, and that allows you to support businesses. Small businesses are going to suffer, that's a valid fact. But if we end up in a total lockdown because the virus continues to spread, then everything is completely closed down and they suffer too. But you're totally right, people will continue to go until things get shut down. That's why I said going out to eat was not as egregious as standing shoulder to shoulder in a crowded bar in my opinion

"Thank you so much for extending the offer for the Pediatric Hospitalist position at Beverly Hospital. I am truly excited about the opportunity to join the team and contribute to the excellent care provided to pediatric patients. The role aligns perfectly with my professional goals, and I am eager to grow as a pediatrician in this position.

Before finalizing my decision, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the starting salary. Based on my experience, current compensation, and market expectations, I was hoping to negotiate a starting salary of $XXX,000 per year. I am currently in the final stages of interviewing for a similar role with a comparable starting salary, and my annual contract increases in my current position would bring me close to this figure. Additionally, considering the added responsibilities this role entails, I hope we can find a way to align the starting salary more closely with my expectations."
Thank you to goody for presenting us with a legit presidential candidate with a legit and relevant platform. Unlike someone else in this groupme

Thank you. That means a lot 
Thankfully for goody, Google knew 
Thankfully I know that Frankie loves me 
Thankfully their path is not The Path 
Thankfully there is proof that I would
Thankfully your vote doesn’t matter
Thankfully, there are probably only 3 people outside of this groupme who care about me enough to remember who I am 
Thanks
thanks
Thanks  My flight got delayed about an hour. Was wondering if it was actually bad enough to warrant a delay 
Thanks @Chanpagne Papi 
Thanks @emyrbot. You were always my best friend
Thanks @joffbot
Thanks @joffbot
Thanks again @Master Darrowball 
Thanks Anthony. You were always my friend. 
Thanks anyway for your help becks 
Thanks babe 
Thanks babe. I don't actually have any grievances to air. I mean, I hate everyone, but you all keep my life entertaining and I'm going to pick today as the one day a year that I don't complain about something. 
Thanks baby
Thanks baby becks 
Thanks bae 
Thanks bae 
Thanks bby ❤️
Thanks beautiful ♥️
Thanks Becker but I only dabble in law for the benefit of the Fuckholes. There isn't much of a job market for people who have no idea what they're talking about 
Thanks becks, you da real mvp
Thanks Becks. 
Thanks becks. I don't hate you as much anymore 
Thanks becks. That makes me feel better 
Thanks becks. Well the dude deserves every jerk he gets. He's unreal. Would love for him to be on the Celtics.
Thanks Becks. You're welcome for the job recommendation.....
Thanks Big Ben. 
Thanks Bocker, you were always my friend 
Thanks Bocker. You always have my back 
Thanks Bocker. You were always my friend 
Thanks Bocks. You were always my friend 
Thanks boo 
Thanks boo. I knew I would not have skimmed an answer
Thanks boosh
Thanks Boosh
Thanks boosh 
Thanks brah. I'm not coming, because fuck you guys, but I just wanted to make sure I could if I wanted to 
Thanks Broseph. I’ll try and get a link to the posting if anyone is interested 
Thanks bud
Thanks buddy
Thanks buddy 
Thanks buddy 
Thanks buddy. 
Thanks but my dad's birthday isn't until November 
Thanks Chan, I appreciate your assistance and kindness 
Thanks Chan, I have always loved you since our first conversation in the fall after we graduated
Thanks Commish. Glad you took charge. Goody couldn't have navigated us through this crisis. 
Thanks Dan Hanzus 
Thanks Darrow
Thanks Darrow, I can always trust everything you say.
Thanks Darrow. #ThePeople'sCommish
Thanks for adding that information goody, very important to supply that context 
Thanks for always being there for me, especially in the PACU after my first endoscopy 
Thanks for asking #TeamGoody
Thanks for being such good listeners, guys.
Thanks for caring 
Thanks for caring, Anthony. I am in San Diego for the American public health association conference. One of my classmates is from SD so we are staying with her family 
Thanks for checking in though. I appreciate your concern 
Thanks for clarifying that you'll be on Montvale Ave this weekend 
Thanks for coming to the airport to hang out, unlike @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim who has yet to even acknowledge that I was in DC waiting for him 
Thanks for coming. Fuck you for leaving your bag. Hope you had a shitty time 
Thanks for defending my point 
Thanks for fixing it
Thanks for getting back to me in a succinct and easy to read format I stead of posting an article from a random website about why people don't like bubba Watson 
Thanks for giving me a real answer, @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 unlike @The Big Dick Bandit 
Thanks for giving me an out to never do anything nice for the GroupMe again
Thanks for hanging out with your friends last night 
Thanks for keeping me honest, bocker. I'll try harder, just for you 
Thanks for keeping me honest, Kovin. 
Thanks for my invite to the births
Thanks for not letting Bill Coughlin sleep in my bed
Thanks for noticing
Thanks for peddling #FakeNews
Thanks for reaching out
Thanks for reminding me, gutta make an appointment for when I get back to MA
Thanks for sharing the deal Chan
Thanks for sharing your opinion but you're wrong 
Thanks for standing up for me becks <3
Thanks for stepping up and taking action when it is clear that the commissioner has no interest in keeping the league fair and balanced
Thanks for that.
Thanks for the backup @Kevin Thompson 
Thanks for the condolences
Thanks for the idea to pick up Dez Bryant in anticipation of him over taking Michael Thomas for wr1 on the saints

Thanks for the invite becks, but I have class from 7:30-9:30 on Wednesdays 
Thanks for the invite but I have late classes on Tuesday nights and can't commit week to week. 
Thanks for the invite Joseph, but I have some studying to pretend to do during the game 
Thanks for the invite man 
Thanks for the invite to dinner
Thanks for the invite 😭
Thanks for the invite! 
Thanks for the invite! 
Thanks for the invite! Olivia and I will be there 
Thanks for the invite, but I have to work out the next day 
Thanks for the invite, but I'll pass 
Thanks for the invite, by the way, @Pin-Ball Wizard 
Thanks for the invite, Shelbie 
Thanks for the invite. 
Thanks for the invite. I have tons of time on my hands since I’m on paternity leave 
Thanks for the invite. I'll just drink whiskey with Kamala by myself
Thanks for the opportunity Joe. I can't wait to murder you with my shit team and bring infinite dishonor onto your Somerville home. Your corpse is going to make a great addition to the Muddy River. 
Thanks for the recognition chan 
Thanks for the reminder. Goody 🐐
Thanks for the support #TeamGoody
Thanks for the support Jordan 
Thanks for the text 
Thanks for the thought Joe. I probably won't drink it because of this 
Thanks for understanding, fwend
Thanks for volunteering to pay, doctor
Thanks for your concern Joseph but I had already refunded jordan, as of your message. Total loser. 
Thanks for your support Joseph. Honestly, this is really not a big deal in any possible way haha. 
Thanks for your unwavering kindness and for sharing your opinion Joseph. It's so appreciated. 
Thanks friends. I am alternating but my body is used to lifting pencils, not bars 
Thanks goody, that compliment means a lot 
Thanks I appreciate the recognition. After all, that’s obviously what I was going for 
Thanks impressive. Like 3 days in the GroupMe and already added to the 🐩 list 
Thanks Jamie 
Thanks Jboss 
Thanks Jdawg
Thanks joffbot
Thanks joffbot
Thanks joffbot 
Thanks John 
Thanks John. Yeah I'm not worried about it. It's definitely not my first choice and I'm still waiting to hear back from tufts and have three more interviews scheduled so far, so I'm in a good place 
Thanks John. You were always my favorite twin. 
Thanks Jordan....
Thanks Jordanzer
Thanks Joseph. I am sorry for not being clear, only "The inventor of General Tso's" should be added. Not the RIP part. I'll do better next time 
Thanks Joseph. I just got home. CT was negative. They kept me all night to repeat labwork in the morning which was improving so they let me go 
Thanks kovin
Thanks man
Thanks man 
Thanks man 
Thanks man 
Thanks man, but it doesn't matter if the Pats don't win
Thanks man, glad you agree 
Thanks man, means a lot coming from you 
Thanks man, really appreciate you caring and supporting me during this tough time 
Thanks man, that means a lot 
Thanks man. I hope your players have similar performances this week 
Thanks man. I worked really hard to steal it from Reddit 
Thanks man. That means a lot coming from you. Hope you’re day is better than last Monday (I think it was Monday that you died but I can’t remember)
Thanks man. Too bad it's not your year because you flopped and lost your playoff spot
Thanks man. You've really boosted my confidence today. I needed that. 
Thanks Marcus 
Thanks not the only reason becks. It's also one T stop/3 minute drive from my apartment 
Thanks Obama
Thanks Odell. Doesn't lose emyr points for a fumble but gives Carolina d a touchdown. 
Thanks only active hall of famer, Sandy Leon, to you
Thanks Russell.
Thanks Ryan. Always looking out for me. 
Thanks signore buzzkill
Thanks Spaz.
Thanks to everyone for allowing me to be reunited with Tyler Lockett. I missed him
Thanks Tony. That means a lot, I think?
Thanks*
Thanks*
Thanks, rooting for me too 
Thanks. Been waiting for this for a while
Thanks. Hope you have a day 
Thanks. I also think you're a Groupme member
Thanks. I am used to "layman's terms" meaning someone who can actually read
Thanks. I did what I signed up to do 
Thanks. I took it Canon r10, which is also hashtagged 
Thanks. It's a hard job but some of us are up for it 
Thanks. The Internet is back 
THAT
That
That
That'
That "crosscheck" happens a billion times a game
That #Narrative is not consistent with #MyNarrative, therefore, it is #NotMyNarrative
That #narrative makes us look smarter. I am going with that
That @Joff Savarino is one smart guy
That 16 year old about to steal all the high school shorties from The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) 
That actually sounds like a dope flavor
That addazio is a bad coach and being outplayed by Syracuse is proof that some people in this GroupMe shouldn't overhype the team simply because some jabronies put a number next to their name 
That aged well 
That aged well 
That ain't me
That allegedly doesn't guarantee an invite
That also is incredibly false
That and great inbound passing
That Asian girl from Shrewsbury? 
That assumes that I am a taxpaying citizen 
That attitude is how you end up like the Browns 
That awful bridge doesn't deserve your suicide
That backfired 
That background TV watching really taking a step back in quality
That bad resolution makes it even better
That bad? 
That bat flip got me hot and bothered
That BC defender is a man. 
That being said, A+
That being said, I hope the Pats take Maye, 3 starting offensive linemen, two wide receivers, Bowers, and an EDGE in the first round so I am realistic 
That being said, I miss Bocker ranting about his posts 
That big weight you guys just felt off your chest was me officially moving into my dorm in Maine. You're welcome 
That borders kenya which is not landlocked 
That boy is too tan to be Joe bourque 
That calendar is not accurate
That call fucked up that drive 
That can go wrong*
That can't be real. Well, it can be, but it shouldn't be
That can't be true. Don't you know everything is about me!
That can't be true. No children around him have been murdered. 
that cat is the shit
That chart is fascinating, and I want to know how it's changed since 2009. 
That chart is literally exactly what I would have expected it to be, except that I thought that Dems may be more skewed towards responsible 
That checks outr
That Churchill war room sounds dope. Also definitely go to an EPL game and wear the colors of the away team.
That cloaked Joey bitmoji is 🔥🔥🔥
That cost us 14 seconds 
That could be a career stat chart for anyone
That could be a factor of a lot of money for me...
That could be any Anthony Goodwin. Still looking for definitive proof 
That could be anyone 
That could either mean I colluded with him or gang raped him at a frat party
That could have been taken during any Taco Bell commercial
That could have gone very poorly but I love it
That crosser was there to be had 
That Crowder drop was hilariously bad 
That deal is as good as done. You've never been wrong before
That defeats the purpose of getting a room for Darrow to cuck you
That describes everyone in Vermont perfectly. I'm sure since there are only seventeen people who live in Vermont, she can get you an audience with the governor 
That did not appear to me to be a good personal foul penalty 
That didn’t answer the question 
That didn’t seem to post but it’s a map of all Vermont ski mountains
That didn’t work as intended 
That doesn't address your lack of commitment to Fortnight
That doesn't change chan's sexual orientation. Jesus knows all. Or he would if half of you didn't kill him first. 
That doesn't change the fact that @Marcus Bauer is dead to all of us 
That doesn't count 
That doesn't count because they are wrong 
That doesn't factor in quality of life, which is undoubtedly better now because of modern medicine than it was in 1200
That doesn't fit into my narrative 
That doesn't fit my narrative so I'm ignoring it 
That doesn't fit with my narrative 
That doesn't flow off the tongue as nicely 
That doesn't make sense 
That doesn't mean he isn't better than Cam Newton was in 2022 when Morcus claimed that 
That doesn't seem random at all. That seems totally related to this current conversation 
That doesn't sound like anyone besides Jordan
That doesn't sound very fun 
That doesn't suit my interests, so I disagree. 
That dolphins TD 👀👀👀👀👀👀
That drop helps 
That dude all the way on the right is really pussying out by wearing jeans
That dude does not seem big enough to convert from CB to linebacker 
That ELECTRIC energy in the Francis house
That equals the worst day in GroupMe history ever 
that explains a lot
That explains Joe Bourque 
That explains so much 
That explains so much 
That explanation is the worst thing I have ever heard
That extra large sink is a true mark of wealth and stature
That face on the left is so punchable 
That failed to work as intended 
That fake BB phone call was so cringy 
That feels like 3 months ago at this point
That feels right. I would not argue if you had me higher 
That field goal was fucking beautiful 
That first picture looks a lot like me
That fits
That fucker copied me!
That game was so bad 
That game was some of the worst football ever put on a professional field...
That gif doesn't look as much like "swoon" as I was hoping
That girl that stalked you? 
That gives physicians too much leeway to manipulate their "sales pitch" to research candidates to skew the risks/rewards 
That goes for the Winnipeg Jets too, which makes even less sense 
That goody is dead and was resurrected as a pussy 
That GroupMe definitely does not exist
That guy showed us a video on YouTube of some guys in Colombia making cocaine. On a school computer. 
That happened almost every day when I worked at MGH 
That has to be a penalty
That he liked their egg rolls
That he wants to go for the records he hasn't broken next year. 
That he's extremely qualified and would probably be an excellent SC judge. The more liberally biased podcasts are saying that he's too right-leaning to garner enough Dem support and that Trump is a dick for picking someone so conservative when Obama nominated Garland who was appreciably more moderate (and had public praise from many republicans before nomination). Consensus between all sources is that he's hard to see how he'd actually vote on many key issues, because as Emyr pointed out, he didn't really answer shit

That hit on my man Grant Williams was more egregious than anything Tatum has done to get a foul call tonight
THAT HIT THE RIM 
That host is a fucking tool 
That hurts john. 
That hurts. We really should be making tomorrow night about me and not you and your blossoming future 
That I obviously knew 
That I understand. I am not cool enough to be in there 
That I will admit to not caring to know about. What I was getting at is the vow of poverty that Jesuits take versus the lack of that in Catholicism
That I'm apparently racist 
That immediately looked bad 
That implies that he isn't doing that as we speak 
That industry won't exist after Medicare for All
That involves taking the time to get informed and form my own opinion
That is 4 minutes later than you said previously
That is 8 
That is a fair point. Plus airline costs might have been more economical had be booked in advance. Really poor fiscal responsibility.
That is a good explanation, Anthony. I appreciate your insight. 
That is a good point 
That is a good summary 
That is a time lapse of posts from inside the capital building 
That is a true statement indeed
That is all
That is all
That is all 
That is also correct according to Wikipedia 
That is also the fund in which I am invested, too as well
That is an amazing bitmoji
That is an amazing gif
That is an awful OPI call
That is consistent with my knowledge as well
That is contrary from the decision that was made last week or whenever it was
That is correct interesting point 
That is gold 
That is Harvard Stadium
That is hilarious
That is in fact true. I do love to see it 
That is irrelevant
That is not at all my implication.
That is not today's
That is not true. I actually have school requirements unlike you single degree students 
That is one hell of a deal
That is one hell of an inaccurate headline
That is perfect coverage and you can't convince me otherwise 
That is serious 
That is some pseudo science I can get behind
That is the exact time 
That is the link I just posted
That is the sketch 
That is true 
That is true 
That is true 
That is true chan, there is a huge trend 
That is true. I am saying it and I do in fact want to move to Maine
That is very true
That is why I reflexively said you
That it
That it's satire and people who think like that are dumb
That Joe is dear
That joke was made several times that weekend. Glad all the Fuckholes think the same way 
That just means that Wednesday ends sooner for you than for us. 
That just seems like you hate one Indian guy, and thus are racist 
That just sounds like a bad idea 
that kid is not Kovin
That kid who stole it was from Melrose 
That kind of thing doesn't happen with Android phones 
That last catch by amendola that set up field goal range earned him a $150k bonus 
That last line tho 🔥
That last one was me! 
That last picture is from when we were in Montreal 
That last point is pretty depressing 
That last run felt great. Could have run faster 
That late hit on Shakir by Schooler was bull. Schooler didn’t even hit him 
That leads me to a specond request, can we not give Becker the wifi password wherever we draft? 
That league is on hiatus but the Lions remain champs for about 6 straight years 
That legit blows
That limits your available options 
That list was more of me just spitting ideas off the top of my head. I'm of course open to other things as well
That literally could not be more incorrect
That literally goes without saying
That location has a really low Pokemon spawn rate. I would recommend going to one of the pokestops on the main MGH campus. They normally have lures attached to them 
That lol is because the pats are on a bye 
That looked like a touchdown to me
That looked like it hurt
That looked like OPI
That looked like the play where gronk got hugged in the end zone by keuchley and pushed backwards and they didn't call pi. Much less contact on this play though 
That looks delicious 
That looks like a guy who hangs around the local high school looking for girls 
That looks....terrible
That loss did not come down to a single blown coverage.
That lowlight video was literally every play of the game
That Mac post is cringy as fuck
That Maclin doesn't pull out, confirmed 
That made me very lit
That makes at least one list for Chan 
That makes me even more worried 
That makes me feel better about Marcus's brain cells
That makes me feel better for the student-athletes though.
That makes me happy. 
That makes my brother sad
That makes sense. Joe gets manhandled by his little bro and then takes out his anger by trying to tear me down 
That makes the #Narrative sound less impressive 
That Malcolm Mitchell play might have been the most important catch he had in his career
That man has a family n
That man is officially not poor. 
That march 18th weekend....I answered no because I'm going to be in Stowe. But if you guys were coming to Stowe to ski, I would also be able to be there 
That may be a stretch
That may be more accurate, @Boe Jourque . I was trying to watch football
That means a lot to me 
That means a lot to me, especially coming from you. I appreciate it 
That means a lot, coming from you 
That means sooooooOoOoOo much, let me tell you 
That means that I would eventually also give birth to you
That meeting could have been an email 
That meeting could have literally been an email
That might be an overestimate 
That might be in conflict with my anti-gun violence research 
That might be Marcus's danger
That might be the greatest bitmoji scene I’ve ever seen 
That might make it even better 
That might make you feel worse 
That moment when you get assigned to a rotation in Springfield instead of your too choice in Portland, ME. 
That moment when you walk into a store in Stowe and Marika is standing right there
That moment when you want to tell Emyr that the basketball conversation is over, but you're just happy he's here posting 
That moment when you want to tell Emyr that the basketball conversation is over, but you're just happy he's here posting 
That moment when your attending dives into a 30 minute conversation about GoT and you don't have the heart to tell him you've never watched an episode 
That moves me up two spots. I don't deserve that, but I'll take it 
That Murray guy kind of sucks 
That must have been very traumatic. I'm here if you need to talk about your experience.
That must have been what my prediction was about
That must mean that they'll cancel my shelf exam and give me honors
That needed modern medicine?
That never happened, Marcus, just like your “championship”
That new Bob ❤️ Abishola looks fucking lit
That news is 3 days old
"That news is literally a month and a half old. 

^wasnt in the groupme, doesn’t matter "
That number will only continue to grow too 
That one 
That one didn't work :(
That one in Washington?
That one is only open seasonally. Two more weeks before it opens 
That one is today's...
That only covered two of my moonlighting shifts. My total "extra money" check for October should have been $4950. Which is about 50% more than the monthly check for the job I do because I signed up for it 
That part is quite true 
That part is true 
That pass came out wobbling like a penguin with one leg 
That pass was further away from the receiver than Morcus is from being in the black 
That pass would have been money had the SF offensive line done it's job 
That pasta is brown and/or has a brown sauce. That's some awful looking linguine 
That penalty was horseshit 
That personally benefits me 
That pertains to a video posted in the GroupMe so I have trained my eyes and brain to not see/process the thumbnail
That pick helps
That pick was 100% on Mayfield and you can't tell me otherwise 
That picture of FLB is something 
That picture was from months ago. I actually had conference all morning then worked 9 hours. But thanks for your consideration 
That place fucking sucks
That place with the hot honey pizza 
That plan would not be fine for me 
That plaque is actually in the toilet bowl. I shit on it every day 
That play by Landry was bad 
That play is so good, it's not in anyone's playbooks yet 
That play looked dead as soon as rattler broke out of the pocket. Only two receivers to that side and one was essentially already at the sideline as soon as the play started
That play was telegraphed as soon as Baker moved down the line. Jets suck
That play was telegraphed the second Brady moved from under center
That preview doesn't show up on the computer
That probably contributed to his absurd career interception numbers 
That probably doesn't include all of the add ins 
That promotion offends me 
That provides you with what, like 13 seconds of bitcoin mining power?
That puts us at 8
That puts you within 2 hours of Joe. Hardly a vacation 
That rate tho
That really was painful to say 
That receiver seems like he is a good receiver 
That reindeer thing was the worst segment I've ever seen during a live football game. And that includes the Genesis Halftime Show 
That reminds me of Tony Goodwin running around naked saying he wanted to go to Jesus and then jumping out a window.
That reminds me that I have to pay Kovin Zirko to put my name in raffles 
That reminds me. Goody and I discussed having a fuckhole get together the weekend after thanksgiving. Anyone around/interested?
That requires him to have fornicated 
That route did not seem like it was supposed to end like that
That run ended with Olivia backboarding someone and it wasn't me 
That sack helps 
That said, a sex strike is dumb and will go no where
That said, Anthony would happily throw some diaper money at BC to name 24B after him 
That said, at what point is it someone's individual responsibility to stand up for themselves, especially when others aren't around. I don't disagree that it sucks for her to be in the minority in your career field and you should do everything you can to not alienate her, but she should tell him off too
That said, Becker was still always my friend 
That said, fuck @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs 
That said, I understand the seat belt law and have no qualms. Blah blah blah states rights and all 
That said, it's good for bc to keep him for an extra year. Let's hope the new DL coach can put him in a position to have another great year 
That said, most chronic illness, if stable can be managed at home. Things like hypertension and diabetes management can certainly be done without physically going to the doctor, which is a benefit for the patients. If CMS changes their payment models back to normal though, most virtual visits will no longer be covered 
That said, no one is allowed on the COVID side without an n95, so if you don't have one, they can't send you there
That said, Olivia and I got our own room while everyone else shared 
That said, things are unevenly distributed. Tufts has ~10 in their ICU, MGH has >60.
That said....I pick up the engagement ring from the jeweler tomorrow
That same post 
That Sanders catch tho
That scared me. Thought that was gunna be PI. Needed to pick that 
That Seattle d tho 
That seeing a movie was expensive and that I would much rather watch a movie at home 
That seemed like the more convenient option
That seems a bit excessive, but you do you
That seems correct
That seems impossible
That seems like 100% your problem
That seems like 100% your problem
That seems like a lot 
That seems like more calories than a standard donut, thus making your attempt harder. This whole thing is null and void
That seems like the most unappetizing meal I've ever heard of 
That seems mean
That seems more adult than just a simple speeding ticket 
That seems problematic from a budgetary perspective, even in the opinion if a libtard like me 
That seems sexist 
That seems the most fair 
That seems to ring a bell
That seems unhealthy 
That sentence was incredibly redundant 
That she should go ahead and lose her number? 
That she's more dedicated than either Marcus or Joe
That shit sells to people like Marcus 
That shot was a good shot 
That should have been picked 
That shouldn't be a problem 
That someone just used to shoot up black tar heroin 
That song is about sex.
That sounds fair!
That sounds fun. Tell me more 
That sounds just like a pyramid scheme
That sounds kind of creepy
That sounds less fun
That sounds like a poor mentality
That sounds like eating butter with more steps 
That sounds like the exact opposite of what I want to watch 
That sounds perfect. Where do I sign up. 
That sounds pretty non-Greek 
That sounds really shitty
That sounds so unbelievably awful. 
That spot is worse than my small intestine 
That star changed the trajectory of my life
That statement is redundant
That statement remains true. He is a real joke master 
That statement sounded economically stupid. Let me rephrase. They went to arbitration to avoid paying a fair wage to one of the best players in baseball, which would keep him happy playing for your team 
That still applies to some of us 
That still works
That story was, in fact, cool.
That sucks 
That sucks 
That sucks hard
That sucks John. Hope you have some time and clarity to reset and find something that appreciates you and is more organized/not running the company into the ground 
That sums it up 
That supports cheaters and slanders gods 
That sure sounds like good reasoning to me.
That tackle on Hurts, if it were on Mahomes, would have literally  sparked WW3
That take is so bad, it Hurts.
That targeting call in the OSU game was awrful 
That the browns beat the Vikings? 
That the draft
That Theismann Lawrence Taylor commercial was 🔥🔥🔥
that there is a type of cheese I would ever turn down*. got that backwards. Double negatives are hard
That they cook on the same surface as their gluten sandwiches 
That throw away looked just like Brady's last year here 
That throw from Purdy was beautiful 
That throw up the seam where he had no one within 15 yards of him...
That throw was out of bounds 
That throw was trash 
That time of year again!
That timeout was incredibly awful
That title actually belongs to Marc Sessler
That title belongs to sandy leone
That toe better get healthy soon. Have to run that 5k as elmo
That toilet paper was very near and dear to my heart 
That too 
That too 
That totally wasn't Darrow 
That touchdown: very illegal and very uncool
That travel call was the shittiest horseshit I have ever seen
That Trump commercial though 
That two play swing was abysmal 
That type of attitude isn't going to win any games for us 
That video should have been 90% shorter 
That video with the kids was really well done 
That was a bad call 
That was a bad field goal attempt
That was a beautiful throw and catch 
That was a bitch ass call
That was a blip. They retroactively added probably cases and probably deaths
That was a bullshit offensive foul on FSU
That was a catch
That was a completely different time. IDIOT 
That was a false start 
That was a few days ago
That was a flop
That was a fucking hell of a cut block 
That was a goal 
That was a good catch 
That was a good play. 🔥 take 
That was a great pass by Newton right there\
That was a horrible throw 
That was a little freaky, not gunna lie 
That was a lot to catch up on
That was a nice throw and catch though 
That was a notherfucking charge 
That was a penalty 
That was a pretty fantastic run 
That was a pretty nice catch 
That was a problem with older models 
That was a pushoff 
That was a question by the way 
That was a question, not a joke
That was a quote from Jeff fisher on hard knocks 
That was a real boring conversation that I missed
That was a real good looking drive too
That was a really really bad third down 
That was a run. 
That was a sexy play call 
That was a tease 
That was a very disconcerting time for all of us.
That was a very nice sequence of events 
That was a year prior 
That was actually Dom Grady. Tom Brady is suspended still 
That was actually filthy tho 
That was actually stolen from SNL last night 
That was all part of my plan. 
That was also 1 year and 1 kid ago tho
That was always my one complaint about Alex Warshauer's Jersey shore house.....beautiful home a block from the private beach....stocked with 1 ply. Really takes away from the whole experience tbh.
That was an accident, but I don't hate it 
That was an unlucky pick
That was an unnecessary 2 points for Kevin 
That was as good of a game as I remember seeing in a while. So many sub plots. 
That was autocorrect 
That was before this job was available
That was bullshit. He gave himself up 
That was by 2:24 pm
That was clean
THAT WAS CLEAN REF
That was clear PI. I'm outraged 
That was confirmed HOURS ago 
That was Darrowball's decision 
That was defensive holding 
That was discussed the day after the hiking in the White Mountains conversation 
That was either a bad autocorrect or racism. I'm hoping for the former 
That was even worse
That was fairly easy 
That was fast 
That was gluten free pizza, you bum. 
That was going to be my third guess. right behind God's Asshole (Newark, NJ)
That was great 
That was his foot. This is his shoulder 
That was his room? 
That was his sixth post. He already have 5. Learn to count. 
That was in reply to goody
That was in response to Kovin
That was interesting
That was Joe'
That was just directed in general 
That was just me 
That was just meant for the TuneHoles
That was like three seconds after the clock hit 0
That was like two hours ago. Get your shit together 
That was me in a John costume. Sorry goody. 
That was more relevant two days ago but still relevant in light of the accusations tonight 
That was my first guess 
That was my first question but no 
That was my follow up. Becker always understands me 
THAT WAS MY GUY
That was my mistake too 
That was my thought as well when you said Basque was completely different from any other language. I knew Basque Country was within the geographical borders of Spain, so I assumed it was a Catalonia/Spain kind of deal where they speak a dialect. And I could understand if a family only spoke Spanish, because we have a lot of those
That was my thought. I am not a beach whore 
That was not humble 
That was not PI
That was not targeting. 
That was obviously complete 
That was one crazy night. I don't know about Stephen Wu's involvement. I was on the ambulance that night and over the course of two hours, responded behind bcpd for a report of someone in their room with a gun, treated and transported a party guest from their room (not gun inflicted), and activated our disaster response team for the fire 
That was one hour ago, not live. Idiot. 
That was only the second mention of Elon in the GroupMe. The first was in 2015 when John asked if I was an Elon hater after saying that I did not like PayPal. However, I did not respond to his question and lost out on my opportunity to be the founding Elon hater
That was over a decade ago 
That was pretty obvious PI on 3rd down 
That was punishment for giving a way Charles right before he got hurt 
That was racist.... Damnit Ryan 
That was random and was a fact but was not fun
That was real bad
That was real bad. 
That was scary 
That was sexy as fuck 
That was so bad
That was softer coverage than my grandma’s favorite custard. 
That was southern proper. Closed a few months ago 
That was such a stupid penalty 
That was supposed to reply to Goody
That was supposed to say @Chank Hill but it will remain a secret
That was supposed to say hi 
That was targeting 
That was textbook "how not to recover a fumble"
That was the case with the last two phones I bought from Verizon
That was the concept behind the individual mandate. The law required certain essential services and companies could no longer discriminate based on pre-existing conditions, or place lifetime cost caps. As a trade off, the individual mandate was born
That was the most exciting marathon finish I've ever seen
That was the most predictable play call imaginable
That was the party where Chloe ate a whole ham, right? 
That was the worst attempt at a tackle I've ever seen 
That was the worst attempted tackle I've ever seen 
That was the worst covered screen I have seen in all of my years
That was the worst fake punt run I've ever seen 
That was the worst fourth down play I have ever witnessed
That was the worst OPI call on Gronk I’ve ever seen 
That was the worst pass I have ever seen Thomas Brady throw 
That was the worst play I've ever seen
"That was the worst three play sequence in terms of football IQ in the history of football*





*Not fact checked, but trust that that's accurate "
That was the year 2006 but the 2005 season
That was to jordan but also applies to you I guess 
That was total gross 
That was unfortunately a clean hit 
That was unWise
That was what my friends called me in college
That was, in fact, the purpose of my statement. I accept your apology and hope you are having a tremendous day 
That wasn’t even the most impressive win last night
That wasn't an inappropriate time
That wasn't an option because Joe is dumb
That wasn't one of our hypotheses 
That wasn't really a tldr but i appreciate the recap Marcus 
That wasn't the argument that I was making but it is an argument that could be made 
That wasn't with Spaz 
That wasn't you. That was @bockboi
That way we can look back at history and monitor his steady decline into irrelevance 
That will be $300
That will be his own fault. 
That will get him in here 
That will make up a whopping 1-13 in the ACC...
That will teach you to bet on the future of America 
That will unfortunately be the smartest coaching decision Mayo will make all season 
That will win them over 
That worked out well
That works
That works for me 
That works for me too
That would actually be sick. Can I have a ride?
That would actually work
That would assume that any of care enough to read what you write 
That would be $43 for those wondering
That would be a sad day 
That would be a sick trol
That would be a stupid trade to make for the individual getting Adams
That would be an improvement for Cleveland 
That would be another gross example of the white(bread) man stealing from the native American community 
That would be EMZ 
That would be huge
That would be Joe removing his like. Glad he hides behind the internet when he is mean to his friends 
That would be lit
That would be lovely. I can come to you and we can leave from Charlestown. (Thank you for the offer Chan, I appreciate your kindness and friendship. But as I mentioned, Joff postulate requires me to complain) 
That would be nice 
That would be nice.
That would be perfect for me 
That would be sick 
That would be true, if it was a softball game
That would be why
That would bring up some bad feelings for marcus 
That would certainly require her to be more involved with her children than she was during the train ride 
That would end worse than Marco rubio's presidential campaign 
That would give me more credibility to insult him 
That would happen on Bluesky
That would have been called ten out of ten times in the Melrose Basketball Association
That would have been devastating to my moral 
That would have been funny 
That would have been in the same envelope
That would have been miserable if you had to deal with moving from floor 6 without an elevator
That would have been pretty sweet 
That would have been quite the audible 
That would have been very entertaining 
That would have broken the fuck out of a backhoe window 
That would imply that it would occur on a track 
That would imply that you had sex as a teenager, which is just a lie
That would imply that you're the good guy and absolved of any guilt
That would include my voting in Somerville, Boston, Melrose, and RI
That would make BoChangles Nix the valence election
That would make me tune out
That would make sense 
That would make sense haha 
That would make sense. Thanks for always being there for me and taking the time to ground yourself and connect with your body 
That would mean that I would punch pretty high 
That would mean that the Celtics wouldn't make it to the finals?
That would not be funny 
That would not hurt me any more than I've already been hurt by this game
That would require Bocker to have a set of genitalia, which I'm not sure is a given after the 10k fiasco 
That would require Joe to be responsible for touchdowns, though 
That would require me to be in the same room as you. I'll decline. 
That would require you to run 
That would unfortunately be too late, but thank you for the offer
That wouldn't be true if Darrow hadn't kicked Devin from the GroupMe
That wouldn't work. We don't have a run game or an O line to rely on 
That year wasn't his year 
That you know of 
That 🐐gif is 🔥🔥🔥
That*
That*
That*
That*. Hay probably doesn't help either
That’s a bad autocorrect 
That’s a bad look by Gronk but he was 100% interfered on 
That’s a big L for me 
That’s a bingo
That’s a bingo 
That’s a flop 
That’s a good catch 
That’s a lofty goal, considering our fantasy football rules are too complicated to write down 
That’s a lot walk from upper too 
That’s a pretty cold take. Of course it’s the division in football 
That’s a sad statistic... 
That’s a Shane Vereen catch 
That’s a very good point, Jordanzer. Hadn’t really thought of that 
That’s a weak call 
That’s awful 
That’s bad
That’s basically the gist 
That’s because I don’t flaunt everything I do on social media 
That’s because we were always friends 
That’s cuz I am bby 
That’s defamation. I’ll see you in court 
That’s disturbing 
That’s even less of an excuse
That’s exactly what I’m saying 
That’s former team #2 prospect Jeter Downs to you 
That’s fucked up. If you find yourself needing someone to talk to, call Marcus 
That’s funny because that’s sarcasm 
That’s good. 
That’s goody’s job 
That’s how Goody offered to run the other Ragnar 
That’s how I feel but you’re better at articulating so I’m just going to steal what you said 
That’s how super bowl winning jerseys get stolen 
That’s in bby 
That’s incest 
That’s incomplete 
That’s Joffensive
That’s just fucking badass 
That’s kind of the basis of a sin tax. Making something more expensive to convince people not to do something 
That’s like a month of hard work 
That’s like having all the power over a sand box in preschool. It matters for the young and weak minded among us, but not for mature adults with more refined interests
That’s my backup quarterback :(
That’s my coach 
That’s my receiver 
That’s my running back 
That’s my wideout 
That’s my WR....
That’s no joke one of my least favorite 
That’s not a controversial take 
That’s not a real date, John. 
That’s not bullshit. Hard to overturn. Although I wouldn’t have been surprised if they changed the call based on the last few weeks 
That’s not Marcus’s narrative 
That’s not true bby
That’s one of the best agent statements I’ve ever read 
That’s quite the ambitious walking commute. People look at me strange when I say I walk a mile and a half 
That’s such a ❄️ take, that I have frostbite
That’s terrible performance. Sounds like you need a better investment account 
That’s the basis of insurance. You don’t always use it but it’s there to protect you if you do 
That’s the real microaggression here 
That’s to Darrow’s comment 
That’s too bad. We’re going to have to put you down 
That’s what a skimmer would say 
That’s what happens when you don’t try to break the rule book
That’s what I just said
That’s what I just said. Joe stealing my intellect. 
That’s what I meant
That’s what I was trying to say. Thanks for always understanding me when Joe clearly just lacks the mental capacity to do so 
That’s what I’m doing to Joe this week in fantasy too 
That’s what I’m saying 
That’s what I’m trying to find out
That’s what Kim Jong Un would say
That’s what she said 
That’s what someone raping him would say 
That’s what someone trying to hide the truth would say
That’s what they get for having the worst cuisine in the world and also for not being in Tuscany
That’s why Bocker was always my friend 
That’s why Darrow is the smartest Fuckhole 
That’s why I quit baseball
That’s why I said rumor 
That’s why my wife married me
That’s why she still got a mother’s day gift 
That’s why you need a real owner like Kraft 
That’s why you were always my friend 
That’s why you’re the stable genius 
That’s you’re opinion 
That’s your job 
That’s your opinion 
That’s your opinion 
That’s your quarterback 
That'd be fine 
That's "Knox" going to be a touchdown 
That's "passionately making love and sensually caring for Miss Jenn Charles" to you
That's 3 
That's 400m
That's 5-1 Daniel Jones to you
that's 7 people, not 10
That's 984 feet and 3.024 inches for those who don't use the metric system. 
That's 99% of the qualifications, Bocker
That's a bad look
That's a bad look by me 
That's a bad look for Bocker right there
That's a bad picture. That makes her look like she has a chin 
That's a bad throw and a great pick
That's a bad typo 
That's a banger right there 
That's a better bet. Weei doesn't have it this week 
That's a big boi catch 
That's a big boy 4th down stop
That's a big miss by the officiating crew 
That's a big stop 
That's a bingo
That's a bingo
That's a bingo 
That's a bingo!
That's a blocking foul
That's a bold statement 
That's a bullshit call
That's a bullshit call 
That's a bullshit icing call
That's a catch
That's a catch. Can't overturn. Clearly a touchdown
That's a chick 
That's a clown question bro 
That's a cold call every 1 minute and 57 seconds 
That's a concussion. 
That's a conversation for three weeks from now. Because who knows what the teams look like after three more games 
That's a dangerous thing 
That's a detail that I had not heard 
That's a dumb sentence. They said "by police" twice
That's a dumbass rule 
That's a fair perspective, Joseph. 
That's a fair point
That's a fair point 
That's a fair point 
That's a first
That's a first down
That's a flip 
That's a freaking beautiful goal 
That's a fucked up leg.
That's a fucking knee on knee 
That's a fucking OPI
That's a fucking squad.
That's a full college tuition, not room and board
THATS A FUMBLE
That's a good deal. I pay $27 but only get 10 visits a month, and that's with employee discount 
That's a good guess
That's a good guess. Montpelier is the capital and that's totally a french name 
That's a good move
That's a good one
That's a good one....
That's a good signing
That's a great biji (my short hand for bitmoji)
That's a great call 
That's a great idea. Let me pitch it
That's a great point, Marc 
That's a great question 
That's a gross exaggeration. 
That's a hard question Becker. When I stop and think about it, I really don't watch any of the big championships except for the super bowl if there isn't a Boston team playing. I guess I'm a sorry excuse for a sports fan 
That's a hell of a draft class  
That's a hold, not DPI
That's a killer missed PI
That's a legitimate question 
That's a lie 
That's a lie. I can guarantee that she wouldn't be able to get discounted tickets this year. The mountain has been crazy busy and her source of discounted tickets has all but dried up 
That's a lie. Me making the playoffs is better
That's a lie. You could have stayed in Boston and saw him this weekend 
That's a lie. You liked my gif from this morning
That's a little too progressive for my taste
That's a long article for someone like Marcus to read. Maybe you should post a tl;dr for him, and really only him, so he can enjoy the joke too. I am definitely not asking for myself, so just mentally tell yourself that Marcus is illiterate and lazy and ignore that it is me asking for the tl;dr
That's a long way to go just to sell oxies 
That's a lot of hatred, Anthony. At least my wish has him doing something that fulfills him, while fucking Joe over at the same time 
That's a negative
That's a net negative IMO
That's a nice 17 hour trip you got there 
That's a nice catch in the cowboys game 
That's a nice catch tho 
That's a nice hit by Bobby Wagner. Hard to get a tackle in the open field like that 
That's a nice throw and catch
That's a no from me, dawg
That's a no from me, dawg
That's a no go on the Newton apartment we were looking at 
THATS A PENALTY! This a hose job!
That's a penalty, sir! 
That's a picture, not a video. 
That's a play that winners make. Not Mac's fault that that dude is a bitch 
That's a pretty glaring flaw right there. 
That's a pretty sweet stuffed animal he's holding 
That's a quality gif right there 
That's a real bad take right there
That's a real risky search 
That's a real video of the train bringing patients to my ED at 1 pm every day 
That's a really hard question. If you don't choose cow, you give up steak, which would be horrible. But if you don't choose pig, you can't eat bacon 
That's a shame. I guess not everyone can be as smart as Johnny Dash 
That's a shit spot
That's a shit take and you know it 
That's a soft dealer bust card. I hit the 6/16 and see where it gets me 
That's a STEAL
That's a strike. He went around
That's a terrible crop job. What the fuck. I suck 
That's a throwback
That's a total John Thompson move right there 
That's a touchdown 
THATS A TOUCHDOWN BABY 
That's a touchdown dont @ me
That's a tough break 
That's a truly nice moment. Too bad their coffee is bad
That's a Tuesday night for goody 
That's a Tufts training site....
That's a very frequent thing at Tufts 
That's a very mediocre, not great song
That's a weak ass hold call 
That's a weird failed autocorrect
That's a weird shift
That's a whole lot 
That's absolutely factually incorrect
That's accurate 
That's actually a huge letdown. I was expecting a crazy story behind it 
That's actually his penis 
That's actually pathetic
That's after having a winter hat on for six hours. Not my real hair 
That's after I packed food for my parents 
That's all I can contribute to the previous conversations for which I was not present. 
Thats all I got 
That's all I got 
That's all I got today 
That's all I got without chicken or a slowcooker
That's all I know, as I was also in the peds ED tonight 
That's all I will say 
That's all I'm hearing
That's all we want 
That's all well and good but John still doesn't know what the HOF game is 
That's also 8% of older adults. Goody left out the line in the text that shows that >50% of the normal adult population has benefitted from the vaccine this year 
That's also not mentioning how he fucked up the 🐐list.
That's always @Undisputed Best Golfer in the Groupme's opinion of live action Disney movies 
That's America's first favorite past time 
That's an all time bad skim 
That's an awesome slogan
That's an awful rule 
That's an awful take 
That's an easy question. 82% of respondents got it correct.
That's an entirely subjective statement 
That's an extra step. I just want a favorite button 
That's an impossible task 
That's an insult to homeless people everywhere 
That's an insult to retards everywhere 
That's an out and not even close and I'm not even a homer.
That's an unfair statement. Brady isn't allowed to be on money because he's still alive. He hasn't had the opportunity 
That's anti anti Italian discriminating 
That's as positive as I can get 
That's assuming that he's currently having it 
That's awfully close 
That's awkward. I got my invite 
That's bad clock management 
That's bad news for Sanders's health 
That's barely even in DC 
That's basically what the comments to that post confirm
That's because Addazio wasted his potential! The man was a Top 10 NFL TE before his draft stock was single handedly ruined by a bad coach!
That's because at Comcast, it's in their business model to watch people get fucked 
That's because he posted in the GroupMe that he wasn't invited
That's because I was on the Tom Brady badwagoj 
That's because Kevin put a voodoo curse on me with his power rankings. Good thing the karma train caught up to him 
That's because they aren't our rivals. We own them. 
That's because we have no crazy religious people that would follow Cruz 
That's because you are a wonderful fantasy football manager 
That's because you are an incredibly smart, kind, and attractive roommate. 
That's because you aren't a hater and loser. You are clearly a loser and a fraud @#JustFacts✅ 
That's because your dad knows that you're a bottom feeder
That's because you're #JustFalse❌
That's because you're a loser adult who doesn't watch cartoons
That's better
That's better than a normal day
That's better than average
Thats better than I could have ever imagined 
That's bullshit 
That's bullshit 
That's clearly a pick 
That's common with true type I hypersensitivity reactions. You prime your body for a stronger response with subsequent exposures
That's compelling. 
That's cool 
That's cool, I didn't want you to stay with me anyhow 
That's cool, you can be wrong 
That's crazy 
That's cuz of the stroke 
That's cuz we were aiming for them. Duh 
That's cuz you a real one 
That's data from 1/30. Surely Trump has killed most of the by now
That's dedication to Fuckholery right there. Ignore existing work to do research to prove that another Fuckhole's claims are inaccurate. 
That's definitely cheating
That's definitely photoshopped 
That's definitely psychotic
That's definition of selling them out 
That's despicably evil 
That's Devin, not Marcus you fucknut
That's disgusting
That's disgusting 
THATS DPI
THATS DPI HE WAS DRAPED OVER HIM 
That's dumb 
That's dumb 
That's dumb 
That's Eagles ball
That's Eagles ball 
That's Ed Hocholi for you
That's emma 
That's essentially what you said during your best man speech at my wedding
That's even worse 
That's exactly like the South Park episode that transposed tweets over the Christmas special
That's exactly me 
That's exactly what I am asking 
That's exactly what I meant
That's exactly what I said about Gillette. They hoped to ramp up to 5k
That's exactly what I was going for 
That's exactly what I was thinking 
That's exactly what this GroupMe should be 
That's exactly what you get when you breed a profession that has 100% of the power and 0% of the consequences.
That's exactly why I would be voting yes
That's explains why he's insufferable. He went to school in western mass 
That's fair
That's fair 
That's fair 
That's fair dawg
That's fair I suppose
That's fair Jordan
That's fair. Poor Shelbie
That's fair. Yes turbotax
That's fairly incriminating 
That's false. I told you who to vote for
That's fine with me
That's fine with me 
That's fine with me but Olivia still has to drive us 
That's fine with me, was just saying that if you had people you wanted to bring and we had more than six, I'm fine with that 
That's fine, but it's not legal to detain people who are legally allowed to be in the country. Which is what this travel ban did and what everyone is protesting about 
That's fine, I just miss @Anthony Goodwin 
That's fine, she doesn't know who I am anyway
That's fine. Bernie don't need votes to win
That's fine. I just personally feel like there is so much more good you can do for society with a masters in nursing and training through one of the most competitive nursing residency programs in the country 
That's for that 
That's from Insta. I was also not invited 
That's fucked up man.
That's fucked up. Dude got split up 
That's fucked.
That's fucking tripping!!!!
That's funny 
That's funny because Morcus hasn't run a mile
That's funny, I don't remember getting a phone call from Marcus telling me that he was going to be in town. Marcus was never my friend 
That's funny. I started believing in God Monday night. 
That's future Patriots QB2 in our 2 QB system. Put some respect on his name 
That's getting saved into the campaign dirt folder
That's going to haunt my nightmares 
That's going to suck
That's going to suck 
That's good news for goody. It will allow him to fulfill his lifelong goal of being a stay at home dad 
That's Goody's job 
That's great. How are you following it up today 
That's gutta be fake, right?
That's gutta be PI right?
That's her real last name 
That's hilariously dumb
That's hot
That's how 
That's how he got me to be his roommate too 
That's how I feel about ufc
That's how I feel as well
That's how I figured it out 
That's how I got an L yesterday 
That's how I'm interpreting it
That's how it used to be. Until we got soft
That's how Marcus won a completely legitimate championship 
That's how much I care about this situation 
That's how that works?
That's how the 2024 election is going to be run
That's how the Chinese created Hurricane Katrina
That's how the nice Thai lady down the street gives me massages 
That's how they want you to react! Don't show any weakness 
That's how you end a period 
That's how you end up 6 feet under a cement foundation in a new wing of the hospital 
That's how you end up shitting on 12 trees along Storrow drive
That's how you ended up with two kids 
That's how you figured out you were dumb? 
That's how you get COVID
That's how you get promoted 
That's huge 
That's hurtful
That's hurtful 
That's incentive Joe
That's incorrect
That's incredible. 
That's inexcusable 
That's interesting Becker, but how do we get him to stop showing up? 
That's it for me tonight
That's it! Broad is the female equivalent of guy 
That's it? Fuck that. Fuck him. 
That's Joe-level hands right there
That's Joff 
That's Joseph, but your tax dollars are 100% funding this visit
That's juicy 
That's jumped up to 69% sure you'll win 
That's just 2 people this clerkship goody. That's not counting the other people I've heard it from previously 
That's just asking to get your dick lasered off 
That's just because Rubio is planning to be Cruz's VP when Texas secedes after HRC gets elected  
That's just because you weigh less in space 
That's just blatantly untrue 
That's just evidence that the NBA is rigged 
That's just framed to put Trump in a bad light. He had a historic crowd size given the prediction of rain 
That's just going to hurt hard working bookies like Jboss
That's just how my life goes
That's just me mistyping...
That's just savage 
That's just the thing. Think of how many nerds would be so disappointed? It would be so great
That's just what your twin would want you to say
That's Kayla Morse, Joff's anatomy lab partner at Harvard to you 
That's kind of a misleading graph. It doesn't take into account any change in the number of registered voters. Plus I think that the obama candidacies were an anomaly; a large voter turnout. I want to see how that graph looks across the last 8 or so elections 
That's kind of fucked up 
That's lake Louise
That's last week's 
That's league MVP Tristan Wirfs to you. Please settle your gambling debt 
That's less then 420
That's like asking Hernandez to stop murdering people. It's what I do 
That's like cashing out when you're on a heater at the craps table. You keep going until either you run out of money or the house does
That's like getting 11 likes on a post. Not happening. 
That's like not knowing the ruling party of Cambodia. Does it matter? 
That's like racism, but the other way?
That's like saying that I shouldn't volunteer in a homeless shelter because Joe is an asshole and doesn't want to volunteer. Green energy produces jobs, leads to innovation, protects the environment, can lead to economic success, etc. 
That's like saying you spent $51,000 on a $5000 car just because you had a $100,000 budget 
That's like, less than he was projected for. 
That's like, pretty much the definition of a stress test 
That's literally her voice on all her music. Now John is going to tell us that he has never heard a cardi b song
That's literally how bocker got phished and crashed the whole MGH network
That's literally impossible
That's literally just wrong. Everyone should confirm to Bocker and me
That's literally not at all what I am saying
That's literally not possible
That's literally not true. I just only mention the players I hate 
That's literally the definition of "for nothing" 
That's literally the definition of insurance
That's literally the exact opposite of how I feel.
That's literally the issue that is being protested. That cops should work to defuse the situation and not escalate 
That's literally the opposite of what I wanted to know Kovin 
That's literally the stupidest take of all time 
That's literally what I said. We always agree on everything 
That's literally what it is for
That's literally what lawyers are supposed to do 
That's literally what was documented in this Groupme 
That's me 
That's me 
That's me 
That's mean Joseph 
That's messed up man. She's a greater worker. 
That's mildly funny to me, not as bad as not keeping Antonio brown, but still funny 
That's miserable. Fuck. 
That's misleading. Chan hates everyone equally
That's more accurate. Thanks Kovin 
That's more income than I have made in 3.5 years
That's more money than I will have cumulative made from my first job in high school up until my first year as an attending at age 35 (if I pursue the fellowship I plan to pursue) 
That's more unbelievable than any claim @jordanbot has made 
That's much worse 
That's my bid 
That's my defense <3
That's my final answer 
That's my go to order
That's My Guy
That's my hero
That's my most positive feelings about my job
That's my new poem. Hope you guys like it 
THATS MY RB
THATS MY RB 
That's my RB 
That's my roommate 
That's my roommate 
That's my secret, I died inside ages ago
That's my secret, I've been there for 7 weeks already 
That's my series arc!
That's my understanding 
That's next on my research list
That's nice that the Phins realized that if they don't pass the ball, they can actually score 
That's Nickerson Field, idiot
That's no way to live your life 
That's not a catch
That's not a comparison at all to a football game 
That's not a fun fact 
That's not a good goal. That's literally 100% the fault of the goalie 
That's not a relevant hypothetical, because we don't have one
That's not a very good circlejerk 
That's not all Emyr if edging
That's not all he is gunna toss if you get within 10 feet of him
That's not an L, don't know what you're talking about 
That's not as interesting as how to cook a tuba steak
That's not candy
That's not considering the other role players that undoubtedly were needed to win those championships. 
that's not cool, man
That's not Dan's voice 
That's not easy. I need easy 
That's not even an actual crossing. Where the fuck is he trying to go?
That's not gluten free
That's not good 
That's not goody 
That's not great 
That's not him though, right? He's just tagged in the post?
That's not how I spell my name 
That's not how rent works
That's not how you hold a football (if you are not watching the game, Conley just Michael Vick'd the ball and got it knocked out of his hands and like 25 yards down field)
That's not in Boston
That's not included in the tl;dr
That's not my #Narrative
That's not not what I did 
That's not saying much. Leaving you doesn't take much convincing 
That's not South American 
That's not the only seed you planted, apparently 
That's not the only thing Marcus would crush
That's not today's 
That's not true 
That's not true necessarily true. I interviewed at medical school with people in their 40s. 
That's not true. We had a great dinner last night 
That's not very nice 
That's not what @The Man in the Arena (Surrounded by Haters) said 
That's not what Angela told @Ryan Darrow 
That's not what Angela told me 
That's not what he said....
That's not what I heard
That's not what I heard
That's not what I was told by your prior roommates
That's not what you said last night 
That's not what you said when we had our roommate thanksgiving dinner and you ate the cranberry sauce I made and loved it 
That's not what you said when we hung out today Becker 
That's not what your couch said last night. 
That's not wrestling! 
That's O goaltending! 
That's o linemen. Only one d line injury (Easley this week), but too early for them to tell us what's wrong with him 
That's objectively and subjectively wrong because most Americans would disagree with you. 
That's objectively not real coconut. It's strips of coconut flesh that have been soaked for so long in a vat of pure sugar that they have zero discernible coconut taste. Any flavor of coconut you get is artificially pumped back in to ignore the fact that the real coconut is essentially 99% sugar
That's ok John, all good. I am crossing my fingers that it's there next week when I come back 
That's ok, you are allowed to be wrong
That's okay since a judge ruled that JB and AA have to sever their relationship, so this doesn't affect my #Narrative now 
Thats on me
That's on me dawg 
That's on Schultz. You're like twice the size of Mapu. He just let him body you 
That's on you Goody. They're very popular and from Boston
That's on you man
That's one of the theories
That's one of the worst botched snaps I have ever seen 
That's one Post Darrow can't ratio
That's only because @Undisputed Best Golfer in the Groupme isn't in the league yet 
That's only because Drake wasn't allowed to start at the beginning of the year
That's only because said source wanted to eat the burger
That's only because Tony has not been allowed in a church of any denomination since "the incident" 
That's only like....275 million. What a rip off 
That's only the 6th time you've told that story. Can you tell it again? 
That's OPI
THATS OUR BALL
That's our defense. We are so bad that they don't expect it 
That's part of brain death testing
that's part of the joke....
That's part of the reason why we don't know yet whether we will require frequent immunizations against covid or not 
That's perfect feedback, thank you Tony 
That's perfect. Easiest way to lose weight is to have it chopped off
That's phenotypic differences, which are different than genetic differences.
THATS PI
That's PI 
That's PI 
That's preposterous. 
That's pretty bad 
That's pretty consistent with how she feels about me in real life
That's pretty much it....
That's pretty much me right now 
That's pretty much what I figured 
That's pretty rude 
That's probably a pretty ❄️ take 
That's probably accurate but don't know definitively 
That's probably fair
That's probably in Emyr's best interest 
That's probably the biggest steal in our league's history 
That's probably the most reasonable approach I could expect them to implement 
That's probably the only legit excuse for someone quitting this league we've been given 
That's probably the worse way to spend a Sunday that I could imagine 
That's proof he's not after money. Pediatricians make shit 
That's pure gold. I hope you frame that
That's racist
That's racist against people with Celiac
That's racist bro, not cool
That's real friendship there 
That's real racist, man
That's really annoying. They lock the door from the staircase to my floor. I can take the stairs down but I can't walk up them. I just want to get some exercise, fuck me right!
That's really sad
That's really selfish of you, Joe. Andrew Becker is a friend and a Fuckhole. He deserves his legacy honored by voting for a Kirk v Terrence finals 
That's reason enough not to trust him 
That's reasonable. My co-residents asked why I was so good at responding to messages on GroupMe 
That's ridiculous 
That's right, Darrow and I are not on Peterborough st in Boston right now.........
THATS ROUGHING THE PASSER 
THATS ROUGHING THE PASSER THATS BULLSHIT FUCK THAT HOW DARE THEY 
That's sad. It's been on my list to get
That's savage and I love it 
That's saying a lot 
That's saying a lot. I figured you would have known every possible way to eat a pancake
That's says a lot 
That's slightly fairer but I still wouldn't trust any research Bocker was conducting 
That's slightly more racist
That's smart or them. Avoid the weekends. 
That's so Massachusetts April 2020
That's some dedication from a real bama fan right there 
That's some of the worst ball security I've ever seen 
That's something fun 
That's something we can both agree on 
That's something you should have probably told us ages ago. That's more important than you getting in to med school 
That's specifically for Dallas. Without the other two, they won't test you
That's statutory rape, brah
That's still competitive 
That's still completely different from needing a car/bus to drive you an hour and a half to Gillette 
That's still really shitty man, sorry to hear that (as Chan and Darrow already said; hate to repeat the same cliche responses)
That's strange, maybe you should give me your account and password so I can fix it for you. I'll also need your social security number and bank account information, just for good measure 
That's strange, your views on healthcare and social security haven't been affected by your upbringing in a liberal state. 
That's strange. I don't remember the Celtics showing up to the court for a game on Saturday #HackJoke
That's such a dumb idea that it's exactly what is being tested right now
That's such a fucked up ad, goody. Who wants to spend $60 to only symbolically adopt a shark? For that price, it should be getting shipped to my house 
That's such a fucking weak ass call 
That's such an awful call 
That's supposed to be an evil laugh, but spongebob just looks like he's having a nervous breakdown 
That's the act that russia wanted Trump to repeal. The whole basis of that secret Trump tower meeting with the lawyer and Don jr 
That's the answer you'll get from anyone who practices emergency medicine 
That's the attitude of a coach who is going to lead his team to a 6-12 season
That's the basis of every religion that ever existed
That's the beauty of Twitter: tweets live forever. It''s not too late
that's the best special teams play I've ever seen 
Thats the best thing Joe has ever done for this planet 
That's the biggest understatement I have ever seen uttered
That's the complete opposite of what I just said 
That's the content I signed up for 
That's the day I am scheduled to take step 2. Could the world punish me anymore? 
That's the joke 
That's the joke 
That's the last interaction I had with him 
That's the look of an abomination of a human that is contemplating eating his child 
That's the most blatant moving screen I have ever seen
That's the most bullshit 4th answer ever. 
That's the most egregious missed call I have ever seen and I am not even exaggerating 
That's the nicest thing that anyone has ever said to me 
That's the only argument of value on the table. 
That's the only fantasy league that ever mattered to me
That's the only one I ever use 
That's the only one I know of and that was years ago. I just think it's a really good movie 
That's the only way to deal with a lunch thief. Have to make them suffer
That's the opposite of diversifying...
That's the opposite of something to be proud of 
That's the plan 
That's the point. It's supposed to be a discount for people who pay to use the system the most. And no it's not less than $2 with the price increase. Calculating four full weeks with trips to and from work, that's $2.11 per ride. It was $1.88 per ride previously. That's a 12.2% increase in cost 
That's the point. No one would notice he's gone and we still get to keep all the important people plus Bocker 
That's the point. Only real fans should be able to talk about and enjoy football
That's the point. The best team doesn't always win, and that's ok. I don't want to watch Clemson and Alabama play every year. I want to watch the team that shows up and wins the game they need to win play for a national championship. If a 12-0 team loses in their conference championship to an 11-1 team, the 11-1 team deserves a better shot at making the playoffs.
That's the problem with people taking the law into their own hands. That's why every city should be like the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. That way no one has the law in their hands.
That's the real important take away from today 
That's the real reason @🐟🦴🩻 doesn't answer his texts. He's just that dedicated to the GroupMe
That's the right demographic of college athlete
That's the second 55 yard field goal Miami refused to kick. Fuck that shit 
That's the second time you have agreed with me today. You are making me uncomfortable, becks. 
That's the sentiment I am seeing online 
That's the ski resort
That's the spirit 
That's the spirit! 
That's the spirit. 
That's the town itself
That's the true point of arguing 
That's the way life should be 
That's the whitest, most dad-liks joke I've ever heard you use 
That's the worst 
That's the worst attempt at a field goal I think I have ever seen. And I watched BC try to kick a lot of field goals
That's the worst grouping you could possibly pick 
That's the worst hold call I've seen in years 
That's the worst news I've heard all day, Darrow...
That's the worst take that has ever been made in the GroupMe by far
That's the worst trade in NFL history 
That's the worst trade in the history of OUR league
That's the year goody went to grab pizza and autodraftes Austin "concussion" Collie
That's they're "once a week update". You need to scroll down a little to get their up to date news 
That's too bad. I really liked him
That's too bad. That $2000 credit I got this year from being in graduate school was pretty sweet.
That's too hard. Are we going straight cheese? No mix ins or flavorings? Like is smoke cheddar the same as cheddar? What about age of the cheese 
That's too perfect of an excuse 
That's too simple Joseph. There has to be a more convoluted explanation
That's true 
That's true 
That's true 
That's true 
That's true but I still think that's an improvement from the development he's currently getting 
That's true populism right there
That's true tho 
That's true, because I'm not allergic to gluten. IDIOT 
That's true, but it sucks to be the senior class that had this implemented and not get picked to be in the tournament 
That's true, you have to deflate footballs or beat your girlfriend to get any attention
That's true.
That's true. 
That's true. Bocker didn't actually do any of the work, Prima did. Which is so characteristic of everything in their relationship, I figured that was implied. 
That's true. Can't argue with They
That's true. Goody almost died. 
That's true. Half way between beacon and comm ace 
That's true. I forgot you moved back from Houston
That's true. If I wasn't the glutard, mama Goodwin would have no chance of knowing who I was 
That's true. Only ebola patients
That's true. So is Worcester 
That's true. We knew he sucked from the beginning 
That's true. You may continue
That's true. Your companies are probably depending on HR to fill openings. My two bosses did all the interviewing and reference contacting for this job. I only interacted with HR to sign my offer letter and schedule orientation 
That's v wrong
That's very debatable 
That's very different than what Bock posted...
That's very fair 
That's very hurtful, Johnny Dash. 
That's very insightful. Does your uncle have any comments on the western vs. central mass debate?
That's VP of the NBA Players' Association, Kyrie Irving to you. 
That's way more articulate than Marcus is capable of
That's weak as fuck 
That's weird @The Big Dick Bandit. Angela told me that you only take and never give. 
That's weird that they included Brazil in that list then...
That's weird, @#JustFacts✓ made my lift complete the second I met him 
That's weird, I still see him in your lineup. You might want to put Frank Gore in just so you don't lose any points 
That's weird, we were just texting last night 
That's what dead Kovin would want you to think 
That's what federal loans are for 
That's what happens when people like browns fans stay dedicated to their team, while other fans just switch which New York team they support based on how much preseason hype they have 
That's what happens when you don't go to school 
That's what happens when you get the people's elbow to the dome 
That's what happens when you have generational talents 
That's what happens when you have someone who is competent planning an event 
That's what happens when you leave a company that controls the internet 
That's what happens when you let Trump and Alex Guerrero brainwash you
That's what happens when you report false news stories about footballs that went soft due to physics 
That's what happens when you spend all your time studying for exams on court room procedure and not reading McCann sport law's takes on any sports law issue and Googling all legal questions 
That's what happens when you take the ball out of the hands of your best playmaker, Brock Lobster
That's what happens when you trust John to organize an event 
That's what happens when you're team goes a century without winning a championship 
That's what he gets for being pissed off for being traded got a better player 
That's what he uses the bidet for 
THATS WHAT HE WANTS TO HAPPEN JOE 
That's what hitler said 
That's what Hitler said too, which is emphatically DENOUNCE 
That's what I figured 
That's what I figured, thank you
THATS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING JOE
That's what I have been using for data, not sure how the algorithm is different from Brigham but I assume there are a lot of assumptions made both ways and it is hard to say which is closer to the truth
That's what I have Darrow for
That's what I heard all week
That's what I mean 
That's what I meant
That's what I said
That's what I said
That's what I said
That's what I said
That's what I said 
That's what I said! Everyone else is reading on Marcus's level right now 
That's what I was going for but also couldn't think of anything witty enough 
That's what I was referring to but trying to make you feel bad for no one wanting to eat it during the game
That's what I would give him 
That's what I'm hoping for. I don't want to identify with the patriarchy anymore 
That's what I'm saying
That's what I'm saying, but what do I know. I'm only the guy who took the chiefs -5
That's what is said every year, and every year the pats are in the AFC championship game 
That's what it's been since the Somerville store opened 
That's what Jordans Thai lady boy friend said
That's what makes it fun! 
That's what makes me a true SJW
That's what makes the most sense for everyone 
That's what norovirus does 
That's what Olivia didn't want to do because she wanted to work as an RN before feeling comfortable even thinking about moving up to an NP
That's what Olivia does when I throw Backdoor Sluts 9 on the TV 
That's what she said
That's what someone who was on a date would say after a walk of shame 
That's what the bitmoji situation is based off of 
That's what the doctor I am working with told me to use originally. Then he changed his mind and told me not to use it and to use something else that was completely wrong. So I have no clue who to trust at this point 
That's what the Foxtrot Hotels are for 
That's what the NYT is reporting in terms of republican breakdown 
That's what the person who is to blame would say
That's what the public gets for not providing tax dollars to fund new stadiums for teams owned by billionaires 
That's what they call it these days 
That's what they get for holding the convention in Cleveland 
That's what they told me at least. Maybe they are setting me up to get in trouble because I killed too many patients. Who knows 
That's what they want you to think. They look all cute and scared to get your guard down. Then, when you least expect it, you come home from work to see all of your Cinnamon Chex and Fruity Pebbles gone.
That's what we brought to your house on New Years. I've had it twice, definitely not worth the hype. Just another burger place that charges out the ass
That's what we just discussed too 
That's what we've been saying for years but I guess it only resonates when Maggie McIntee says it
That's what you get
Thats what you get for changing your groupme name to one that doesn't work instead of Channe Frank 
That's what you get for electing a mayor that is more focused on painting the street than cracking down on crime 
That's what you get for flying Delta. JetBlue would never
That's what you get for sinning
That's what you get for subscribing to a podcast produced by the worst company in the US 
That's what you get for wanting the "best teams." Meanwhile the real champs are throwing parades and getting government decrees
That's what your gif reminded me of. That's how I like to imagine that it happened 
That's where I rank him. 
That's where I somewhat disagree. I certainly tend to lean towards the liberal side of things, but I don't consider myself an Obama apologist by any means. But I think a lot of what was accomplished (or rather, what failed to be accomplished) in Obamacare was the result of two parties who were more concerned with having their party beliefs represented in the legislature than about what the country actually needed to fix the healthcare system. I fault the government as a whole for not doing its job (registered trademark of Bill belichick)
That's where your brachioradialis muscle is, which is responsible for flexion at the elbow. 
That's who I meant, not Breer
That's why @AbadBot likes basketball so much 
That's why @Skimmer  drives a Tesla
That's why Andrew Bocker is my least favorite Fuckhole
That's why he always hated and stole from me in college 
That's why he doesn't hang out with any girls Bocker
That's why he gets paid the veteran minimum with incentives. To make that tough cut
That's why he would never eat at Fogo for $15
That's why he's coming back to the Pats 
That's why he's going to be ROTY
That's why he's our scout qb this week 
That's why he's taking a job in cardiology 
That's why I added you back to the GroupMe 12 times
That's why I appreciated it
That's why I asked your opinion, Joseph. You are plugged in on the needs of the athletic program, as the soon to be AD
That's why I bet the over 
That's why I call them the Abad Offense 
That's why I definitely agree she does need to do a better job of talking about her ideas and what she is trying to accomplish without straying away from the facts. I think she can still "shake up Washington" without hyperbolizing and getting the facts wrong for the sake of instilling passion in others
That's why I didn't suggest that 
That's why I dislike taking the ball out of the hands of your HoF QB on 4th and 1 from the 3 yard line. Let him try and get the first, he's proved he can over his career; going for the option play with Hill doesn't make sense to me.
That's why I don't like Aaron Rodgers. He's a fucktard. Good at football, but a fucktard
That's why I feel so strongly that individuals shouldn't be punished for their health by being dropped from insurance plans and forced to pay out of pocket. It's just not ethical in my opinion 
That's why I get paid poorly to enter data into excel and am not coaching football 
That's why I included the /s.....
That's why I listed you as the primary culprit
That's why I picked him 
That's why I picked up the most consistent kicker in the league during his bye week to prioritize him over my shitty previous kickers
That's why I posted here. I could acknowledge how much I don't care about him by talking about him in a secretive group chat
That's why I said "won" 
That's why I said hypothetical 
That's why I said IF. No chance that's what he meant
That's why I said imagine not remembering. Because we remembered. Couldn't imagine
That's why I said it was probably very incorrect analysis. I never played baseball past the like 5th grade. I just see good pitches go by on the first pitch of the AB, they look hittable
That's why I said outside of Omaha
That's why I said theoretically 
That's why I started my subscription 
That's why I stick to my one passion, hockey 
That's why I still respect you
That's why I thought you'd be all over it
That's why I was curious about his decision to go to Houston when Dallas is much nicer and right around the corner 
That's why it was a great throw 
That's why it's best to stay fat. 
That's why it's not a real sport 
That's why it's so sad. None of those players have proven that they are any good
That's why it's your busy season
That's why Jordan punched a wall too
That's why known liberal @Undisputed Best Golfer in the Groupme has taken the role of daddy to so many young women 
That's why my good friends @The Big Dick Bandit  and @#JustFacts✅  saw a very likely scenario like this playing out if the virus were not controlled.
That's why some people said it was always a bad idea
That's why the big cable companies were lobbying the fcc to let them throttle the connections to high bandwidth sites like that. So they could make Netflix and other companies lose business and force people back to cable. But the people spoke and the fcc ruled against big business. Hazah!
That's why there are two potential decisions in a Supreme Court decision
That's why they were voted the TotF by the dumb people in the GroupMe
That's why we are bringing in Shanny
That's why we are building a new science building, duh
That's why we make a good team 
THATS WHY WE NEED BERNIE 
That's why we were the founding members of this GroupMe. We embody the values of the Fuckholes
That's why when I went to NYC, I made sure to see the only Fuckhole who was also currently in that city
That's why you always gutta book through the superhosts
That's why you are FLB5 and Caleb is FLB6
That's why you don't browse r/all
That's why you don't gritty when you drop the ball

The "masked" tv shows make me sad to be an American and happy that I don't watch live TV other than sports
The "not advancing a fumble" rule is just as dumb as the fumble into the end zone rule 
The #1 in each division plays the #1 in all the other divisions. Outside of those 3 games, everyone the Patriots play will be ranked lower and thus look relatively poor on SOS 
The $1.3m is not updated for Cam's $1.1m cap hit because the deal isn't official yet
The % that Goody is posting is overall win:loss record 
The 0.3 points he has put up while on my bench today makes the $15 I spent for him totally worth it. 
The 10k congestion is miserable but not a fraction as bad as the 5k
The 2007 Super Bowl getting cancelled 
The 2015 Patriots also had a shit OLine with a coach who got fired after the game

The A branch doesn't exist anymore
The A line used to run through Brighton. Doesn't exist anymore 
The Abad family being in the official Falmouth Road Race insta post is legit 
The ability to tuck and run is such a big advantage compared to last year
The actual law in Australia, which Marcus has of course gotten wrong, is that you are penalized for not going to the polls. You can go to the polls and still abstain from voting.

The amount of babies/kids who get referred to pedi gi for acid reflux or constipation (every pediatrician knows the treatment) is ridiculous.
The amount of meth we could do would also cut down on our food expenses 
The amount of time we as a society dedicate to stupid things is pretty astounding 
The analysis on the touchdown drive is incredible.
The ancho chili wings for an app. I got the scallops and chorizo paella and Olivia got the bacon and kale braised apple porkchop thing 
The anesthesiologist in my case today was Dr. Joffe. 
The announcer is saying that Jennings planted his foot and dropped his shoulder, but didn't move towards the goal line. Dumb call
The announcers for this game are fucking awful 
The announcers keep hanging on to this narrative that the Giants OL is playing well despite them not having any run game to speak of
The announcing crew made that penalty call infinitely more confusing 
The anonymous person obviously must not have known about your Trump impression
The answer is no 
The answer to all of your questions is money. 
The answer to my trivia question was 1941, when two judges without law degrees were appointed. 
The answer was fear of Friday the 13th. You all lose 
The answer was Germany 
The answer was two drives by the way 
The app just updated so I wonder if it fucked it all up 
The appointment of Darrow as commissioner?
The approval of the AstraZenica and J&J vaccines would obviously help that
The arc is made of piss or indicates where Jack has to "shoot" from?
The areas left to count are very strong Dem strongholds
The argument is that I could be better
the arguments that you had mentioned earlier, however, are fair points which should be considered on the goat scale 
The article (Washington post) made it seem abnormal 
The article basically just talks about how he doesn't seem to care for athletics. Doesn't show up for big games, etc. but is in charge of making major AD hiring and helps with coach hiring (o believe)
The Athletic Football Show (famously AR-apologists) are out at AR. Therefore the colts are out
The Athletic Football Show did a whole episode on it a couple weeks ago
The athletic has great analysis but sometimes I just want to know which coaches' butts are on fire 
The Atlanta mayor basically instructed everyone who was protesting/rioting to get tested
The Atlantic's McKay Coppins called the Palmer Report "the publication of record for anti-Trump conspiracy nuts who don’t care about the credibility of the record."
The attire of the Jeffmoji needs no explanation 
The audio/mouth sync was pretty bad in some parts 
The author cites four studies that fail to find "racial bias in deadly shootings." The Fryer paper says, "On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities. On the most extreme use of force – officer involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account." The paper supports a disparity in police brutality, but the author doesn't mention that. The Miller et al. paper looks at rates of shootings per 10,000 stops/arrests. The author of your article doesn't even talk about how blacks had a rates of 1187 and 1404 per 10,000 for arrests and stops, respectively, versus 355 and 503 per 10,000 among whites.
The average women's basketball game on ESPN last season averaged 202,000 viewers. Game 5 of the wnba finals had 583,000 viewers. I know it's not exactly comparable in terms of the magnitude of the event, but the final of the women's World Cup drew 23 million

The bar should be open without a ticket but that's not a problem anymore 
The baseball writers are the whiniest bunch of people ever 
The basic premise (this is not a spoiler, this is only information included in the teaser that's been circulated for several weeks) is this guy from Alabama emails a reporter from This American Life/Serial, and tells him that there has been a murder in his home town that's being covered up. So the series starts there and tells the story of what happens after the reporter goes to Alabama 
The basic version is free
The basketball HoF needs to be purged 
The BB/Brady beef is overstated. How they acted after the Pats/Bucs game squashed that theory in my mind. 
The Bears going in on Wentz is so Bears 
The Beatles 
The Bechdel test is all the rage
The beer hall at harpoon is pretty chill. Lawn on D is nice if its nice weather. 
The being Muslim/Italian/Mexican hurts his chances IMO 
The benefit of that is severely diminished by offering them over $2bil in tax incentives to create those new jobs
The bengals have stopped the Broncos three times, only to get three personal foul penalties to extend the drive 
The Bengals suck
The best character in the movies is that Legoland (sic) guy. Or girl. Can't really tell with the hair
The best character on Veep is Uncle Jeff. Change my mind. 
The best established players out of high school will choose to play for the teams who have the best chance of winning a title. It's not like other sports where teams are restricted by a cap to at least try and keep the playing field level. Obviously some teams are better at using their cap space than others, just as some teams are better at recruiting, but if you were a great football player and Saban wanted you, you watch them win every year, hard to pass up that opportunity 
The best gift we all could receive is adding Dovin back to the Groupme
The best interviews are the ones with Zoom breakout rooms and the program coordinators just move applicants/interviewers from room to room 
The best maroon
The best part about Venice is that there are no bikers 
The best part of October is being able to find good macoun apples again
The best part of that story is that the old man is doing more physical exercise than Marcus. Sounds like Shelbie is literally holding him up as he gasps for air while walking
The best part of the documentary is seeing and hearing from all the old players on the original super bowl teams. 
The best part of the slowmo is that Kattar whiffs on the punch after the elbow like he's shocked the dude went down so fast
The best part of this argument is Jeff Howe tweeting all morning about how he's going to buy t shirts from barstool. He absolutely hates Ben Volin too 
The best player who best fits my system 
The best reason for everything in this GroupMe is spite
The best scene in that movie is the car crash. Hate everything else 
The best team in the league should be the 9ers, the team I have been a fan of all my life
The best teams are the Patriots and the Tennessee Volunteers 
The best thing happened today 
The best time is all the time 
The best vaccine is the one you can get the fastest. #StillNotHelpingMorcus
The best way to beat Brady is with pressure up the middle while only rushing 4 
The best worst thing that happened to TV is releasing a whole season at once. Now when that doesn't happen, I'm annoyed as fuck 
The best/worst part of Trump hosting the event is that he did an interview where he said that "no one has gotten to the bottom of 9/11 yet" as justification for working with the Saudis 
The better data are deaths and hospital admissions.

The biggest farce in the history of farces is ESPNU changing its name to ESPNU
The biggest indictment on Marcus as a person has to be letting 77 unread text messages build up. He cares that little about the people who take the time to contact him
The biggest mistake I made in college (besides being friends with @M. Stribling Bauer ) was putting my number and email on the list for the fake frat
The biggest problem was when Jordan ragequit the GroupMe after Goody made a joke regarding the gay nightclub shooting in Florida
The bill also creates a new oversight panel responsible for licensing all law enforcement officers in Massachusetts every three years. It bans chokeholds and limits no-knock warrants, creates a duty-to-interview for police officers, and the requirement to de-escalate, and bans racial profiling. It also ends the requirement of police officers in schools that has existed since 2014.
The Billiards?
The Bills are really going to hijack this prime time spotlight 
The bills Thursday night uniforms look like a knock off of the patriots throwbacks 
The birthday isn't the same without @emyrbot here 
The blame should really be on bocker for assuming that John to the initiative to make a reservation at the time we determined how many people were attending for the dinner that John was organizing

The 'boys are garbage
The Boys were once such a proud franchise. I don't think the boys are proud anymore. Jerry really had to rethink how to make the boys proud again

The Brock Purty (sic) Bus 
The brocklobster, case Keemun, and (possibly) tj Yates going to start next week. Just as I predicted 
The Broncos have to make the playoffs for that scenario to happen
The broncos really should have invested in getting a good starting QB this off-season 
The Broncos, however, do not have anyone to replace Peyton with, and their defensive is explosive enough to help you out with turnovers and get you points. Patriots have a better back up and a worse defense. Bill would make a change of Peyton was on the pats. He would keep Peyton in if Bill coached the Broncos 
The browns are not a good football team 
The Browns beat Kirk Cousins yesterday 
The browns kicker hurting his knee in a walkthrough is the most browns move ever 
The Browns shouldn't have even bothered trading for Watson. They are a winning team with a great quarterback like Jake Brisket 
The bruins scored the right number of goals in today's game 
The Bucs defense played great. Tom did just enough and the offense showed that it was competent. I don't think they did enough to prove that they deserve a SB birth
The Bucs won't be scoring any touchdowns 
The building I'm in right now is named after the owner of the pharma company that makes oxy
The bungles are hopeless. The players and coaches in Miami actually want to win.
The butt of the joke cannot determine a joke to be a flop or not 
The butt wipe is the best touchdown celebration of all time right? 
The BWAA is a joke 
The cabal rn, if it existed 
The call was just an illegal shift on the Pats but the TB crowd was booing because of the number of penalties they’re calling. Gillislee just looked like he got a stinger on a run 
The Capitol Hill area also has a ton of other cool restaurants, we just couldn't eat at them. Don't waste your time going to the gum wall. Waterfront is fairly lame but the Olympic sculpture park gives you a great view of the Olympic mountains 
The Capitol riot took more from me than anyone else in this country. I walked out of my vaccine appointment with grandiose plans to write a super ASMB Insta post, but I could not in good conscious focus on myself when the country was experiencing an attack on democracy by domestic terrorists. Maybe that is a reflection on myself and my inability to be self-centered.
The cardinals may be bad 
The case of the orpharned hoody has been solved 
The cases we've had in RI are all immunocompetent 
The catch-22 is that closing restaurants will help drive more people into private group settings, so you have potentially more to lose by closing them than keeping them open
The catcher interfered. Pretty clear cut case...
The Cave is also very famous 
The CDC basically left it up to women and their providers whether or not to get vaccinated because there were no data 
The celebrations that are allowed tear acl's
The Celtics blow and basketball is terrible. 
The Celtics should pay my dad his hourly wage! 
The chaos at the end was insane. I've never seen that happen in all my years as a fan
The charge nurse at UMass was freaking out because we arrived with this ?sick transfer patient just as two gunshot victims were coming in. The nurses at my hospital would never panic like that 
The Chargers are the AFC West equivalent of the Titoons

The chef for Dolores in Providence also deserved her nom. I just ate there two weeks ago and it was the best mole sauce/enchilada I've ever had 
The chick who got her face beat in twice 
The chicken satay was 🔥. The salmon was much better in the tasting than on wedding day 
The chicken was not spatchcocked, nothing he did matters
The chief residents from our hospital send out a daily email. This was attached to the bottom of the email 
The chiefs are insufferable 
The child is in a hospital and has a nasal cannula in his nose, which has a capnography adapter. The capnography device appears to look similar to a scrotum, and appears to be close to tea bagging this poor child 
The Chix and Rice Guys shut down all of their Boston operations due to the E. coli outbreak but kept their Medford location, which is supplied by the same location that was the source of the outbreak, because "Boston health inspection doesn't have jurisdiction over Medford"
The Chris Sale extension is in the 5 year, $150m range. I am totally comfortable with that
The circle is not as circly as your previous pancakes
The circus gave a dead elephant to the science lab at tufts to study, so we named ourselves after the elephant
The city is preparing for the worst. They shut down both Park and Boylston stations and even the swan boats aren't allowed to run today 
The city just loans BC money? 
The clock ran 
The closest available vaccination site with an opening right now is 2 hours away, and the vaccination site has not provided appointment availability information to the state website in 2 hours and 7 minutes.
The clots are in the demographic of patients that have the highest risk for central venous sinus thrombosis anyway
The CNBC article is referring to transmission rate, that's what they say is "very rare," but it is well short of a complete thought if you don't tell us what the actual numerical value is.
The co owner of the Celtics did speak to Joe's class at bc. He's essentially an expert 
The colts are who we thought they were. Bad. 
The commanders suck
The comment about the Browns was obviously a reverse jinx
The commissioner at the time exempted him from the SATs in return for a one year hiatus from the league
The commonwealth*
"The company said in a written statement that this week it “successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U.S. Government to the locations specified by them. We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.”

The senior administration officials said Pfizer’s statement about doses awaiting shipping instructions, while technically accurate, conveniently omits the explanation: It was planned that way."
The concept of moonlighting as in going outside of your hospital network to work (e.g. in Scrubs when Turk moonlights at an urgent care) doesn't really exist because of malpractice issues. If there are moonlighting opportunities within your hospital system, you are covered by your resident malpractice, since we do not pay for our own
The condition was that BC would be the host and get more tickets 
The conference call I am on went from finishing 12 minutes early to now going over the scheduled end time by allowing people to ask questions unrelated to the topics of the phone call. 😭🔫
The consolation 3rd place game doesn't count as a real playoff game 
The contact was incidental! 
The contents of the GroupMe should be secret to significant others
The conversation has now shifted towards pooping in Joe's room. Please keep up
The conversation in the girls GroupMe where Joe put you on blast? 
The conversation where it was disclosed that it wasn't happening was a conversation with the groomsmen participating in the upcoming wedding that the trip was planned around. You are being notified at the same time as others who were likely also potentially relying on this form of housing for the trip
The cool thing about being a rich is that you get to send about $1000/month to everyone else in the Groupme. 
The cop that shot the man at Wendy's in Atlanta was charged with felony murder (sidebar: is murder ever not a felony?)
The correct answer is no content 
The correct GroupMe is dead 
The cost of my subsidized monthly T pass went up 13%. That's a pretty significant fare hike 
The country was counting on you
The country, not the Fuckhole 
The cowboys getting the Sunday night game on opening weekend is so cowboys, it hurts 
The cowboys players don't even want him on the team 
The Cowboys were courting him during the season, so I am not sure they are getting a kickback now. But I would 100% believe it if someone told me that the league gently suggested that maybe he go back to football to get him out of the booth
The Cowboys were the beneficiaries of a major missed call on Sunday Night Football? Color me shocked.
The Cowboys would probably be who I would sub out if I included the colts, now that dez is hurt. But I think they can win in a fairly weak division and give a team trouble in the playoffs 
The crazy thing about rent is that it's due on the first of the month every month 
The criteria for getting a Hollywood star does not seem very strict 
The Cubs and Dodgers aren't rivals though? 
The current commissioner hasn’t even shown his face on Sunday. He’s supposed to be here managing the league happenings on the busiest day of the week 
The cut one below prime rib. Strip steak roast
The Dallas punt returner is literally the worst punt returner I have ever seen 
The damage Trump did has already been done. Poor messaging, failure to relax FDA requirements to ramp up testing, failure to adopt a WHO test, lack of organization when securing and distributing PPE.

The Davis square apartment was in a basement, was small, and not memorable
The day Devin was added..
The day is more than half over. Why aren't you guys awake
The day that they announce that Legends of the Hidden Temple will return as a TV movie?
The days of squadding up with the boys is still sick, most of you are just losers now 
The deans are working with Harvard, BU, and Umass to create an "away while home" rotation at other sites but still no specifics.
The Decision 
The defense is worse than last year 
The defenseman should have not focused on calling for offsides and should probably have played defense 
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim 
The definition of the P value is set, but we set significance at <.05. That number is arbitrary because “significance” means different things for different disciplines. I’ve seen <.01 used as significance in other subjects 
The definition of zero is that it is equal to nothing. Since there are zero spots open, there is no space for me in the Posa 
The definitive beta list has been created 
The democratic republic of the Congo? Uzbekistan?
The democrats are so dumb
The Dems letting Biden run again is the worst decision they've ever made
The details are murky, but the point is that Bock Boi bad
The Die In, when people broke into the active construction site at St. Mary's to lie on the ground and then got mad when they got arrested by police for breaking and entering?
The difference is that the Pats got all the right calls and pulled it out because they were better than everyone else. The Chiefs get bad calls made in their favor and only win because of the refs and because of opposing teams collapsing
The difference is that they didn't listen to my WR scouting report until this year 
The difficulty with chronic Lyme disease is that it occurs in the absence of any objective finding that we can look for right now. It is different than untreated Lyme disease that goes on to progress to more severe manifestations. In that scenario, you can test for and detect Lyme. In patients with chronic Lyme, the lab values for the Lyme pathogen are totally normally (except for lyme IgG antibodies which will be positive in the setting of past infection). It is hard to prove something exists without objective data
The dining room requires a jacket I believe 
The director for the MPH program refused to not have class that day, despite a valiant effort by our stats professor who now also has to teach us that day  
The distributor that supplies the garden also coordinates supply for professional sports arenas around the country. When they order beer, they order 1 million kegs minimum to supply all of their arenas 
The Dolphins are apparently not good at football.

The downside of the mph dual degree is we don't have flexibility for when we do medicine or surgery 
The dream ends 
The driver in the cyber truck attack was also an army vet
The dude is 25. He can decide he wants to leave his crazy-ass family whenever he wants
The dude is dying from 'rona and you are dancing on his grave to get more posts than him. For shame.
The dude just showed up and forgot how to play football
The dude subbing in for the injured Brazil player looks like Kelly olynyk 
The dude tried to jump over the pile from 4 yards behind the pile 
The dude was probably mad that he started with squirtle on Pokemon go
The dude who made the decision to not renew his contact also fired Naoko Funayama, who people loved as the Bruins sideline report. So he has a history of making unpopular, bad personnel decisions 
The dude who predated Nate Freese. Final answer 
The dude who stole the jerseys also stole Von Miller's cleats and helmet after super bowl 50
The dude who tried to murder Ortiz was offered $7800. That's a pretty low-ball salary for a hit job 
The dude with the step back jumper is legit
The DUIs didn't help him 
The dumb thing is that they could get a pretty good haul for moving down in the draft if they aren't going to take one of the other QBs but they are just going to sit there to likely take an edge rusher 
The ED has made Bock really salty
The ED is a wonderful place
The Edelman 
The EDs have 24/7 US techs 
The effects of long Covid start almost immediately
The end of that half was certainly bungled 
The end result doesn’t change that the umps tried to rob the Red Sox of their rightful title 
The entire Celtics defense is to have Cleveland shoot a 3 and make it 
The entire Celtics offense is to have Brown drive and get fouled 
The entire line got beat on first down
The entire west coast is doing this. Pick up the fucking pace, east coast, get your shit together. 
The ESPN article actually has an anti-NFL feel to it, while still tracing the pats. It's almost impressive

The explorer one. The giraffe is an extra $30 more 
The FA cup is in there somewhere too but I don't actually know what that is 
The fact that @Marcus Bauer has the audacity to post multiple times in the girls' groupme but not ours is evidence of why he was never my friend 
The fact that he thought that Marcus cared more than is outright offensive. Goody is dead to me. Becker you're not undead to me 
The fact that he wants to make the northeast the center of his political movement but isn't on the ballot in the northeast shows me he's probably not a good candidate 
The fact that I am doing everything I can to be last in your power rankings, and you still refuse to put me there, is incredibly frustrating 
The fact that I am the creator of the Fuckswoles GroupMe invalidates it's existence 
The fact that I was stuck between stops for 25 minutes on my way home today determined that that is a troll 
The fact that lesean only had 13 rushing yards is pretty fucking ridiculous 
The fact that she didn't stop at #99 is infuriating 
The fact that the pats aren't up by a billion is a miracle 
The fact that the whole groupme went to sleep is preposterous
The fact that this game is only on Peacock it's fucking stupid
The fact that Ty Montgomery is playing in any snaps on 2023 makes me sad 
The fact that we actually have neighbors is a huge deal for her 
The fact that we aren't up 200-0 is balls
The fact that we don't have a high speed monorail connecting all major us cities is a failure representative o Obama's entire presidency 
The fact that you can challenge something like that in professional hockey is laughable 
The fact that you didn't jump on that opportunity makes me question your sanity 
The fact that you didn't move your desk into the kitchen, or at least set up a hidden camera, reflects very poorly on your workplace dedication
The fact that you didn't post a 5 year old tweet to fool him got me turned around
The fact that you left Mr. Deed's off your list of quality Sandler movies shows me that you aren't a real fan
The fact that you rely on your wife to bail you out is cheating
The facts are that there are no facts
The facts do matter if they are #JustFacts✔️
The fade is always dumb 
The fade never works 
The fake fade comeback route. Good playcall. 
The falcons OLine is horrendous 
The family consists of like 5 people. 4 crazy people and one semi-normal one. The normal one is trying to escape the rest of his family and has considered moving to Vermont. Olivia's dad got a phone call from that dude's mother accusing him of trying to steal her child away from her and trying to corrupt him.
The fascists at work made me miss everything so far

The fire department and police department say they are letting residents backed in 
The first day in court, the judge was actually really interested in the football issue. Not the science behind it, but it seemed like he didn't believe Brady did anything snd that the NFL didn't get evidence to convict him 
The first ever underground nuclear explosion happened in Nevada on 9/19/1957 
The first guy he hit was a punch. The super slow mo version, which was not shown on live tv, that bocker posted was the second hit. I clearly said hit, not punch 
The first interview is with my department chair 
The first is treated with CPR and a defibrillator. The second is treated with a stent and medications
The first Japanese player was trying to make it onto a team last year. I don't think he did 
The first months of covid where sick 
The first one is not celiac friendly. Everything is grilled on the same surfaces or fried with gluteny ingredients. Never heard of the second option but I'll look at it. Again, you don't need to choose somewhere that is gluten free. I am more than happy just coming and spending time with my friends 
The first part 
The first picture I sent a few days ago is a new tv console. The picture I sent yesterday is a matching end table. This one is a patio table 
The first point you raise: people aren't mad about the choice. Their mad that McConnell decided to ignore Obama's nomination and leave the Scalia's seat open for the entire year, and now that trump has made his pick, he's telling democrats that they have to confirm him quickly or they're going to change the voting rules for Supreme Court confirmations 
The first post I read about it said oppressed. I went to another post and read more and they specified that it was murder. That's why you always #TripleSource
The first season was okay, the second season was out there, the third season was v good af'
The first thing Olivia said when I showed her Chan's photoshopped Fuckholes picture is that Darrowball looked the best. Fucking Darrow 
The first thing we did, besides drop our bags at the hotel, was go to the Trevi Fountain which, despite my low expectations, was still underwhelming 
The first two episodes are pretty dry. Episode 3 really picked up 
The first two years are all together. Year three is split between clinical rotations. Everyone rotates through pretty much the same six areas of Medicine.
The first year my team isn't mathematically eliminated by week 3, Marcus comes up with a suggestion to change the rules to make it so he has an outside chance to still make money. He's scared.

The fuq is this? 
The game blows if you aren't in the city. You can't do raids, the same Pokemon spawn around me in Melrose, and all I get are stupid shitty Pokemon and Pikachu's with hats
The game is on NBC
The game is so bad that they have to talk about the 2007 super bowl that didn't happen 
The game play by play was interrupted with less than a minute left for the death announcement. The Pats were driving to get into position for a field goal. Can only assume that alerting the viewers at home of Lennon's death somehow caused the patriots to lose the game 
The game was good

The gate attendant has asked people to move three times in two different languages and people still can't comprehend 
The gender gap no one talks about 
The general consensus, to the degree that I can understand it, is that what was done was not enough. It seems like the real issue isn't insured vs. uninsured. It's the cost of care delivery and the amount of money spent on the high users of the system. Reimbursement rates are falling and healthcare costs are increasing, and it doesn't seem (anecdotally, based on no actual data) that people who are insured are using the hospital systems less or their primary care physician more (which I think was part of the goal when we made these people get insurance)
The ghost of David Stern is rigging this game like it's a Celtics/Lakers game 
The Giants aren't going to want to deal with his dad. They would never work with a dad who would make demands about where his son is drafted
The giants being up 20-3 and then only scoring three points in the second half and potentially collapsing in the 4th quarter is so on brand 
The Giants really Eli'd that opportunity

The good news is that Phoenix doesn't have any gale force winds
The good news is that the local Home Depot has a hot dog stand that sells homemade gluten free buns and I had my first one today so things are looking up 
The good news is that the 🍑🫷🏻 isn't banned

The house is by no means perfect, and it is a bit further away than we wanted, but the inventory in RI is awful and we had the benefit of this house being listed through our agent's company. The family made the decision to sell it yesterday at 10 am, so it has not hit the market and thus we don't have to compete with other potential buyers 
The house judiciary committee apparently gave the house approval to start inquiry if they want. My patient had fox news on and they were making it seem like the biggest news story of the century

The implications of pausing the J&J shot are pretty significant.

The issue I have with the CDC is not due to its own faults as an organization. The COVID response in the US has been far and away driven by states and local boards of health. Any semblance of a unified national response has been neutered by the people in charge. I have the ultimate respect for the public health experts at the CDC, many of whom have had long, distinguished careers leading research and responses to novel diseases. But it is hard to fulfill your organization's mission to control and prevent disease on a national scale without the latitude to due so afforded by those in charge of the federal government.
The issue that Nick and Goody are trying to convey: At what point to you put being a decent human being above politics? When does a candidate become so much of a bad apple, that they are not morally worth your vote?

The Josh McDaniel's run offense can't survive without a fullback. 
The judge and the NFLPA are really pushing hard on Jeff Pash not being allowed to testify at Brady's appeal. He was co-investigator for the investigation and was the only one out of Wells's firm to edit the Wells report. And the NFL wouldn't allow him to testify, which is unfair to Brady's side and the judge seems to think that that is a big deal

The line of scrimmage rule is dumb. It should be a penalty if any part of your lead foot is over the line
The line to get back through security (a second time) is now wrapped through the whole terminal, around all of the self check kiosks, and back all the way around to the next security gate 
The liquor store I buy most of my stuff from knows me and thus has not carded me in a year. Not sure if I am proud of that or not. Restaurants probably 50-60%. Bars 40-50%

The military confirmed to NPR that she was also a veteran of the United States Air Force, where she most recently achieved the rank of Senior Airman. Babbitt entered active duty with the military in 2004, serving until 2008. After that, she served with the Air Force reserve from 2008 to 2010, and the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2016. During her service, she received the Iraq Campaign Medal, indicating she served there in support of the U.S. war.

The niners have thrown the ball into the end zone like 9 straight plays and can't score. That's abysmal 
The Nkemdiche song is good. "The guy is drunk!" ATN Insider. "I wanna make love to Gregg"
The no added sugar challenge that I posted earlier has been shown to be more effective than just trying to "cut back" which almost never works

The Nugget was 3-for-9 from 48+ yards in warm ups
The number 1 overall pick should have 2 minutes on the clock. You had 3 months to do this 
The number 3*
The number of my patients watching fox news is too damn high 
The number of people (cough Chan cough) posting GoT-themed Insta stories is too damn high.
The number of people complaining to the staff that the top tracer isn't recording their shots is way too high man 
The number of people who think it's ok to play music on their phones in the break room without headphones is way too high 
The nurses are on strike today and the hospital is locking them out for five more days 
The NY Post is the foremost authority on NFL announcing 
The NYT app does not have a dark mode on Android. I have everything else set to dark mode
The NYT article provides zero data regarding shooting. The author says "I’m not saying that the police in these specific cases are free of racial bias. I can’t answer that question. But what the data does suggest is that eliminating the biases of all police officers would do little to materially reduce the total number of African-American killings. Police bias may well be a significant problem, but in accounting for why some of these encounters turn into killings, it is swamped by other, bigger problems that plague our society, our economy and our criminal justice system." He says bias might be a problem but there are also other problems that contribute. The Johnson et al. study received international criticism for poor design and misleading results. So much so that the authors had to submit a correction for publication to change the outcome they supposedly found. And despite issuing that correction, they still faced international criticism
The NYT thingy told me that I would need to find an apartment for just over $1400 to make renting worth it
The objective mark of having a working brain is whether you have been censured by the GOP or noty
The offense is still bad 
The offense moved the ball pretty well against good teams last year with a more dynamic qb and run game

The official number was in the 300s with the caveat that some of those cases were delayed due to a DPH issue and they were actually reallocated to previous days. The number was in the 100s

The old "don't cover gronk" scheme. 
The old Italian man who is the housekeeper for our building likes to make his personal and business phone calls while standing next to the urinal in the men's room. It's rather discomforting to listen to him yell at people in Italian when I'm trying to drop a deuce in peace
The old realtor would text the landlord to say he had a group request day of. 25% of the time, the landlord would tell him it was ok without even asking/letting us know. Luckily the new agent has us on a text thread and is doing all the coordination through us, and not through the landlord
The old stadium was Foxboro Stadium
The Olympics is about representing your country. IMO, if you’re getting citizenship just to be able to compete in the Olympics, you aren’t representing your country, you’re representing your own interests

The only loophole advice you will ever need is that you never need to pay taxes. If the government doesn't care about Amazon not paying taxes, they certainly won't care about a simple individual citizen 
The only massage I've, I got as a high school graduation present. I didn't think it was weird at the time, but in retrospect, my neighbor (who was a middle age female and professional masseuse) giving me a gift certificate for a massage from her is a little strange

The only thing that I can think of is that Savion bent over and it looks like the crown of his helmet jams into Henry's shoulder which could cause a central cord syndrome 
The only thing that maybe could have been said is including concrete things the BC administration is doing to address racial justice. But I am not taking away from the content of the letter based on things that were not included.

The other realtor was just basically a dick and bad at his job. And the way Redfin works, they do a lockbox system where any Redfin agent can show the apartment, so multiple times agents we didn't know just walked into the apartment without notice or sometimes without even knocking to see if anyone was home.
The other receivers are so consistent that he doesn't need a WR1 
The other side of the 8 man refused to buy anything besides single ply toilet paper. I am not poor and this would never do such a thing. They got jealous and stole it from our bathroom. So I hid the package in my room. They found it and stole it

The Patriots 
The Patriots are always legit
The patriots D gas given up fewer than 13 points, on average, over the last four weeks 
The patriots didn't mismanage it. They got exactly what they wanted. Slater just thought they could choose what side to kick off to, which they can't. But they made the selection that the coach wanted. 
The Patriots have played home games in seven different venues throughout franchise history. Give me all 7
The patriots have the number 1 scoring defense, which is what really matters 
The patriots offense may stink
The patriots receivers need to watch that OBJ touchdown to learn how to execute a pick play without being penalized 
The patriots should figure out how to do that some time 
The Patriots would never employ a player or staff member who would break any type of law
The Pats broke the Jets so badly that they traded for Joe Flacco 
The pats offense*. The defense is fun to watch
The paywall serves as a barrier from anyone telling me why it's wrong.
The pediatric ED is literally my least favorite place in the world
The pediatric ED sucks. The adult ED would be perfect if the inpatient side could get their shit together and clone more nurses
The pediatric services are all pretty good. Neurosurgery is great. GI and ENT can be hard to actually get someone to the bedside. 
The Peds ED at Tufts has 5 beds, one attending, two residents, a medical student, two child life specialists, two nurses, and two techs. A bit overkill 
The penal system over penalizing an innocent black man. Can't say I'm surprised

The problem is that you are only shooting for winning a million dollars
The problem is that you tag Bell for like $14 million and then offer him a long term deal for 5yrs/$11 million. That’s not going to get a deal done 
The problem is, I am not 100% sure that the market is ever going to swing back as hot as it was here. Certainly not with an "older" building. Too many new buildings going up in the neighborhood and right across the way in the seaport. I think Joe would be wasting his money if he were expecting to swing a profit
The problem is, you can't have those quarterbacks. They're on other teams\
The problem with doing this months dinner so early in July is that now we have 3/4ths of the month to just sit here 
The problem with where your fracture is, is that it is very prone to rotation. If it rotates or gets displaced, you have bought yourself surgery. The splint that they put on should prevent that from happening. If you take the splint off (which I tell my patients never to do), it could make that rotation worse. Do you still have good feeling in your fingers? Is your capillary refill less than 2 seconds? If your circulation is not compromised, I would first try to reduce the swelling more, keep the arm elevated above your heart and ice the shit out of your hand (don't get the splint at). Take antiinflammatories. If it still is too tight or if you start having circulation issues, then I guess you can redo the splint, but just know the risks
The production/camera work during this game is trash 
The promised land? Like Salt Lake City? 
The pronouns thing 
The public feeds I subscribe to still show up on the sponsored page and I honestly haven’t figured out when they post new material because every time I go into snap, the thing on the bottom right is purple

The quality of this football game rn
The question simply said waffles or pancakes. I did not clarify
The radio announcers said that Nebraska sold 15k tickets, BC sold 6k
The radiologist working last night was very rude to me. He got upset that I told him that there was a right interval jugular central line to address after he published the read saying "Lines: none"
The raiders are one of the poorest ownership groups, which is why they jumped to Las Vegas when they offered to pay for their new stadium when Oakland wouldn't
The Rams are a bad football team

The rangers goalie whose name I am blanking on 
The Ravens closed their facility until Monday. Not sure how they are going to play lol
The Ravens just ravened that game 
The Rays when they sucked and were called the devil rays 
The real answer is it's hard to judge. Just by the nature of the therapy, there are no double-blind, placebo controlled trials proving that chiropractic medicine works. There is a placebo effect the second you walk in the door and someone touches your back, you can't really have a sham adjustment. Most of the doctors I work with are willing to accept that people will go to a chiropractor as adjunctive therapy but would never suggest going to one to a patient simply because we don't know if they are bullshit or not 
The real answer is that I accidentally fell asleep on the couch after dinner and my body cannot physically or mentally recover from that
The real goody would have called him a pussy for ending it

The real story there is how bad the Maple Leafs are for not being able to score on a 42 year old Zamboni driver 
The reason I asked about the reunion is because my family medicine placement was switched. I will now be in Somerville instead of Vermont. 
The reason I texted is because I'm eating at a restaurant in Arlington right now. Maybe I should just show up to his house
The reason why you haven't heard of most of these is because they aren't implicated in human disease/illness
The rebuild will be 100% complete next year when we nail all of our draft picks and they all become starters, including our new franchise quarterback while we also wisely spend our $120m in cap space on free agents who will all over perform their contracts
The recent AMA manifesto provided evidence that care delivered by PAs and NPs costs more and is lower in quality. Pokes big holes in the #KelleherPlan🇺🇸

The Republic of Molossia is a piece of shit for not being more gluten-free inclusive with their value of currency 
The republican governor lost reelection to a Democrat. Before the new governor takes over, the republican legislature is passing a bunch of laws to weaken the power of the governor and the attorney general so the incoming Dems have less authority

The research coordinator I work with is Asian. She told me her mom almost disowned her for deciding that she'd rather get her masters in genetic counseling instead of her PhD in biology

The scary thing is that they're always working to push #TheNarrativr 
The science behind it is actually fairly strong that there is a biological component behind it (with the patients they actually studied). I believe it's a real thing based on what I've learned about it but I still don't think, even as a medical condition, that it warrants such a huge social revolt 
The scores must be wrong. It says they've both scored into the 130. That's clearly impossible. 
The SEC is not a good football conference
The second acceptable answer was Jim Harbaugh. He gets paid $7 mil/year but also has a $2 million dollar insurance policy paid for so some argue that his salary is more accurately $9mil 
The second person in the relay left early and the runner in the first leg couldn't catch up with him. They got disqualified 
The second program is income based repayments. Basically, depending on your loan type, you pay 10% or 15% of your disposable income towards loans. If you're not doing loan forgiveness, this obviously stretches out how long it would take you to pay your loans back, and increases the amount you pay in interest, but with loan forgiveness, you save a lot of money in the long run

The security at my hospital wears bullet proof vests and tackles people multiple times per day in the ED. Shit is lit 
The sensitivity of the test is actually quite low up until 5-7 days after exposure, but data have proven that people can transmit the virus before they ever test positive. Someone is likely to have already spread the virus to others by the time that they test positive. Especially in a sport with as close contact with others as football.

The theme was to let women remain/have an equal playing field in all aspects of life because people are afraid that this administration will take that away, which is fair. Also lots of pro-science, pro-climate change, pro-aca, pro-life themes 
The theoretical assumption that a younger candidate would be more likely to engage and advocate for younger Americans who should have more of a voice in the direction of the political party that they support 
The theories I have heard are basically that kids are getting exposed to fewer viruses due to social distancing and masking from Covid over the last two years, so they don't have the same level of immunity as kids pre-pandemic 
The thing Dems are best at is shooting themselves in the foot 
The thing that pisses me off the most is the people who have experienced no oppression in their life speaking out against institutions on behalf of the people that they perceive to be oppressed. Like the people who are pissed about the redskins name. The vast majority of native Americans have said that the name doesn't concern them, but PC police forces the issue because they want to be offended by something and think their doing something for the benefit of others when in reality they aren't doing shit

The Thompson name was shamed when Bock boi beat kovin in the race around the res. Not surprised that John doesn't want to get in a physical competition for Bock 
The Thompson parents getting way too indoctrinated with urine in their sons' mod
The Thompson twins are already confirmed to hate dogs 
The Thompsons have been saying for years that we need a new plague
The Thompson's love for SEA as an abbreviation is my least favorite thing about them

The three year old shooting was a little triggering 
The throw and catch to Diggs in the 3rd quarter in the red zone was incredible 
The throw was behind him. Less impressive
The ticket I stole from you won 
The timeline may change though. Last year Suh was suspended for the first playoff game on a Monday following a Sunday. He appealed and the appeal was heard on Tuesday. And the appeal officer overturned the suspension the day of the appeal. So the timeline isn't necessarily the same for everyone 
The title of the event is called birday party so he put a picture of a bird named after his two favorite things 
The titoons are bad at football and Marcus Mariota is trash

The Tories are the ruling party and are conservative

The tournament only matters if we win
The trade that changed my life 
The trade was fine. We literally said last week that we could trade a stud for a solid keeper for next year. However, goody, give us a little more say in the way the league is set up. Which I believe is the real underlying issue behind me waking up with like 70 messages 
The train in front of us didn't even make it one stop before it got disabled and now we're stuck outside of Porter

The two lovers who never agree with anyone on anything agree with each other. What a revelation 
The two officers who tried to murder the elderly man in the video I posted have been suspended without pay, but not fired. And no punishment for the dozens of cops that walked past that man's lifeless body

The vibes are vibing
The victims were detainees, not ice agents 
The video looks like fireworks exploded in the car. It looks like it was planned 
The video of the shooting has been uploaded 
The video Trump put out on Twitter is absurd 
The Vikings have quit 
The viral challenge involves sharing a black and white photograph and then inviting friends to do the same as a way to support women empowerment and female solidarity. If you get nominated, then you post a black-and-white selfie with the caption "Challenge Accepted," or #ChallengeAccepted, and #WomenSupportingWomenChallenge.
The wait list for dentists in Rhode Island was over insane so we never left 
"The warrant for Taylor’s home doesn’t clear even that relatively low hurdle. In the portion asking permission for a “no-knock” entry, detective Joshua Jaynes writes, “Affiant is requesting a No-Knock entry to the premises due to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate. These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and a have [sic] history of fleeing from law enforcement.” (The Louisville Police Department did not return a request for comment.)

The police actually obtained five warrants in connection with their investigation into Glover and his alleged associates. Jaynes requested no-knock entry for all five warrants, and in all five he used the same language as above, almost word for word. This, by definition, is not “particular to the circumstances.” Yet Louisville Circuit Judge Mary Shaw signed all five warrants."

The Washington Football Team? More like The Washington JV Football Team
The WashPo also said that police claimed to have consulted with a postal inspector about the suspicious packages. After the shooting, the postal inspector said he was never consulted and there was no suspicious pattern in regards to whatever packages were being delivered

The way I see it, when you say "steroids", the names that pop into your mind are Clemens, bonds, McGwire, among a few other. Piazza is way down the list of people you associate with steroids, at least for me 
The way I see it, you trading them to me allows you to have space to carry another keeper. I would be doing you a favor by taking them off your hands. You should pay me $5 towards the draft next year 
The way or the path
The way Smoltz is talking about leaving Erod in is making me think of Grady Little and Pedro
The way that the Halo franchise is sold on Steam, they actually allow you to match into any of the multiplayer Halo games.

The WHO screwed up their messaging about an important issue regarding a deadly infectious disease? Color me shocked. 
The whole concept of social distancing only works if as many people implement it as possible. I personally am of the belief that not making plans to go out for the next couple weeks may have no bearing on my own health, but will help contribute to the public health of society. That being said, j don't think going to a restaurant is a "dumb asshole" move, but I also think it's not the smartest move either. That being said, it's not nearly as absurd as going to a bar that is packed shoulder to shoulder and had a line out the door and around the block 
THE WHOLE DRAFT IS EXPONENTIALLY MORE UNPREDICTABLE! Is it going to rain? Is it going to snow? Is some electrical equipment going to get wet and start a huge fire? Will it be 80 degrees? 20 degrees? Will a bird fly into the TelePrompTer? 
The whole goal was to move out as soon as possible so I was not moving in the middle of third year...
The whole grading process is a scam but that's how you make money

The whole league should fold and disappear from my life 
The whole mission would be kaput 
The whole NBA would have it by now...
The whole parking area was closed off during most of the pandemic, I do not know if it is back open again.
The whole point is that the system is set up to arrest black people. The overall demographics of drug dealers is not as important as how many black people, relative to the overall population, are being arrested or being served warrants.
The whole point of the flu shot is to induce a very mild, limited immune response. If you "got sick" it was either because you got an unrelated cold or your body is a bitch
The whole post count is invalid 
The whole puzzle was easy...

The whole team is fraudulent

The wilcoxon rank sum was the one he told me to do. But it's a paired test, so the two samples of data need to be related

There are a bunch of places in Rhode Island who have programmed their tipping screen to show default tipping options for 20%/22%/25% instead if 15%/18%/20% and its infuriating
There are a couple scenarios that explain how Marcus is both a poor and a not a poor. 1) He sold all of the gifts that he and Shelbie got for their wedding and is blowing the money on an extravagant lifestyle that will surely vanish in less than a year. 2) Shelbie is actually a drug lord and is using the money she has made and laundered to pamper Marcus. Think of it like husband hush money. 3) Marcus has a secret identity fraud business where he steals other people's credit card information and charges them for everything he buys. 4) Marcus has been lying about grad school and somehow tricked the US government to give him loans despite not actually being a registered student at U of Chicago. 5) Shelbie and Marcus still participate in the dowry system of marriage, and Shelbie's parents, who secretly own all Carl's Jr and Hardee's franchises in the greater Atlanta metropolitan area, have paid a large sum of money to Marcus for marrying their daughter.
There are a lot of other players I don't like because I think they are overhyped or get too much credit/attention for being mediocre players, or players that don't play to their potential, but I can't say there is anyone else I hate. Only person I can think of is the center for the lions last year. I think they cut him and no one picked him up, but he was a fucking cunt

There have been a lot of counter-articles about how quickly the number of heart attacks and strokes coming into the ED has plummeted. People are certainly still having heart attacks, and it is likely that covid has caused a large number of people to die from non-covid causes 
There have been many times where I read the groupme and think "wow, this is the most pointless argument we've ever had." All those other times, I was wrong. THIS is the most pointless argument we have ever had. 
There have been multiple studies during the pandemic arguing against the use of infrared thermometers.

There is a clip from one of the mic'd up programs where he's talking to BB on the sidelines during Edelman's rookie year. Wes is sitting that game due to injury and BB comes over and tells him essentially that Edelman is going to force welker out of his starting role because he works so hard and welker kind of just laughs in his face.

There is no hope for you
There is no hype. Stop saying that there's hype
There is no loyalty if you want to win. Except for Tom Brady 
There is no one who I would rather fight to my death with than Bock
There is no other GroupMe
There is no reason this couldn't start at noon. 
There is no shortened version. There are like a dozen scenarios with three different teams. No one knows because the teams have to propose relocation to the league and the owners need to approve it (I think). But apparently no one has really presented realistic scenarios yet 
There is no train to the gulag. You have to walk 15 miles uphill on hot coals without shoes on while listening to Bocker read a Spanish language novella on audible 
There is no way that the person in that photo hasn't raped at least 12 children
There is no way you could lose
There is not a single bad trope in this GroupMe 
There is nothing bad about being team softbody, except that it means you failed at life and should off yourself in a method involving the Tobin
There is nothing good about Pennsylvania. It's 99% west virginia-esque, .1% Amish, and .9% shitty Philly people 
There is nothing lower than Florida man
There is nothing redeeming about this team 
There is nothing redeeming from Melrose except Don Orsillo 
There is one across the street but I can't access it from my office 
There is one physician at Maine Med who comes down to Tufts to teach us about reproductive endocrinology. He advocates for giving medication to essentially block puberty from happening while referring patients to therapy until at least age 16 before making a decision on which way to proceed. That always seemed fairly reasonable
There is one qb with more wins. 10 total
There is one where a medic identifies herself as a medic and still gets pepper sprayed
There is only a penalty for 8 and 9. Not 7 
There is only one GroupMe member who would do that 
There is only one receiver this year who has at least 100 yards against the Falcons. Who is it?
There is parking but emyr won't want to drive around the block until he finds it 
There is parking literally right out front 
There is plenty of parking....
There is probably a karaoke thing in Boston too 
There is probably a legal component (i.e. the legality of isolating patients with TB and leprosy, historically), versus quarantining laws within public health emergencies/infectious disease outbreaks, but that is above my paygrade
There is quite a lot you can eat on a gluten free diet....
There is someone in here who chose Cadbury eggs and you’re calling me psychotic 
There is still a second half bby
There is still time
There is zero evidence that that happened
There is zero reason Mahomes should ever be able to scramble for 20 yards/touchdowns like he has this year. You should easily be able to cover his receivers (who are a broken down Kelce, JuJu who is still not 30 years old somehow, Hollywood Brown, and Tyquan Thornton) while having someone responsible for Mahomes 
There is zero reason to have him on the field over James white 
There isn’t one in Chelsea 
There isn't a morgue big enough to fit the body bag that Bock Boi just stuffed Morcus into 
There isn't anything to listen to. They released an episode at the beginning of last week and said they would release another before the weekend. It's now been over a week and they haven't produced a show and no update why. Reddit is analyzing each hero's social media posts to try to get some clues and most people are convinced that they were the latest NFL media cuts 
There isn't discharge with yeast infections, IDIOT
There isn't even 8 hours of stuff to do on clash unless you're dropping wads of cash 
There isn't even one in western Mass according to their website
There it is 
There may be an expulsion as a result
There may be more rotations during your third year depending on the school. 
There may be something wrong with you if you legitimately have not even heard that song in passing. Like they play it in retail stores, still play it on the radio, etc. 
There might be more, I can't remember 
There must be some decision making gene that's turned off
There really should be football every night of the week. It makes life more enjoyable 
There should be better teams if they want to make the super league 
There should be more shame on these faces for not being dedicated to the semiannual post count 
There should have been, I think, 4 pieces of paper in the envelope. 
There should never be a line of 30 people on the jetway. Especially when the flight only has 60 people 
There should only be one Tigers in division I football 
There totally is merit. The issue is with newer medications. They are more effective but also cost a boatload more and patients often suffer while they wait for approval
There used to be a birthday place on Route 1 that had a big volcano on the outside, mini golf, basketball courts, arcades. I remember that being pretty fun too 
There used to be a skate shop in Melrose. I got a board with flames on the bottom. It went really fast 
There used to be an alcoholic who would end up in the er where I worked every other day who would consistently have a BAC above .550 regularly. Should be impossible, but not if you're really good at drinking apparently. 
There used to be some episodes on Netflix I think? You could always catch up 
There was a 75% chance that Lauren would kill me. There is a 100% chance that either of those two would kill me 
There was a bad word just uttered on TV
There was a bear in their backyard yesterday. I'm going to feed Bocker to it 
There was a doctor in the Boston area that was notorious for prescribing levothyroxine to patients with normal TSH/T4 levels because they complained of having the symptoms of hypothyroidism 
There was a great sale over Christmas on Amazon that you missed 
There was a groupme verbal altercation regarding el pelon vs Anna's. I feared for my life that day 
There was a Japanese player in the veteran combine (not an NFL veteran, but I believe he played in the CFL and was accepted to the veteran combine) and he was going to be the first Asian in the NFL. He did not make it 
There was a microburst a couple of summers ago that destroyed most of the trees and there wasn't really a safe path to navigate through so they've been off limits since then 
There was a picture of a group of lawyers sitting on the floor of JFK offering pro bono services for anyone detained 
There was a reason why Darrow was the best fuckhole who ever lived 
There was a Reddit post titled "'Never going to give you up' sped up every time Rick Astley says 'never'". I watched almost the whole rick roll video waiting for it to speed up. It never did 
There was a sabotage on cutthroat kitchen like that. Except they were churning ice cream as you pedal 
There was a Science Friday podcast a few weeks ago with a presidential polling expert basically talking about how the current polling structure sucks. He talked about the issue of not having landlines, like Joe mentioned, and a few other things. It was an interesting listen 
There was a shooting right across the street from my ED today 
There was a similarly themed article by ESPN saying how the pats have the least number of black coaches in the league and questioning their hiring practices. Jeff Howe interviewed the two black coaches who basically said that BB is fair to everyone and the other past black coaches left on their own accord. Also, the pats have one of the smallest coaching staffs in the league, which skews their numbers. Just my opinion. 
There was a spot around Davis last night where you could sit and be in range of four pokestops. There were at least 60 people there last night. I went on a run and stopped by there, hoping to get a Pokemon or two. I got nothing. I feel ripped off still 
There was a story in ESPN a while back about some wnba player who also plays in Europe, and her European team paid her to not play the wnba season so she could rest for the European league. That's some bullshit right there
There was a team that did all of the physician mortgage loans separately from the usual mortgage process so YMMV 
There was a vaporeon in my square but I didn't have Pokevision to find it so it fucking disappeared 
There was actually an article from Mike Florio the other day suggestions a possible switch of the Rams and changers franchises 
There was also a fade from Brissett to Gronk against the Texans that didn't connect 
There was also a report circulating late last night that flight crews with passports from the banned nations would be barred from entering the country, which also seemed like an egregious afterthought
There was also a rumor that Vail was buying both Stowe and Smuggler's Notch (since Smuggs is right on the other side of Stowe) and combining the resorts, but I don't see anything about that as of yet 
There was also the time where we moved the draft to a time that Bocker specifically could participate and then he demanded that we move it again because he forgot about a dinner with Kristen's family or something of the like
There was an athlete who literally just got her Russian citizenship a month ago. Give me a legit reason why she should be competing for Russia 
There was an earthquake in MA this morning 
There was an ex military guy who was arrested over there after being accused of spying on Russia. I would be so pissed if I were him/his family 
There was another point that was made that I can't remember/find now 
There was contact on that one? I didn't see it? /s
There was exactly no separation
There was less coverage on this play than with goody
There was no chin pubes bitmoji. Not my fault 
There was no hype. Stop saying there was hype. 
There was no need to put him in the game in the 7th with that big of a lead 
There was no plywood used
There was no pull of consequence
There was no space there, especially when you're running into Chris Jones. You have to audible that at the line if you see it 
There was nothing there...
There was one alumni night in 2016 and BCPD kicked them out of a room they were eating dinner in during half time 
There was zero discussion on this issue other than "what do you guys think of this rule" followed by no arguments in support or opposition and no confirmation that the rule was ever affirmed 
There wasn't going to be any gluten free food
There we go 
There we go 
There we go! Needed a flag 
There we go. Think I had a TIA there.
There were a couple times where white was open in the flat for a solid five or six yards, minimum, and Brady was heaving balls ten yards over Hogan's head. 
There were a lot of them who looked single and ready to mingle. And by mingle, I mean go to the mfa and then get railed in the backseat of a sedan under the 93 overpass 
There were delays on the red line today?? I should have purposely gotten stuck in them so I could complain 
There were ground rules established. No one said anything about not using outside sources....
There were just so many world series wins
There were maybe like 40-50 people throughout the night 
There were multiple times that the realtor showed up unannounced with a group and I made sure to point out, in front of the group he was showing to, that we were not given notice. There was one group that was mortified and apologized to us on behalf of the realtor
There were some where we walked into the room and there was absolutely nothing that could be recognized as a clue, and some others where your task was obvious and you knew exactly what to do 
There were/are always wipes in the bathrooms at my house but have not followed that practice since college/moving out
There will be a wedding party breakfast that you will be attending in the morning
There will be an hour long segment where the band will just read messages from the bots, but only Zo RSVPed yes.
There will be avocado 
There will be buns 
There will be no keltics on the room but I can throw espn3 on the tv in my apartment 
There will never be a shortage of pre pubescent little fuckers talking about fucking your mom. Therefore they can always rely on people to buy call of duty games 
There will never be anyone like him
There will never not be people getting breast cancer. You can do tons of reconstructions on 50/60 year old post-menopausal women 
There would need to be a criminal lawsuit for that to happen. I believe everything has been civil thus far (did not open the link you sent) 
There would probably be more ham. And rum. Maybe even rum ham. 
There ya go, giving Mahomes the ball to end the game again 
There you go
There you go goody. Naked 
There you go Kevin 
There you go Ryan 
there*
There, now Lyme disease is a joke 
There. Big yikes 
There. Fuck you joe 
There’s a restaurant there called True Food Kitchen that I enjoyed, but maybe only because their gluten free stuff was good 
There’s my good friend Goody 
There’s no bobsled in the summer Olympics, Kovin 
There’s no fish in Cleveland 
There’s no regular season championship in nfl so I don’t think the comparison is directly applicable 
There’s no way for you to read all of those messages and come up with any conclusion other than Darrow is innocent, Joe is a lying sack of poop, and Marcus is a simple minded fool who enjoys feed on said lying sack of poop 
Therefore
Therefore any golf power rankings are incomplete and invalid 
Therefore he can't even claim "unbeatable except for me"
Therefore he is not my fellow medical trainer 
Therefore I exceeded your budget in a joking fashion 
Therefore I'm just going to bitch out and not give an opinion 
Therefore ironic 
Therefore it was an awful algorithm that would not have achieved its intended purpose
Therefore, I prefer Linsanity 
There's a Burger King if you want fast food. A bunch of bars, Loco, Capo, Lincoln, and a few others if you want real food 
There's a connecting flight in Costa Rica for the gulag members 
There's a drug company in Boston that is linked to the stories and just saw something about a South Korean company paying Cohen and now is the front runner to get part of a Pentagon contract 
There's a few in Vermont, been to two of them. Actually chipotle is breaking into their market. Used to only be Moe's up there 
There's a good cock/caucus joke somewhere in there, I just am not skilled enough to find it 
There's a good freakanomics episode on a restaurant group in NYC that has abolished tipping  
There's a joke about you not wearing your helmet somewhere here 
There's a joke in there about Morcus not fitting into the beltway elite, or into his belt. But I am neither clever nor mean enough to come up with it 
There's a law from the 1790s that's says that individuals can't undermine the foreign policy of the current administration. Flynn allegedly was in communication with the Russian government on the day that Obama announced he was levying sanctions on Russia (so while the Obama administration was still in power). Flynn and the Trump administration denied that the conversation between Flynn and Russia was about the sanctions, but there is some pretty strong intelligence evidence to suggest that Flynn basically told the Russians to not worry about the sanctions because Trump would take care of them when in office. He won't get charged on the basis of that really old law, especially with Sessions as AG, but I'm sure he's playing the part of scapegoat and taking the fall for the White House. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong anywhere Jordan
There's a legit remix of I Used to Love H.E.R. and the Ocarina of Time
There's a reason Kovin was always my roommate 
There's a reason why he lives in New York 
There's a reason why you don't make any lists 
There's a secondary process in which you can get matched with residency programs that didn't get matched with a resident 
There's also a difference between "creating new jobs" and bringing in already existing jobs from other areas of the country. You are bringing new jobs to New York, but taking them from elsewhere. Doesn't give any local residents any additional opportunity 
There's an argument to make that Linda Holliday killed BB's career 
There's an obese older woman sitting next to me on the train who is reading an "adult novel." I feel uncomfortable. All I see is the words "cock against cock, hard thighs against hard thighs"
There's definitely room for a half pipe in the backyard 
There's just no way to conceptualize a different outcome than a Vikings win 
There's no baton to grab 
There's no hope
There's no Keith Foulke in there
There's no link directly to the gif on the mobile version of imgur. And the search function on groupme sucks 
There's no polygamy emoji. Smh
There's no reason why you would ever need to go out and buy it, but hopefully you can sleep better at night knowing that I am not neglected
There's no team I would rather play in the playoffs 
There's no way I win this week regardless of how he plays lol 
There's nothing hard to understand. There is just a narrative that SOME PEOPLE are trying to push regardless of the @#JustFacts✅ 
There's pictures and video of the woman who got shot circulating twitter. She looks so young. Incredibly sad 
There's something for everyone under the tree
There's the ICA in the seaport too. Another art museum but there's a bunch of places to grab a drink in the seaport that could be fun 
There's the Smith I know 
There's tons of time for Eli to throw a pick 
There's your reason
There's your replay 
These antibodies are artificially made though, so they don't require donation and matching from someone who survived covid 
These are actually #MicroscopeBoiz
These are fire 
These are objectively terrible uniforms 
These are people on a busy, crowded walking path. Most of them are walking in groups of people 
These calls are fucked
These data probably counted John and "almost-30-year-old-intern" Joe Bourque 
These guys got it almost as badly as Drake
These halftime shows are weird af
These I guess are the people who lived their after us - our bar that we left for them is still there
These is one more. More modern 
These last four years have been so crazy that I completely forgot that the Westboro Baptist Church existed
These penalties are getting fucking annoying 
These people should be shipped to North Korea. I doubt anyone will say anything disrespectful there 
These people support skimming, confirmed
These players need to shut the fuck up and make the pick
These refs blow
These reviews suck 
These things. Most breweries sell them and they'll fill them for you with whatever beer you want. I went to a brewery today that told me they don't fill growlers for people. They only pre-fill them and we could only pick from the selection they had pre-filled
These three studies are some of the most widely studied and clearly all show that bias is prevalent in police-involved shootings
These throws are incredible. I think trading Garopo🐐 for 5 first round picks would be a pretty fair trade 
They a free level, a personal level that costs money, and hen a business option. I think there is a set amount of storage for each level, not sure what the price per gig is 
They agreed that that BC head coaching job was better than the OC job at OSU 
THEY ALL HAVE AIDS
They all look 23% disfigured 
They allege that they make their own but I have seen Richardson's trucks outside there all the time 
They already hated you when you wouldn't take shots at the bar with them during your first week 
They also all used to be on Netflix. But to be fair, South Park takes in $80m for that deal 
They also called all BLM protesters terrorists and reposted memes suggesting that American militias shoot protesters for being anti-American. And also said that healthcare workers don't deserve any credit for dealing with COVID because it is a hoax. And also told Olivia's family, right before they got sick, that they were going to come up to Vermont to visit their elderly family members
They also confirmed 82 of Walker's (I assume) judicial appointments in one day
They also found a bunch of really interesting artifacts recently that they are going to display to accurately show Boston's history through and against slavery and apparently that's a bad thing even though it's literally telling history
They also have a hot tub
They also hosted DThomas today
They also just banned a bunch of QAnon folks apparently
They also just traded their best player away instead of working with his agent 
They also lost both Burdos and Moroianu from the bio department after we left. 
They also rammed through 82 appointments across the Wisconsin government to prevent the new governor from being able to appoint his own people
They also said that it was exclusively spread through fomites and not respiratory droplets 
They also took the Pats assistant QB coach
They also use coffee ice cubes in their iced coffee. Not unheard of but it's a nice touch
They also wrote something on Monday about the raiders maybe moving into San Diego. So it's just a giant clusterfuck of different scenarios and no one has a clue what's going to happen 
They always had fruit by the foot and Mrs fields cookies at their house, though. So can't hate them that much 
They announce that a decision has been made so the lawyers can get to the courthouse
They announced the number that they wanted to announce 
They apparently also have it on Wednesday night but not until 9 pm. I know that's too late for Goody but we could do that if that works better for the Fuckholes 
They apparently hosted in 1988. And they hosted the Ryder cup in 1999
They are actually both very similar prices. That whole weekend is much cheaper than if we were to do it a week later in June 
They are all Karens and random parents who don't work in education who clearly do not know what goes on in the schools or what is best for them 
They are all required to self-identify their gender and preferred pronouns.
They are also more likely to pay RVU/productivity based incentives which can be a game changer if you just want to grind 
They are both right. What I said was not supported by the evidence. I believe everything else I said except for that statement, but that statement was what started the whole debate.
They are called peas. Eating your vegetables makes you big and strong 
They are considering an alternate field location. Like with the buffalo game last winter 
They are entertaining and i think views feel like they know what they are talking about, and they learn something new every game. Some statistic or anecdote or fact 
They are giving them time. They kept the fish 
They are gunna be like the Giants and not draft a QB 
They are making us do "Oom roulette" meaning they are putting us in random rooms with random applicants and residents every 20 minutes 
They are moving you to India and will be paying you minimum wage their. Congrats on your 3 rupees a day 
They are not a girl. They are not a man. They are something you will understand.
They are not good enough to give it away 
They are open til midnight, must have changed their hours 
They are protesting because they are unemployed, professional protestors 
They are proven to be significantly inferior to medical-grade masks
They are redoing the inbounds play because the clock operator started the clock before the ball was touched. We have another chance! 
They are rerunning the sample with a more accurate test and then also collecting a new sample 
They are selling "detox" regimens and "vitamin drips". Certainly not research based services 
They are selling part of their company 
They are theoretically cross contaminated 
They are trying to cover every possible drama topic in possible in these hour long episodes. It is not fun.
They are who we thought they were, and we let them off the hook
They are. They have an office here too. The New York location might just be a second office 
They aren't as reliable as will fuller or Allen hurns 
They aren't Bocker's residents. They belong to the whole residency. There is no concentration of wealth 
They aren't even a New England-only chain
They aren't in GroupMe so they don't count
They aren't meant for you
They aren't racist in the way that Marcus thinks the Trump ad wasn't racist
They argued some sort of exemption that didn't exist in the cba and got fucked sideways by an arbitrator 
They bailed out AIG, why not me?
They best the team that beat both Alabama and Georgia. 
They better not be fucking calling DPI on the browns 
They booed him two nights ago too 
They both have 0 targets, in case you're all wondering 
They bring all these dipshits into professional sports when real athletes like Gordon Callender are looked over
They called me Sunday night to thank me for donating annually and to ask me to give them more money.
They came in the league in 2002, after Brady took over. Therefore, I'm going to guess never 
They can hang out with us. Jordan won't be there to swindle your brother
They can’t handle a 4 man rush and definitely can’t handle the blitz 
They cancelled his and pence's outdoor speeches because no one showed up 
They cancelled the last week of my surgery Clerkship and the oral exam 
They can't even recognize who the punter vs qb is. 
They can't even report about a quality tv show. 
They can't find a player who isn't antisemitic who has played more recently than 2 years ago? 
They can't let him come back after this season, right? 
They can't lose. I already booked it 
They can't take your money if you don't pay them
They can't tear down the plex until they tear down Edmonds (after this year) because they are putting the new plex where Edmonds is 
They can't turn the Internet back on today because "it's not normal business hours" despite Olivia's dad calling them Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday during normal business hours and the fuck up is on their end
They care about actively making it worse 
They certainly do 
They charge for a lot of their programs. They don't charge for this one 
They clearly are not interchangable
They closed select restaurants before the weekend right before that
They compared him to Edelman earlier. Edelman wouldn't be a bitch and drop that 
They cost a fortune, you have to sit through a billion previews, your experience depends on how respectful 100 other people in the theater are, you better not go hungry/thirst or you're gunna be poor, and if you have to get up to go to the bathroom, you can't just pause the movie 
They could be doing such a better job 
They could solve this issue by just paying players for playing
They damaged my peace of mind
They definitely can get dry pretty easily
They definitely go back to being called the titoons though 
They did a 43 yard kicking competition in Chicago this week and 0 out of 100+ people made it 
They did have that 
They did holi on stokes this year if I remember correctly 
They did it to themselves. Fuck them 
They did it wrong, they're supposed to take a picture at the end 
They did not lose points. It was not a turnover. Opportunity cost is a business term. Sports are life.
They did talk about both on their Twitter show today 
They did that to me. They also texted me last week
They did what I started to do and searched for Mikayla Alamogordo, probably
They didn't call time, I thought they took the delay of game?
They didn't even play a replay on live TV. 
They didn't even work this October. Freeloaders
They didn't offer me a job. Fuck the whole state
They didn't offer me an interview 
They didn't spend it. They financed the money. It's basically free 
They didn't think you minded missing a fake sport game
They do a whole press conference and take your picture with a large check 
They do have interviews with the reporters that break a lot of big stories though, so it's pretty cool to hear what they did to gather the research for their stories. It keeps me informed, but I just wish there was more on other news topics 
They do have the better recruiting class
They do indeed 
They do sell a hard seltzer (their only gluten free beverage besides water) and for about a year, their only flavor was “tutti fruity.” Literally disgusting. I can’t believe @Attorney at Lard and I had to deal with that 
They do sell it. That's taken from their website 
They do, and I need to get on my school's plan in May when I turn 26....
They don't call it "chair force" for nothing 
They don't even have targets! 
They don't even have the Foxtrots backing them up
They don't get how hard the randomizer is 
They don't have a cent in cap space to sign him 
They don't have a GM but they do have a director of player personnel named Nick Caserio. My impression is that BB identifies the guys he wants and what he's will to give up and Nick negotiates 
THEY DONT HAVE RECEIVERS STOP FUCKING LETTING THEM THROW 
They don't have this dude to distract the rest of the defense. They may have a shot 
They don't have tv's there too hipster for that 
They don't hold a candle to the Pats fan circlejerkers in here like #JustFacts✅ 
They don't know your names because they don't talk to you. They don't talk to you because they don't know your names. Talk about a catch-22. How ever will we fix such a difficult situation? 
They don't let me moonlight more than twice a week. They're actively trying to #StopTheGrind
They don't post in the GroupMe anymore so they don't count
THEY DON'T SOUND ANYTHING ALIKE
They don't stay gone 
They don't stock any of the produce. I've gone in and they've not had sweet potatoes at least three times. Also never have zucchini or cilantro stocked 
They don't tell you what the multiplier is. They just show you the higher price and say it's higher than normal. 
They ended the competition before I arrived and refused to allow me to vote. The competition is invalid 
They fixed it after the residents and nurses had a protest in the main lobby of the hospital
They forgot about special teams 
They found it in his spine when it came back, but it sounded like that was improving with chemo. I guess he was admitted for a tune up back in December. I guess on 1/19, he went back to the hospital expecting the same thing but found metastases in his lungs and elsewhere 
They found out the cancer came back a month after his son was born 
They fucked up. 
They Galaxy brained themselves 
They gave me the pair that fucked up, my knee so I will never go back 
They get enough penalties as it is
They get him for 1 year on a rookie deal and flip him for a better pick than they traded him for. They open up the offense for Patterson's speed and saves $8mil+
They get paid a lot, from what I’ve been told 
They go on to score about 5 seconds later 
They got four picks for the lot 
They got it right once
They had a great game. But they lost. So they go on the 🐩 list 
They had a low initial infection rate but they are doing spot testing when there is an exposure, not testing proactively on a scheduled basis
They had a table "at" the involvement fair but their table was by Mac because they weren't a real organization. I put my name on the list there. They basically sent me nonstop emails and texts asking me to meet with their recruitment guy. I finally did and he was a douche. I tried to ghost them because I was too nervous to tell them no straight up so they kept contacting me every other day into February of second semester until I finally told them to fuck off
They had a terrible grade last year too IIRC 
They had dank gf cinnamon sugar muffins 
They have a great track record with coaching hires
They have a huge beer hall in Providence with like 20 different beer styles on tap. They definitely take themselves too seriously 
They have a Lone Star in Houston? 
They have a lot of blind faith in Mr. Bourque. 
They have a step before the o line even breaks off of the line 
They have a very high pretest probability. Waiting for definitive tests
They have a volume on par with Maine Med. The knock on their main ED is that there are a lot of complex oncologic and transplant patients. But 50% of your ED rotations are at a Kaiser community site and at a county hospital to supplement 
They have an established process. This isn't the time to change it 
They have black people on their team IIRC. I wouldn't know for sure because I don't see color 
They have fun protests
They have good food 
They have interviewed 2 POC coaches and have an interview with Aaron Glenn set up
They have less than 24 hours of oxygen left before they die
They have like $14m in cap space right now (probably more after cuts happen), but I can see them spending ~$4m
They have menu items that are marked as gluten free but unfortunately are not friendly to us glutards 
They have plums and nectarines, don't see why they wouldn't have peaches too. Also, I had some delicious peaches from Whole Foods last week
They have pretty standard 2% increases. They get paid more for professional development. Need to get their masters within 5 years. Sorry John, I'm not sure of that answer 
They have sculptures carved out of butter
They have the 2 minute warning too 
They have to pay for backup systems and disaster equipment. They have to pay for people to do the billing and coding. They pay advertising costs. 
They haven't been relevant in like three years. Maybe they can have one when they get good again 
They haven't had a pod since this happened so no comment from the heroes 
They hotel we are staying in has a room that is sealed by the NYPD for evidence preservation. There definitely was a murder 
They immediately have to die, right? 
They just bang hookers and get DUIs 
They just came out with a dairy free almond milk line of ice creams but put barely in all of them
They just did. 
They just got blowed up all across the line on that 4th and 1
They just released all eight episodes yesterday 
They just said he was sitting because of a coaches decision. Not injured 
They just scored on my stream 
They just sell coffee. Dunkin can already do that
They just tried to start two chants. Didn't do too well 
They keep saying that the Chiefs player let go of Tom. Don't they know that Tom is just elusive as fuck?
They keep saying that we have Drake Maye next year but I'm not understanding why they aren't saying that we have Milton
They keep showing #89 on the Titans. Did he fumble?
They kept him because he cried at a press conference so obviously he cares about the team 
They knew what they were doing
They laid off a shit ton of people recently, didn’t they? 
They let him interact with children like that? Those poor kids...
They literally bought it from someone. Didn't even have the balls to make it themselves 
They literally just opened an engineering school 
They literally just said that these two things exist and didn't explain them at all 
They literally stole this exactly from a South Park episode
They lived in Vandy 603
They looked at other nights but I am still in Bar Harbor so it would have been a nightmare, even if she got tickets for a different night 
They looked so fucking good 
They made it specifically to exclude @Marcus Bauer and me
They made registration for every class on the same day and turned it into a raffle system 
They made their beds and now they must lie in them. Also I feel like John 100% embraces it, so I do not feel bad for him.
They main thing that loses hospitals money is under-reimbursement from insurance companies and Medicare
They make a lot of money but not at the top 
They make fun of gluten-avoiding people within like 3 minutes of the movie 
They marched from the Southe End, through Chinatown, to the state house
They may be counting the super bowl vs the bears and the super bowl that Bledsoe lost to the packers. Those were before we became a real organization 
They might hold him on the active roster so he can play later in the playoffs if he's better 
They missed an illegal block in the back on that recovery
They must have chosen their most competent intern to start on the hardest rotation 
They named their other son TJ Watt. What fucking douchebags
They need a GM app
They need an engineering school to get a higher rank 
They need their half caff no sugar double pump vanilla ice lattes with unsweetened almond milk with a chocolate syrup drizzle and cinnamon mocha dusting 
They need to arrange these football games so we never have a pause in between games 
They need to open up the ballot to more than 10 choices per ballot. You should be able to choose as many as you'd like. It should be "are you a hall of famer" or not. 
They need to seriously fuck off talking about "only one serious injury" 
They need to take Jordan Richards out of coverage and have Butler come in to replace him. 
They normally give the 8 people groups the table in the back, which fits up to 10, but I will totally give them a call when they open later 
They now join my second favorite, Ground Breaker Brewing, as dedicated gf breweries from the west coast to sell east 
They of course haven't worked. Have you seen that man? 
They only scored twice on us in the second half? What a bunch of fucking scrubs. 
They played either our commencement ball or at the next year's ball
They probably coordinated through work emails 
They probably feel really good that you're giving it to them 
They probably got along really well 
They probably had the same book about how to win a debate 
They probably have a shit ton of cops around the highways there after games and concerts to just for that reason
They probably have better steaks than NM 
They probably have their pronouns on their badge reel 
They probably have unlimited funds after stealing money from the elderly and infirmed 
They probably haven't released the polls because the DNC hasn't nominated Seth Moulton yet 
They probably spent millions to have a backup sponsor their insurance 
They pulled the classic BB move to let players test the market only to come crawling back when they find out that BB knows their value better than anyone else
They pushed 1000 pound concrete barrels out of a uhaul and attached themselves to them in the middle of 93n rush hour traffic 
They put me on ketamine to set my bones 
They put out an episode of 1 am est last night. They heard my criticism 
They ran a computer algorithm to determine who would get vaccinated. The results ended up offering the vaccine to hospital administrators and senior physicians working from home and not frontline workers. Only 7 of Stanford's 1,300 residents and fellows were offered a vaccine in the first round.
They ran that formation twice the last time they were at the goal line 
They ran the ball on first down a lot. Averaged .5 yards before contact. No reason to even run the ball at all. Run some quick screens or wheel routes out of the backfield. 
They really fucking draw this thing out
They really gutta call fouls here? 
They really thrust the jerk forward
They recruited me to the point of stalking freshman year. I was getting Facebook messages and texts from a ton of different people all trying to get me to join. I made the mistake of giving them my name and number during the involvement fair 
They reference the ceremony they gave Jerry York at the first home game after breaking the wins record. They made a video to play before the game in his honor, and Leahy didn't make an appearance to congratulate York. And Leahy also wasn't seen at the game to congratulate in person. So how can a figure who never shows his face at sports be committed to their success
They remembered 
They ruled that his momentum was stopped and decided to roll the clock
They said Boston College!
They said he's fine 
They sat us. Just say you're the party of 8 for Jeff 
They saw a picture of Morcus
They saw enough in that other running back whose name I am not even going to try to pronounce 
They say that it was just a problem with the algorithm but we all know what happened
They scored too fast
They sell schilling in Boston 
They sent an email out saying "don't take what isn't yours" 
They should be relegated to a fake league like college 
They should have just lived in posner 
They should have signed Kaep. Would have been at least 5 qbs better
They should let someone try to luck into a homerun 
They should make an app to murder Joe from your smartphone 
They should only mandate writing "thoughts." Including the phrase "and prayers" implies a connection between church and state. 
They should rehire Gregg Williams 
They should trade for Russell Wilson
They sound nothing alike you fool 
They speak for themselves. 
They spelled Mac Jones wrong
They splinted the knee 
They started popping up last night 
They still are. They still are doing that stupid shit like leaving posters up that say "the university doesn't allow this flyer" or shit like that 
They still hadn't constructed the field that the hall of fame game was supposed to be played on tonight. They basically put the field together in 24 hours and it was so shitty that they had to cancel the game 
They still haven't signed the contact for the fight. Maybe it won't ever happen..
They submitted the data a month or so ago. Those applications are hundreds and hundreds of pages. They have to be read, the data have to be scrutinized, and any questions/concerns need to be addressed by Pfizer before official review 
They switched the name associated with each account, but not their nicknames. Kevin is in medical school. Why would he be asking for a raise from his company 
They tailed two suits for me. Was quite happy. They were pretty fast and I don’t remember them being too expensive
They think he has he best golf courses 
They think the mountains and high altitude provide them with superiority
They told me that they really like me and want to bring me in for an in person interview
They told me to take tomorrow off just like a normal post call day 
They tout it as a "Netflix original" because they produced season 4. Why do you remove episodes from your "original" series?!
They traded away Alex smith, their entire defense retired, and their coach jump shipped when it was clear that the team was tanking 
They treat me worse than OJ treats his waiters 
They treated a lot of mildly symptomatic patients in the hospital instead of at home, not enough space for people who needed the care
They use the excuse that part of lottery profits are returned back to communities. By buying lottery tickets, you are reinvesting in your state and schools and community programs 
They used mustard as an example but who the fuck puts mustard in a grilled cheese?
They used the hashtag #stolehisjersey. No one lies on the internet 
They used to have Shane vereen' brother but I think they cut him this year 
They warned the teams to not start shit before the game. They have called it tight and thrown flags for any chippiness. I think it was consistent with some of the other flags three threw 
They went on to school a touchdown that drive 
They went so badly that I am actually fired from my current job 
They were 
They were 13-2 in OOC play 
They were a stove monument supposed to survive a potential apocalypse that contained instructions on how to rebuild society after doomsday. The instructions were written in a bunch of different languages. A bunch of cult nuts thought the stones have special powers so a bunch of other nuts have been calling for them to be destroyed for a while now. I guess someone detonated a homemade explosive and damaged them, so crews came in and leveled the rest
They were active for literally five years 
They were almost relegated last year. They're essentially the equivalent of a minor league team 
They were both your answers 
They were decent, nothing spectacular and nothing in a really really good area of the cape. One was in welfleet which is a great area but it's far away if you are just spending a night there. One was in Bourne which is barely even the cape. I forget where the others were 
They were formed after Brady came to power 
They were good until they went 2-14 in conference 
They were in an Uber stuck behind Kamala's motorcade 
They were much more attractive than most of the weird tufts kids that walk past my street 
They were my number one in high school and I didn't even think they would be considered to be ranked higher than bc 
They were not the answer so I assume no 
They were pretty much all repeats 
They were ranked at some point in the season 
They were reading Stork's head bob and jumping the snap on every down. Brady couldn't change the snap count with the noise. And it didn't help that the pats ran the play clock down to under 4 seconds on every play. It makes it really predictable. One of the reasons think this game is very different in foxboro 
They were really about to call that incomplete? 
They were set to get the first overall pick and then ended up winning in week 18 when Lovey Smith was already rumored to be fired. This lost them the #1 overall pick. If you believe the reporting, the Texans only liked Bryce Young, who is likely going to go first overall. They could have drafted him if they didn't win in week 18. They were going to trade up from #2 to #1 in the off season but apparently dragged their feet and then the Panthers offered more than them and the Texans were SooL
They were still in field goal range 
They were too busy learning to play every chapter of trapped in the closet 
They weren't the only ones. And we we're only down 4 runs 
They will address the Gregg issue shortly
They will be. My understanding is that vaccine distribution has not yet reached retail but the plan is to include walgreens and cvs in the roll out to the public 
They will come back if you let them go
They will have 12 next year
They will if TBC buys it from them 
They will include all content for a nominal fee of $20 per update
They will never make the tournament in my lifetime. I have accepted that as fact 
They will somehow end up losing the next four years of 1st round picks in this scenario
They won yesterday so maybe the "fans" who can afford opening day tickets will forget about them being bad
They won't be able to invade with 2nd Lt. Jordances with Wolves Kelleher on the case
They won't die if they have a positive TB12 attitude 
They would both work 100% if they start at 8 pm. I could do 7 pm either day as well, but I would have to juggle things around if we did that on the 9th
They would have been fine to open the game to spectators at 2 pm. Everyone knows a good riot doesn't start until 10 pm at the earliest. It's science 
They would have won if they engaged eight

They’re 1-8 and the Chiefs have a good offense. I can believe it 
They’re all focusing on taunting calls
They’re not over valued. You said yourself that touchdown points only affected the outcome of two games in 2 years 
They’re saying because he took an extra step, he was a runner, so it doesn’t matter if he loses possession while going to the ground 
They’re trying to undermine Bo
They'd probably just the chlamydia 
They'll also try and extend Harmon and Ryan 
They'll be broken like the Ners this year 
They'll be cleaning the semen off their teleprompters for months  
They'll be in and out of the house. We've had larger groups over in the past (one time we had 12 or 13 people over) and they kind of just work around us being there. They've been known to play play drinking games with us 
They'll definitely suck once the Celtics sign KD
They'll have to admit that toilet to a psych ward due to the trauma that Bock will inflict upon it
They'll probably get the Justin Turner treatment 
They'll probably have you be like Doug on scrubs and only work with the already dead people 
They'll probably raise the cost of beer again too
They're a competitor. I operate fitness with Joff 
They're a lot cooler than I am
They're all in one day, but technically I did 6 interviews for my current job 
They're all the same
They're already out John
They're arguing for more rights for university employees. "The administration owes us justice". No I'm pretty sure you just signed a contract for a job that doesn't pay well 
They're both in the nfc dumbass
They're definitely not too tart, just not as good as strawberries 
They're down by 1 point with 30 minutes left in the game....
They're down by 14 now. 9 left in the 3rd
They're even lazier than you, which is hard to do
They're following a team that loses like 60-0 every week 
They're fucking morons 
They're going the wrong way!
They're growers, not show-ers
They're gunna do everything they can to make me lose
They're halfway to Barcelona already 
They're ignoring it because bocker and Marcus already knew 
They're just hating on me because I'm actually #6 in the GPI and they feel guilty for cheating their way through the season. This whole thing was RIGGED 
They're lame
They're literally the worst
They're married 
They're mostly a lot heavier and conservatively clothed than I expected 
They're nearly identical 
They're no Belmont men's basketball, but they're up there
They're no Dr. Jeff Darrow 
They're offense hasn't looked great 
They're playing as well as melrose high in the annual thanksgiving day game 
They're pre filled selection only included like 1/8th of their varieties (and not their gluten free beer). Only reason it confused me 
They're really making me sweat this one out 
They're rushing 6. Someone should be open. 
They're still going there, just renting instead of owning the land 
They're testing his ACL and not even waiting til he gets to the sideline to do it
They're the same cookie, just called different things depending on where you live. Massachusetts labels them as caramel delights 
They're tied*. What's all of the anger for @Channe Frank
They're trying to make money. That's it 
They're trying to take him down with the Madden curse. 
Theyre*

They've been broken for like 2 weeks
They've been talking about splitting his career in half for a few years now. Hadn't thought about splitting into thirds but good thought experiment
They've been trialing this for the last like 5 years. They add more Sundays every year 
They've got to be all in on Romo then 
They've had an open house almost every weekend since January. You can't imagine how inconvenient that is. Plus private showings
They've had to work too hard today. Cam throwing really hurting our chances to pull this game out
They've won three super bowls and been to two more since I've known you. Your life must suck 
Thicc six*
Thin mints are trash 
Thing* 
Things are getting hot and heavy over here
Things I learned: she is a senior at tufts. She is on the ballroom dancing team. She names all of her Pokemon after her favorite dancers. She's played almost every game twice 
Things I’ve never heard for $1000, Trebeck
Things that have occurred during recent political talk:
Things that this pandemic should change: 1) greater emphasis on healthcare options that are not tied to employers. 2) WFH is an option for a lot of industries that have previously relief on cubicles and officers. 3) Business attire is completely overrated and everyone should just wear what is comfortable
Things would be different if goody and Becker were co-commissioners. Not better...but different...
Think about how rich you could be
Think about it goody. You could probably drink more vodka water then he could. So who is actually more successful?
Think about the personnel that BB left for this team. Clearly no talent
Think about the sacrifices that Jeremy has made to keep you safe. And this is how you thank him?
Think about, do you really want to have something on common with becker about which you can both talk? 
Think it matters*
Think of all the jobs McVay got for people before everyone realized he isn't the next coming of Clipboard Jesus
Think of all the movie channels he gets with his premium cable package 
Think of all the small businesses we could keep afloat for the amount of a single insurance company bailout 🤔
Think of how much he got paid to tell us exactly what the country knew before the investigation!
Think of how upset Saban would be right now if he was our coach. 
Think of it as an analogous measurement to the amount of pressure currently being exerted by your external anal sphincter.
Think of the shitstorm that would cause
Think of what Goody could have became if he had the services available at a men's resource center
Think we lose in the second round of the NIT, despite being the #1 seed? 
Think you guys have smoked them?
Thinking about which intern he's going to bang next 
Thinking back to my work at MGH, I would have been totally fine being WFH for 3 days a week. I would frequently go days without having an interaction with another human being
Thinking Cup? 
Thinking doggy is a slutty position? Denounce 
Thinking out loud: how does the decline of daily fantasy contribute to the decline in NFL ratings 
Thinking that I am psychologically healthy is actually psychologically unhealthy 
Thinking that Jets will take an OL, and Wash may take Levis or an EDGE, hoping Gonzalez or JSN will still be there 
Third best sword in video games
Third Fuckhole to reject an offer from Northwestern 
Third, no one in the league knew that he would go straight to free agency, including me. I was under the impression that he would have to go through another waiver period. Kevin has more waiver dollars than me, so I expected that if this was the case, Kevin would outbid me. However, to everyone's surprise, he did not go to waivers. But that doesn't make it my fault or Ryan's. That's on the entire Fuckholes league for not changing or knowing that rule (if it's even possible to change it). Since Ryan announced his dropping of tannehill in the groupme, to which everyone has access, others had the chance to pick him up too.

This all counts as one post in the post count, right?
This also isn't a place for @Marcus Bauer 
This analysis is gunna be totally wrong probably, but Mitchy's HR was on the first pitch of his at bat which had me thinking. Against the Yankees and Astros, I remember the announcers talking about how the Sox hitters were having success in the playoffs going after the first pitches in the at bats during those series. Doesn't seem like the Sox are being as aggressive or being as successful going after the first pitch until that at bat.
This Andy Reid and MaBitch commercial is so bad
This bar is making me watch basketball

This game is a tease 
This game is a very good mid major matchup. My brother used to have season tickets
This game is bad and I should feel bad for watching it 
This game is bonkers
This game is boring AF
This game is boring. I'd rather watch Bears-Jags
This game is fun because it has lots of scoring. All games should be like this 
This game is going to be sixty minutes of some of the worst quarterbacking in the NFL. Shoot me now. 
This game is infinitely more enjoyable than either of the playoff games 
This game is literally horrible. Crowd was even booing for that call

This groupme already has a team to support. Just check out the avatar 
This GroupMe has become @Chank Hill's Twitter feed. I think that he is stanning for Elon 
This groupme has been 75% shit talking the past two days. Love it. 
This GroupMe has devolved into chaos. We need our hero back 
This GroupMe has gone downhill since I started 3rd year 
This groupme is for shit talk and I fucking hate all of you 
This GroupMe is more dead than Tua's chances of going #1 overall 
This GroupMe is really good about holding fuckholes to their sports-related claims 
This GroupMe is so unlit
This GroupMe is solely for @Chank Hill and @Kelleher I, Prince of Monaco's timelines 
This groupme isn't all about you goody. Some of us just come here to talk to Marcus 
This groupme needs more fantasy football shit talk
This GroupMe only wants to talk about golf and the use of Latinx
This groupme says some fucked up shit but I don't think we can keep someone that supports rape 
This GroupMe should follow suit with a lot of reddit and ban all X/Twitter posts 
This GroupMe straight up sucks
This GroupMe used to be a private forum for discussion and intellectual conversation. Now we can't speak freely for threat of Bock Boi tattling on us. For shame
This gunna be a great story when Minshew leads Jags to victory (sorry Chan)
This guy always believes 
This guy can't even afford a tv, not to mention cable, and you want him to spend $50 on a fantasy league
This guy definitely believes that the footballs were altered

This has been a very trying week and a half for me 
This has been posted multiple times in this GroupMe, skimmer. 
This has been sent to me at least two dozen times over the last 10 years but never in the GroupMe so this is the first time I’ve truly seen it 
This has been the worst execution of the worst playcalling in a few years.
This has been truly a terrible day for GroupMeing
This has Morcus's hands all over it 
This has nothing to do with feeling good about scoring more points. Once you depress the scores too far, what’s even the point of playing? 
This I know to be true 
This influenced the play and got him a fine. Rex's doesn't seem as egregious as this so I don't think it warrants a fine. But at least a "don't do it again" 
This is #FakeNews, but boy I wish this were true
This is $2000 instead of $600, not on top of. Correct?
This is 100% a fair statement and I completely support bocker 
This is 100% a reaction to ray rice 
This is 100% a rouse for Kovin to collect $5 from everyone
This is 100% true 
This is a 2016 competition. Tebow has been irrelevant ever since the patriots murdered him. All Fitzmagic

This is a hard season for us, Jordan
This is a long game
This is a Marc Sessler fever dream
This is a nice album. 
This is a prime example of why it is never a good idea to form your own opinions
This is a question for Bocker or Kovin. Sorry I can’t help more. 
This is a real pussy move, but not more of a pussy move than promising to do the 6-12-18-24 challenge and then not doing it 
This is a really dumb question but how do you get named speaker or majority leader 
This is a sham. 
This is a similar incident to Damar Hamlen, although the cause is likely different 
This is a spoiler, so feel free to text me the answer. I know what happens with the infinity stones at the end of Infinity War. Does that reverse itself in any way at the end of Endgame? Or is the result permanent

This is definitely because Tugboat locked up the broncos 
This is discrimination and Morcus and I won't stand for it
This is exactly what I would look like in a fight 
This is exactly what the protests are against. You are giving police a pass because a citizen, who wasn't a threat, didn't do enough to not be in eyesight of the cops 
This is exactly why you don't let people tweet from the psych ward
This is false
This is far too much social interaction 
This is fucked up...
This is funnier coming from Tingis Pingis
This is going to be a fiery day for the GroupMe, I can already tell. @Boe Jourque  coming in hot. Trump tweets out the wazoo. Kovin blasting his current employer.
This is going to be a good game. Lock it up. 
This is going to be a good week. 
This is going to be a huge issue across the country in our efforts to achieve herd immunity with vaccination, especially if the people refusing are healthcare professionals, and work in high-risk environments
This is going to be a nail biter Jamie 
This is going to be a stellar offensive showdown... 
This is going to be a very unpopular opinion, but I’m of the believe that a company is going to do everything they can to pay me as little as they can get away with, regardless of my gender. If I’m more talented or have more leverage or am more demanding about my renumeration, I would think I’d command a bigger salary. 
This is going to be life changing 🍑 for @Super Bowl LIX Planning Committee President when the Bills win
This is going to make Bocker so mad. I love it.
"This is good:

This is Goody's fault for mating with the enemy 
This is happening because Jboss hasn't been at these games
This is horrible 
This is how we should have done the goat bracket
This is how you get Celiac 
This is inaccurate. A competent republican in office could have certainly helped the initial roll out 
This is incorrect per my narrative 
This is incredible
This is incredible 
This is incredible 
This is insane that this was a touchdown 
This is it
This is just a small clip of it, she's dumb.
This is just a thought, but maybe the fact that Carolina's offense is 100% CMC on every play makes them slightly too predictable 🤔
This is just depressing
This is just so unbelievable 
This is Kraft admitting that Parcells isn't actually important/popular enough to get voted in through the usual process 
This is like arguing what shape we should sit in on the rug in kindergarten. Once everyone grows up, they realize it never mattered and never will matter 
This is like being forced to watch your year old play football on Sunday morning. You have to watch but it is just so bad
This is like the worst possible I that I could spend my afternoon 
This is likely an ignorant question, as I don't know anything about business and generally an a moron, but is there really that much of a market difference between San Diego and LA? Aren't they only like 2 hours apart? 
This is literally all I have and you want to take it away from me? 
This is literally all I've seen all game 
This is literally how the FDA has run since inception...
This is literally Katie Ledecky's race 
This is literally the best offense in NFL history 
This is literally the least surprising news of the day
This is literally the worst time of year 
This is literally wrong
This is Matt Stafford's cliff game
This is mine now 
This is more cases than were reported across the country from the previous outbreaks 
This is my first season in the league as far as I am concerned
This is my freshman writing professor. I used to think he was normal until this election cycle. 
This is my nightmare
This is my nightmare
This is my nightmare 
This is my nightmare 
This is my nightmare 
This is my Superbowl
This is MY year
This is New Money 
This is not correct 
This is not the path 
This is not true 
This is now a whole family failure
This is now Frankie's favorite picture
This is obviously a clever ploy to get us to hire his colleagues and drum up business for himself. 
This is off topic but basketball is such a different animal. The spectators are literally right up against the court and can literally touch players. The heckling there seems way more close/real/influential that say - with football where the stands are normally higher up and set back from the field
This is one instance where you did not skim
This is Oprah's fault
This is our sophomore year RA Meaghann. She loves hockey, cats, Harry Potter, and finding excuses to come over to our 8 man 
This is our top choice 
This is pathetic. This place should be packed on a Friday night 
This is playing out exactly as I predicted 
This is pretty much exclusively on the dude who hit the football out of Baker's hand 
This is pretty sick. Has a Dump 61 Here shirt, catches The Big Dumper’s 61st homerun. Reveals a Dump 62 Here shirt underneath
This is probably the worst game to introduce to this groupme. I give it a week before someone strangles someone in their sleep 
This is pure gold.
This is quality broadcasting 
This is really happening 
This is ruined for me.
This is slander 
This is sloppy football all around
This is so cool
This is so true. I do hate all of you
This is some of the worst play calling I have ever seen 
This is still non-pandemic talk
This is such a dumb loophole. Belichick exploited it earlier this year 
This is such a Fuckhole conversation. Bocker choosing a side and Goody fighting to the death to make Bocker feel as stupid as possible 
This is such a fun fan experience. Glad Marcus and Joe are enjoying this game 
This is such hypocrisy. If there weren't any golf posts yesterday, Bock would be at my front door demanding the $1000
This is taking longer than certifying the election
This is technically accurate 
This is terrible. A-
This is the argument that Eli Manning isn't a hall of famer
This is the best all around performance from the Pats in a year
This is the best all around performance from the Pats in years
This is the best news I've heard in years
This is the equivalent to the year Marcus "won" the championship. This season never happened. 
This is the Fantasy Fuckholes. Nothing is premature except Goody 
This is the first installment, just missed the first 10 minutes. I think one reason this is so promoted is because it's on ABC and it's been promoted on all the other Disney owned stations (such as ESPN)
This is the first I've missed
This is the Fuckholes. You are always welcome to rehash any argument 
This is the guy that signed Brandon Spikes after he compared the patriots to slavery, expected him to actually try, cut him, watched him ruin his career by getting into an accident and fleeing the scene of the crash, then resigned him. 
This is the guy you prefer over Dovin 
This is the heat we needed in here 
This is the last time I'm ever on your side
This is the meanest thing that's ever been said about me in the GroupMe 
This is the most fake data I've ever seen, and I've seen Florida's Covid data 
This is the most offensive text message that I have ever seen 
This is the most sane thing you've ever said 
This is the nicest thing bocker has ever said to me
This is the only explanation 
This is the only fucking league that matters 
This is the only GroupMe that I recognize
This is the only one I’ve done this week. 
This is the only system for girls proven to work 
This is the only thing in life where I have been considered in the A tier. Don't know if that's sad or incredibly proud
This is the opposite answer to your question
This is the opposite of what Marcus feels like
This is the reason why my ball speed is <175mph
This is the ref's first year, and he is taking s long time to sort out a lot of these penalties
"This is the relevant text in the EUA law: 
With respect to the emergency use of an unapproved product, the Secretary, to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances described in subsection (b)(1), shall, for a person who carries out any activity for which the authorization is issued, establish such conditions on an authorization under this section as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, including the following:
(III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks."
This is the right venue for any and all arguments 
This is the same author who reported that the patriots made the Gatorade too warm 
This is the same country club that is too exclusive for Tom Brady 
This is the second restraining order that I know of. The one Kovin mentioned was the other one 
This is the time to cry and drink yourself to sleep 
This is the vision I have of Bock blowing up a French toilet
This is the way
This is the worst corruption I've seen in the league since Goody wouldn't let me keep Gronk 
This is the worst GroupMe scandal since Bocker unilaterally kicked Dovin out of the GroupMe
This is the worst night in American history
This is the worst scandal in the league since Peyton Manning getting HGH shipped to his wife. And that was the biggest scandal in the league since the Broncos paying their players off the books 
This is the worst tease in the history of the GroupMe. Jamie is never going to shoot his 100
This is tricky. There are just so many! 
This is true
This is true 
This is true 
This is true 
This is true. Goody knew right away 
This is true. Most people don't know that Abe killed himself because the production he was watching was so terrible
This is two years in a row that he has had lower body injuries preventing him from planting and pushing off to throw 
This is underrated
This is unfair. Bill Clinton was supporting UT twice as hard on the golf course the other day 
This is very self explanatory 
This is way worse. You're right 
This is what Biden wanted
This is what everyone is mad at her for 
This is what happened chan. 
This is what happens when a Jesuit school hires a Christian 
This is what happens when you have school choice in higher education smh. Right @Long Hauler 
This is what happens when you hire someone who you view as a friend based on the traits that you value in friendship, and not on professional merits 
This is what happens when you put your trust in someone like Joe 
This is what happens when you strike affirmative action. All the minorities in the GroupMe get left out
This is what happens when you take a vacation during a crisis. Thanks Obama. 
This is what I get for thing to live my life without always being on social media. Sorry for not broadcasting every part of my life 
THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE IN BASKETBALL 
This is what Joe said about Goody's scrum
This is what you do to the people around you 
This is what you raft through towards the end of the section we rafted. They had us jump out of the boats and just float down this section 
This is when he stops moving 
This is when our offense and defense stop playing 
This is when you get shitfaced and bang a bridesmaid 
This is where you stay if you go to Banff
This is who Chan is. You weren't here when he rage quit to Houston and stopped posting
This is why 
This is why "hype" is the biggest farce ever invented. They are hyped because they are gunna be exiting to watch.
This is why @emyrbot was always my friend
This is why Androw Bocker was always my friend 
This is why Anthony Goodwin was always my friend.
This is why Anthony is the most important member of this groupme, next to @Skimmer  (miss you)
This is why baseball isn't a real sport 
This is why basketball sucks 
This is why BoChangles Nix and 🧢ABot are winning
This is why Bocker is better than me at everything 
This is why Bocker was always my friend 
This is why Chan is the second best photoshopped in the GroupMe 
This is why Chan was always my friend
This is why Chan was always my friend 
This is why DT fired Jordan from GS
This is why French people hate American tourists. Marcus goes to Paris and he's conspicuously filming Parisians and then assumes they speak English and tries to talk to them.
This is why Goody is a true commissioner
This is why he could never beat out Pop
This is why hope is a bad thing 
This is why I come to the Fuckholes with all my problems
This is why I don't drink inferior coffee 
This is why I don't want anyone else planning any vacation trip: Olivia's mom booked a rental car from a Hertz that's 45 minutes away from the airport 
This is why I get paid the big bucks 
This is why I hate Gregg Rosenthal. Be a better patriots homer 
This is why I have to overread all of the prelim reads on every scan I order 
This is why I volunteered to keep track of existing bets. But no one wanted my services.
This is why I'm not losing. I have the clear intellectual and strategic advantage. 
This is why Jameson likes @Mustache Man better
This is why Joe was always my friend 
This is why Johnny Dash was always my friend and I always hated @Joey Brackets 
This is why Jordan is my commissioner. He has the real solutions. 
This is why Jordan was always my friend even when he stole my cereal 
This is why Morcus was always my friend 
This is why Morcus was never my friend
This is why the bots are winning 
This is why the GroupMe is not lit
This is why the NFL is the more pure football product
This is why we literally can't have anything nice 
This is why we need a fund of streaming services 
This is why we need typo back
This is why we should have closed our borders years ago
This is why you don't get your hopes up joe 
This is why you don't play Ty Montgomery
This is why you don't read anything from ESPN
This is why you don't trade away the only active HOF
This is why you don't trust a radiologist to give you medical advice 
This is why you get left off of lists
This is why you never ride the MBTA bus.  - https://t.co/8Dq49IyGCu?ssr=true
This is why you shouldn't vote for MVP until the Vegas favorite gets face fucked in the playoffs
This is why you were always my friend after graduation 
This is worse than Katy Perry
This is wrestling! 
This is, by far, the worst part of any calendar year
This isn't Buddy Cianci 
This isn't fair. Joe wake up so I can talk trash
This isn't fun
This isn't good 
This isn't good for someone with an anxiety disorder 
This isn't just preseason. This is April. Like before all the teams are even up to 90 players. Before anyone has been drafted. 
This isn't the time to lust over love lost 
This isn't true. He could have said that he let @Chank Hill down
This Jarmond dude knows Urban Meyer. Urban Meyer probably knows Les Miles. Les Miles doesn't have a job. Les Miles to BC confirmed 
This just examplifies how much you guys hate me. I added the previous person, thus he gets shunned. No one wants me on their sports teams despite me actually having more competitive sports experience than Nock. 
This just got released today, coincidentally
This just shows me that our country is so fucking stupid 
This league has less parity than CFB
This league has never had a legitimate season because every year someone cheats or tanks
This league should have a policy where everyone has to donate a good player to teams decimated by injury. That was, we keep the wealth spread evenly throughout the league.
This Liam Coen shit is pretty wild 
This line was actually good 
This list contains players have have recorded a win, asshole 
This list discriminates against 2QB systems
This list is really doing a disservice to fries by leaving off truffle fries
This loss didn't make me want to jump off the Tobin until right now. Thanks for that, Chan. 
This lost is abysmal
This makes it sound like the Kellehers are participating in some incest
This makes me feel great about myself and my friendships
This makes me so pissed off that the Pats lost to this joke of a coach in the super bowl
This man can't be serious
This man can't respect a retired detective just trying to survive a goddamn pandemic
This man cares about America 
This man does not skim
This man doesn't skim
This man doesn't skim
This man doesn't skim ever
This man has gone too far. He must be stopped. 
This man is a national treasure. That's dedication to TSwift AND economic genius. 
This man is criminally insane
This man is definitely going to lose trials because he skimmed the evidence 
This man is entrusted with the lives of newborns
This man is smart
This man lived with me for 10 months
This man may skim
This man will lead my team to victory. 
This map is like 13 years old and has been reposted on Reddit more times than Morcus can count 
This may be a really dumb question, but when people say that addazio is a "good recruiter", does that just mean he's a better evaluator of talent? Or that he does a good job selling the school to athletes? Or that he does a better job of finding athletes that may not be on other teams' radars?
This may be stupid but has the Patriots Dline ever tried not breaking containment against mobile QBs? 
This mayweather McGregor media tour is the biggest farce I've ever seen 
This means that the Panthers will stay undefeated and the Patriots will take them down in the Super Bowl off of an absurd catch by Hankerson. Winning touchdown to be scored by Iosefa. Book it. 
This message has been deleted
This Miami-Seattle game is a real offensive clinic. 
This might actually be trade rape 
This might be the perfect time in history to invest in a bidet
This morning I've seen 3 posts on Reddit comparing the Maye flip touchdown to Mahomes and now Marc Sessler made the same comparison and I am livid. Drake Maye is better than Mahomes will ever be 
This must be sarcasm 
This must violate some clause in the Goodwin anti-fun theorem 
This narrows it down to one of the skimmers. I believe Jboss was aware that Goody moved so I am betting on @Skimmer or @Baileys, Guinness + Me 
This never would have stood with the likes of the best commissioners in league history: Bocker and Darrow
This new GroupMe would be a whole lot better with bots
"This of it like buying something from Amazon. Amazon lists the product you're buying, but once you buy it, it has to get to you, so UPS or whatever brings it to your door for you to use. 

Amazon=Pirate Bay
UPS=uTorrent/Fuze/etc"
This offense is great. First series I've watched all day. I don't know what you guys are talking about 
This officiating crew is abysmal 
This officiating crew is bad
This on the other hand looks fine 
This one is in Avalon, NJ
This party has used over a roll of toilet paper in two hours. Fucking girls 
This penalty was so fucking shit. 
This performance is bad 
This picture was in fact pre coitus in a bar in Nashville if you must know. Ask Marcus, he asked to watch 
This pitcher blows. Everything inside with zero control 
This professor has zero chill. We just watched at least four videos of athletes dying. Ended the class watch Zach Miller dislocate his knee 
This punt returner for the Buccs has no decisiveness, can't accelerate into his return 
This punter is not good 
This puts a lot of pressure on Bocker. Pass or post a detailed social media apology of how you let yourself, your family, and your Fuckholes down 
This question is 100% out of ignorance, but what determines if a transfer is immediately eligible or has to sit out a year?
This represents the true Patriot way. 
This said “I stand with never”
This season is going to workout so well 
This seems like a perfect GroupMe 
This sends the investigation into a whole new direction 
This should have been sent in the Instagram group
This song is physically making me ill 
This squabble is tearing the GroupMe apart
This take aged so poorly 
This take aged worse than a baby with anti-vax parents 
This team lost before the game even started 
This team really makes me proud of this season
This thing has been very Eli-Manning-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-a-regular-season-game-esq
This Thursday Jordan, all sold out 
This too shall pass 
This trade is looking worse and worse 
This trade is the equivalent of the voluminous diarrhea with which Goody plastered a tree in the non-esplanade esplanade. Twice.
This train has already left the station, becks. No stopping it now. 
This travesty is on par with Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the crucifixion of Jesus. Not even exaggerating here 
This trivia system is rigged!
This truly is a hardship of epic proportions and I really am epitomizing strength and resiliency right now
This tweet aged well
This Twitter thread gives me a full chub 
This type of institutional racism is rampant in this league's administration. The only solution is a complete overhaul of the commissioner and his staff, replacing him with a fair, just, unbiased, unprejudiced leader. Since we don't have one of those, I nominate Darrowball to take over. 
This undoubtedly is the worst trade in history for Marcus. He's taking two currently injured players with uncertain time-frames and paying $30 to give away his WR1. This obviously benefits bocker massively 
This upsets me more than bocker not caring at all 
This used to be a proper fantasy football GroupMe 
This video is at least 10 years old, and you're the 17th person to tag me in it this month
This video is clearly doctored 
This was 100% the right choice 
This was 8-9 years ago. Please come back with conspiracy theories at least from this decade 
This was a hard one. Almost had me 
This was a horrible decision 
This was a report retweeted by patscap. I haven't heard it from any more reputable sources that I would have expected to hear it from. So just praying the source is bad 
This was a whole chapter in your orientation book smh
This was actually the first year that loans were eligible to be forgiven 
This was after he promised to host a webex and then reserved a room for the meeting that "wasn't webex compatible"
This was all made possible by Dovin paving the way
This was almost as devastating  
This was an A- pun and deserves more recognition 
This was back in like 2016/2017 so I choose to believe that he started the movement 
This was correct. I went there at 2, bought 4 pairs for charity. 
This was likely correct 
This was literally what was decided 
This was mean 
This was my warm up. Getting there 
This was not in response to a question and was so long ago in GroupMe time that only an artistic member would remember this one off comment
This was of course after I ordered a CT panscan on him. Good move, right @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD?
This was on the sidebar for recommended videos. Pertinent to topics discussed today
This was partially a joke but I'm glad I was correct 
This was partially wrong. Rhode Island Hospital and Newport Hospital apparently have vascular US techs in house 24/7. Newport Hospital is like a 100 bed facility. The Miriam Hospital has vascular US techs on call during non business hours, in house during business hours. And all three hospitals have regular US techs on 24/8
This was posted last Saturday, but I forgive you for being too distraught because of your love for BC football to read the groupme
This was right after the first week of orientation. I hadn't been yet. joe had his orientation shirt on 
This was supposed to go along with the last message but didn’t post for some reason 
This was terrible for the GroupMe 
This was the first time I’ve lived in a legit neighborhood with kids and I embarrassingly underbought. We ran out of candy by like 715
"This was what I was referring to

https://twitter.com/barstooltweets/status/686009120214781952"
This was with the chief of two Maine Med affiliated community hospitals for a split academic/community job that doesn't exist yet because that's how EM job interviews apparently work 
This wasn't necessary, I was already dead inside 
This wedding is horseshit 
This wedding is in the middle of the woods in an unincorporated town in WV and the 15 mile single lane, unpaved road to get to the event space was lined with confederate flags. It was pretty terrible knowing you all 
This week 
This week has been so slow, I don't even know what day it is anymore. I wish someone would tell me, in meme form, what day today is....
This week is not last week
This week was my first week at 40 hours but my new boss for extra 10 hours flew to Moscow yesterday and has been in contact with no one. I have nothing to do 
This week, hardly any because of their factory issue
This week, the NFL submitted a letter of their own saying that none of those cases are relevant because they all had a neutral arbitrator, and Goodell was not acting as a neutral arbitrator. Which goes back to the point they are making that it doesn't matter if it is fair or not, Goodell can do what he wants because of article 46 of the cba
This week's posa matchup is reminiscent of how many points I lost by each week last year 
This whole "extreme vetting" is a rouse. I'm betting one or two questions and an extra month of waiting get added to the current vetting process and Trump declares it to be a completely new, redefined, more extreme vetting process
This whole country, air travel system, and propensity to say sorry but not actually do anything to fix your problems is fucking ridiculous 
This whole season
This will be fun
This will be the first play Hightower is in this whole drive 
This will be the first time since Joe ran the marathon that I am not working it. I'm actually really bummed 
This will likely continue until their court hearing next Monday, when both Goodell and Brady are required to attend. It will likely be the last case before the judge makes his ruling, which should come before or on September 4th 
This would be a defensible comment IF it meant he snuck his candy in instead
This would be an appropriate time to use said line.
This would be exactly what they wanted 
This would be so much easier if we just had topics
This would be the graphical equivalent of a Deez nutz joke 
This would be the most NFC East thing ever 
This would have been me, too
This would have never happened if Santa brought me a PS5 
This would have never happened if the zoo had the courage to let Harambe kill that kid 
This wouldn't happen if Joe paid for the bots to be in the GroupMe 
This year*
This*
This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get Morcus to read the GroupMe
This. Fucking. Guy. 
This?

Thomas 12:199: Thou who roots for his fantasy team over his home team shall have a micropenis.

Thomas*
Thome?
Thompsons got mixed up no fewer than 12 times at my wedding 
Those 756 people didn't weather the storm. - Goody, probably
Those are all #FuckholeApproved snacks 
Those are all awful. Lobsters, diglett/OTF, crumple/fold all would be better options 
Those are all my burner accounts. My b 
Those are my favorite movies 
Those are really the only companies I would go out of my way to buy but there are a few other companies that make a few pretty good varieties that I may have in a restaurant 
Those are some big onions 
Those are some big onions going for it on 4th down in your own end
Those are the first pictures posted. None of which by Marcus 
Those are the only three house in the cape that are <$400 before fees that say they fit 5. We could get a smaller place and try and cram if people prefer that 
Those are the winds from the Red Storm sweeping America
Those are the worst. 
Those are two quality guesses. 
Those are your electives, so you can rotate through the specialties you want to work in, or you can do away rotations at other hospitals that you want to do your residency at. It's like getting your foot in the door before you interview there, and you can get letters of rec from the doctor supervising you that help out 
Those aren't gluten free brah. Gluten will make your dick fly off. 
Those aren't on my list
Those buccs jerseys though 
Those damn floating tumors 
Those data are*
Those ears are not as cool as the Elsa ears I wanted to buy.
Those environmentalists will do anything to protect the earth 
Those few yards may have made a difference 
Those fucking "others" can get the fuuuuuck out
Those kids have worked hard. They deserve to get drafted or not drafted 
Those kids were never the same 
Those last two were the backup. 
Those meals look just look way too perfect 
"Those of you coming to Stowe, please bring with you:
- an air mattress if you have one
- a pillow, a blanket, and a towel
- bathing suit if you want to have tubby time with goody
- alcohol of your choice and desired quantity (again please no weed or any drugs)
- all your ski stuff
- it would be incredibly helpful if you stopped at the grocery store right after you get off of I-89 in Waterbury, VT and picked up some snacks or something we can make for breakfast (eggs, juice, sausages, etc) as food in Stowe can be expensive so we definitely don't want to eat out for every meal 

The address is 171 Wilkins Lane, Stowe, VT 05672. We'll be leaving Boston around 2:30 on Friday the 17th and expect to be in Stowe by 6 pm, depending on traffic. Feel free to come any time that afternoon."
Those people exclusively went into Ortho 
Those people who were born in New Jersey who pretend to be Vermonters because they grew up in Vermont*
Those questions appear to be much less controversial than I expected 
Those rows are called columns 
Those socks make me physically ill 
Those things are nothing. Not everything. Not included in what I love. 
Those three rupees in India are looking pretty good right now joe 
Those two mountains are awfully close to one another 
Those versions are better 
Those waffles have gluten in them, Marcus. 
Those were the two in Fulton with him? That makes more sense
Those were two of the worst third and 1 and fourth and 1 play calls I have ever seen 
Those who live in Boston-proper, is Comcast still the only cable option? 
Those who score the most points should give their points to those who score the least.
Those wings are crack
Those wins don't matter because people don't set their lineups. Any championship will be meaningless in the eyes of the commissioner 
Thots*
Though I do agree. We need to get true progressives in like Bocker 
Thought for sure that he was going to go to the Saudis 
Thought I saw it live
Thought it was a myth like goody's threesome story and Peyton manning's chances of winning the super bowl 
Thought it was great. Still watch the TV show religiously 
Thought of the flume too, but lonesome lake looks good! 
Thought so too 
Thought the same thing
Thought you couldn’t buy back in after a certain week?
Thought you were in Atlanta with Shelbie 
Thoughts on BC declining to host Uconn at Fenway this upcoming season?
Thoughts on BC scheduling a home and home with Missouri?
Thoughts on recent NCAA football rankings?

Tim Tebow got cut way back. Replaced with Drew Brees, who then retired and was replaced with an A player in the draft. I believe we have won the Super Bowl the last 7 years. I have not, however, turned on my PS3 in like 2 years so it theoretically still exists but I cannot confirm definitively. It's kind of a Schrödinger's cat situation.
Tim Tebow is a minor league baseball player, abc college football analyst, Thanksgiving Day parade host, and commercial star. I think he’s doing just fine. 
Tim Tebow is apparently pursuing a professional baseball career?
Tim tebow was not a number one goat

tl;dr on the issue: the algorithm to determine who would get the vaccine was programmed to likely prioritize prevention of deaths over prevention of infections.

To add an extra layer, Sessions recommended that Trump fire Comey. Sessions recused himself from the Russian investigation. Comey is leading the FBI investigation of the Russian allegations. Kinda seems like Sessions is still influencing the Russian investigation 
To add to my previous comment, within brands, there are different fits that affect how your knee/ankle move. If you get the wrong shoe, you'll fuck up your knee like I did. I run on asics but I would never recommend a brand without you having someone watch you run and make a recommendation off of that. John is referring to Heart Break Hill Running Company. I haven't used them but I recommend Greater Boston Running Company 
To add to the legend
To all of my fellow massholes: sucks to suck
To answer your question, Chan, anyone who potentially commits a crime deserves to be investigated. I'm not too proud to say that, if the allegations of his wife committing fraud are true, that Bernie himself was a hypocritical, imperfect candidate. However, I can still say I agree with some of his policies. He's already lost status in my eyes, as he seems to be, intentionally or otherwise, driving a stake through the Democratic Party. I'm not sure that he was ever a good face for the party, but I believe some of his goals should still be what the party strives to achieve 
To be clear, I am not self-obsessed enough to claim that doctors deserve a spot in a top three, I'm just arguing that Anthony's reasoning for them not being important is dumb.
To be clear, I don’t believe in advertising to doctors either. I believe in prescribing drugs based on their results in clinical and postmarket trials 
To be clear, I like Treven as a person but we were not compatible as roommates. It was not that he ate chips late. It's that he would use the microwave (under my bed) at 3 am to heat up queso for his 3 am chips. He procrastinated his biweekly honors class assignments and would come in after I would go to bed, turn on all the nights, and pull all nighters every Sunday and Wednesday. When I asked him to go to the lounge to study, he would leave for 30 minutes and then come back hoping that I was asleep so he could study in the room. I am not a very light sleeper, but he woke me up almost every night
To be clear, they aren't saying that's wrong. But they're trying to say that it doesn't matter 
To be exact 
To be fair HPV vaccine also plays a huge role in that too 
To be fair the Broncos are as evil as they come though 
To be fair to Bocker, the lady I'm "training" to be my "replacement" emailed me yesterday saying she'd be in first thing this morning. She texted me about 15 minutes ago saying she still hasn't started her way into work 
To be fair to his critics, he was playing the Lions 
To be fair to Joe, I lost Keenan Allen for the season, and Blount for the season (not a major loss), and one or two games for Emmanuel sanders. Other than that, very healthy. Would give Joe a run for his money for that #1 spot 
To be fair to Marcus, he's probably used to pulling something out of his ass considering how frequently you tongue punch his fart box in exchange for him ratting on the Fuck Bock Boi GroupMe. 
To be fair, at least he left to lead his own team instead of bandwagoned with a team that had been to the NBA finals two years in a row 
To be fair, Becker doesn't have a job and isn't applying to grad school. He should have the advantage over everyone in this groupme except Kovin. Be better Kovin. 
To be fair, Betty Crocker only has cake mix
To be fair, breaking his nose on the morning of Shelbie's wedding didn't help
To be fair, Dr. Fauci said weeks ago that he wanted a total lockdown because the infection was going to be bad and now everyone is like wow, we didn't stop this soon enough 
To be fair, espn has been throwing around the word dynasty. But I think they were referring to my buffalo chicken dip. Or darrows balls 
To be fair, goody is a tyrant. Gronk was left to me by a legally binding will
To be fair, Hayward missed a whole season because his "ankle hurt" 
To be fair, he averaged like 12 points a game. 
To be fair, he did invite the whole groupme to sleep in James's apartment in nyc
To be fair, he likes 99% of the posts in here 
To be fair, he was nominated. Winner has not been picked. But vaf happy for him
To be fair, he won by being himself and people liked that
To be fair, him playing is also probably not good for his long term prospects
To be fair, I couldn't eat the pizza so I didn't send you out there. I am exempt from your grudge.
To be fair, I did have Odell too
To be fair, I did include a picture that included our entire team (with me in it), but my boss changed it last night without telling me 
To be fair, I gave some of the better gluten free beer I had to friends who are beer snobs and they thought it could legitimately pass for middle-of-the-pack gluten-containing craft beer
To be fair, I have heard them use the term "stage the furniture" on the actual show which implies that they don't get to keep it. But over valuing their renovations is a shitty move. That's disappointing because it's the only show of that type that I actually can tolerate 
To be fair, I have two more players left to go as well 
To be fair, I really haven't paid attention to the hits Cam has claimed he should have been called his way. I did see the low hit this week and that absolutely should have been a penalty. I only posted that tweet because the dude acts like he NEVER gets calls his way, which he obviously does 
To be fair, I saw at least two ESPN articles saying to pick up Crabtree. That's when Becker should have known to not pick him up. 
To be fair, I think that's a horrible play call 
To be fair, I took it from Twitter and not Reddit 
To be fair, I would blow up Alumni because it's a bad stadium
To be fair, if they were better, they would have had a 67% chance to win 
To be fair, Jordan also got royally fucked after having to take over the last place team the previous year with zero keeper value 
To be fair, kinda your fault that you trusted Joe to give you investing advice 
To be fair, mass DMV spelled my name like that despite me submitting forms with it spelled correctly. Then they tried to charge me for a reprint 
To be fair, Morcus makes me cry every time he talks too
To be fair, Oxy was specifically marketed to doctors by saying that since it was a longer-acting drug, it didn’t produce the same high as other opioids and thus wasn’t as addicting. Obviously that was either ignorant or a lie, but definitely played a role
To be fair, people also get hurt there all the time. 
To be fair, Peyton didn't complete a pass last night. That's pretty rough, even for someone with a noodle arm 
To be fair, producing a vaccine requires a lot more specialized equipment. Every vaccine production facility is pretty much designed and built specifically for that vaccine
To be fair, the As fans are also trash. They couldn't get more than 10k fans there when they were playoff bound 
To be fair, the number of people who ask if eggs are considered dairy makes me think that the majority of Americans don't know anything about food 
To be fair, they can choose to believe (or not believe) in any part of their religion, or religion in general, that they want
To be fair, Trump was also never expected to be president of the US 
To be fair, two of those players probably don't play next week 
To be fair, Watson hasn't actually said that he wants to be traded either. Everything is through various insider reports 
To be fair, we almost lost to the raiders last year 
To be fair, who would want to be my roommate. 
To be fair, your brother didn't ask your medical opinion. I am sure you would have said the same thing that I did 
To be fair. I picked up hurns because my other backup receiver was questionable all week and then was probably not going to play. It was a move out of necessity. 
To be honest, DJ had this tournament won when he married Paulina Gretzky. No chance he wasn't going to win  
To be honest, I actually 100% agree with this 
To be honest, my first look isn’t a rookie right end when I have one pass to win the game 
To be honest, my gripe with them is the amount of money they spend in direct to consumer marketing 
To Becker's point about my point, would you rather be the gun salesman who is racist for not selling guns to a Muslim or the gun salesman who sold guns to someone who killed 50 people 
To Becker's point, I don't really see why BC is expected to do anything in this situation. It's a shitty situation but it's more complex than the author concedes 
To celebrate Emyr's birthday, BC athletics is making history! 
To claim otherwise is to claim that this groupme and its rules don’t matter to you 
To claim that there is no racism in the NFL, immediately after the NFL had to force teams to interview more minorities because systemic issues prevented them from getting jobs they probably deserve, is a bad take. Regardless of the context.
To clarify, I'm on your side. There are a lot of people who think that we should be requiring IDs on everyone who voted. But others think that that's oppressing the people who don't have driver's licenses/have the money to buy a state ID etc
To clarify: busy applying to grad school, not busy actually being in grad school
To combine with another media outlet that loses money 
To cover the seat with toilet paper before you sit 
To defend chan (I can't believe I'm doing this), the groupme messages get forwarded to his phone as texts, so he probably has the groupme muted so he doesn't get each new post twice 
To do the job that we signed up, AND paid money, for*
To father Leahy

To fox 
To goody's point, how do you plan to attract more local fans by playing games at alumni? No one is going to trek out their for a bad game day experience. All I am saying is that by having a game at Fenway, you're more likely to attract more new fans or people who are at least going to be interested in the program. Maybe not many, but more that a game at alumni ever will 
To goody's point, I wouldn't put in the intense effort to become a doctor and the stress of the job if I didn't compensate me well enough to live comfortably and not have to worry about money. But I also didn't become interested in the profession because it has a lucrative salary

To make Toronto even worse, the whole fucking city is bumper to bumper traffic at midnight

To my knowledge, he hasn't brought her to the MFA yet, so no deep dicking had occurred 
To not lose by 40, which I said I was going to do from the start

To piggy back off of Bocker, most of the shutdown is driven by states and governors
To play devil’s advocate to your devil’s advocate, if a drug works well with few side effects, it should be prescribed at the same rate because doctors are educated about it 
To play devil’s advocate, someone else’s smoking habit is costing you tax money, Anthony. 
To play devil's advocate, there are far more players in the NFL, so each player's stardom is diluted by other talent, which makes focusing on teams > players a better strategy for the NFL

To quote Ryan Darrow in response to Ned Devine's: kill me now.

To return the favor, you should go right ahead and lock up Emyr as the winner to our matchup
To score enough to win on a 42 year old Zamboni driver*
To some extent but I've been adapting it for my limiyed "in shapeness" and not going every day 
To steal a defense from goody, who argued against my recommendation to bench manning: Brady still gives you the best chance to win a championship. You start him or prepare to lose 
To that point, maybe we should revisit the value of touchdowns. I don't know why no one has brought that up, but I think they are overvalued 
To the Endowed Department Chair of Asstronomy?

To their credit, ESPN dos a great job steering the conversation away from "this happens all the time at Gillette" to "this happens all the time to the bills in many different stadiums"

Today is my first day of orientation at my new job. I am supposed to sit through a two hour webinar about benefits through my medical school appointment (distinctly different than my health system employment) which is very late starting. They also have my salary listed VERY incorrectly and have listed me as a non-benefits eligible employee. So things are going well
Today is the day that the movers come and take all my worldly possessions, and I have to trust them to not lose anything between now and when we close on June 4th. I'm not stressed, you're stressed.

Tony, I said "not easily attainable," not impossible.
Tony, I understand where your math comes from and I apologize for doubting you 
Tony, you are awake several hours past your normal bedtime. I am worried about you. Are you ok?

Troy Polamolu (spelling?) jumps over the line of scrimmage twice a game, no one bats an eye. Kam Chancellor jumps over the line to block a kick, no objection. Patriots do it four times in two years, which results in zero injuries, leading immediately to owners passing a rule banning jumping over the line of scrimmage.

Tufts football literally invented college football. 
Tufts give its own in-house shelf exam for family medicine. They specifically told us prior to the test that the answers would not be available after the exam was over to preserve fairness for future blocks. Professor forgot to check the box that does not allow exam answers to be viewed. Whole class viewed answers. Whole class got accused of cheating.
Tufts hired Accenture to help them not be racist. Seems a little bit different than Goldman Sachs or butthole consulting
Tufts just built two gender neutral bathrooms in our anatomy lab and those are the first I've seen on campus

"U.S. death toll from coronavirus may be closer to 60,000 due to social distancing, NIAID director says

USA Today (4/9, Keemahill, Mansfield, Pulver, Wu, Zhang) reports NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci “said Thursday the death toll from the coronavirus could be closer to 60,000 Americans, assuming full social distancing, rather than the previously projected 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.” Dr. Fauci said, “The real data are telling us that it is highly likely that we’re having a definite positive effect by this mitigation things that we’re doing – this physical separation – so I believe we are gonna see a downturn in that. And it looks more like the 60,000 than the 100,000 to 200,000.”"

Unionized vs non unionized?
Universal is a much better theme park
Unless Bocker has someone else who is quitting
Unless eliminating keepers altogether is an option, I begrudgingly support your aforementioned proposal 
Unless for some reason bocker owes years of backed taxes and by filling out his tax returns for once, he has to pay $1201 
Unless he bets all his money and loses it 
Unless he just fucked both up 
Unless he sucks now and gets the GM fired immediately 
Unless he watched her insert an IUD in front of him
Unless he’s gay, then ask him how he expects to get any dick 
Unless he's like Goody and would consider that a benefit
Unless he's referring to Morcus putting all his money on the Bills, so if they lose, he can't buy someone a gift 
Unless his little fuck brother TJ Watt makes the NFL 
Unless I can choose Scott Zola
Unless I'm the insufferable try hard, and everyone is just avoiding me 
Unless injuries play into it, I don't see Brady choosing to retire then. I see him playing a year or two somewhere else. And that somewhere will probably have a system that he won't succeed as well in
Unless it goes past 8 pm 
Unless it was posted in a hypothetical GroupMe
Unless its Prince Fielder
Unless it's something urgent that absolutely needs your immediate attention, like a meeting getting moved, there's no reason to ever have a read receipt 
Unless JJ isn't important enough to you to capture your full attention....? 
Unless joe and Jamie close on a condo by then 
Unless Jordan was trying to bait us into: a) shitting on the FDA without reading the article: b) reading the article
Unless she's hot. Then maybe be friends. But she has to be hot enough to overcome the craziness on the hot/crazy scale of the universal hot crazy matrix 
Unless someone trades up
Unless the van is exclusively gluten free, you can count me out (although I wouldn't go even if it was)
Unless there is a different stadium that I don't know of that you're referring to, in which case that's wrong
Unless they are under rookie contract with the team that drafted them 
Unless they benefit me
Unless we see what bathroom she uses in North Carolina 
Unless Wentz does what he does best
Unless you are Wisconsin
Unless you consider Tibet to be a free country, then it's located in both China and Tibet 
Unless you count cooking reality TV like next iron chef 
Unless you didn't even realize this was a Patriots All-Decade team, which is an even worse look for Morcus
Unless you guys want to come to his apartment. He told me to invite anyone 
Unless you match in Westchester
Unless you mean caught up on the GroupMe, then the answer is yes 
Unless you were referring to the fact that unarmed black men get shot for walking down the street, and that's why I wouldn't have the opportunity 
Unless you’re Mufasa 
Unless you're going to market basket, 50% chance 
Unless you're SuperFat
Unless you're there in person. Truly a legendary sports experience 
Unless, you know, tj ward or Bernard pollard hit you and you play for the patriots. Then someone ends up dying.

Unrelated to politics, but the Dolphins placed the transition tag on Olivier Vernon. Now they want to replace him, not pay him the money he's worth, and remove the transition tag so they get compensatory picks if another team signs him. Dey fucked up 
Unrelated to the ethical dilemma but related to the current vaccine development process. Learned in my COVID public health course that normal vaccine development requires the construction of specialized, vaccine-specific factories. They often cost >$500mil and take ~5 years to build under regular construction schedules. Companies are basically repurposing factories from failed vaccine trials in the past to turn them into COVID vaccine factories, which would cut time and cost. There can also be some smaller scale production done at research facilities while the factories are being finished, but expanding to massive-scale development is a big hurdle
Unrelated to UMass but related to gold fever wings. A restaurant near me that makes essentially their whole menu gluten free added their version of gold fever wings to their summer menu. They are incredible. I can only imagine how good the real thing tastes

Unrelated, but my RI house went under contract this morning, just under the wire

Very interesting development that no one cares about. The laws are more complicated, but in simpler terms, physicians needed a specific addendum to their licensure (dubbed the X waiver) to prescribe Suboxone for opioid use disorder. Doctors, for years, have been fighting to remove the requirement for completing the X waiver course to allow all doctors to prescribe Suboxone, especially as the opioid epidemic has gotten worse. The governing body within HHS, SAMHSA, has opposed this over the last 4 years, basically because of lobbying from the assistant secretary. That assistant secretary resigned due to the Capitol riots, and within a week, SAMHSA removed the X waiver requirement for prescribing. Just goes to show how government can stand in the way of policy change that would affect so many people simply because of a single individual.

Voting is a right. Driving is not. 
Vrabel
Vrabel
Vrabel blinked and lost a dawg
Vrabel is obviously awesome but I love the idea of building the coaching staff with an offensive guy who has been successful in unlocking a quarterback with the most similar comps to Maye and has done so without superstar position players
Vrabel*
Vrabes bringing AJB to the Pats is going to be sick 
Vrabes getting dudes on that defense
Vrabes spending all the cash Mayo promised to spend last year
Vrable doing a great job coaching his D to be just like the Pats D

Wade already has three rings and is making bank. I wouldn't give a shit either if I were him 
Wade go the Celtics confirmed 
Wade has a broken ankle. Out the year 
Wade has won championships. Clowney has won playoff games. 
Wade only came in in the fourth quarter and they ran the call a lot 
Wade Phillips is a good defensive coach for someone who looks like he's on the brink of having a stroke 24/7
Wade Phillips might have just died 
Wade?
Waffle, standard, sweet potato
Wahlberg is a horrible representation of Boston. I wish he wasn't associated with us 
Wahlburgers burgers are not that good. Just a normal, overpriced burger 
Waiiiiiiit what was that new rule? You can get a touch back without the ball ever going in the end zone? 
Wait
Wait 
Wait a minute. This does not come anywhere close to the diet choices that Marcus has made recently 
WAIT A MINUTE. What happened to Becker's threat to post NSFW images all yesterday due to Chan spoiling HP for Emyr? 
Wait a minute. You just said the Pats were bad??
Wait a minute..

Wait, @#JustFacts✅ was invited but I wasn't???
Wait, Addazio's play calling near the end of the game wasn't spot on? No fucking way...
Wait, Auburn fired Gene Chizik? Sorry for your loss @Marcus Bauer 
Wait, bocker lost Darrow's dozen last year and he only gets six extra this year to make up for it
Wait, Chan and I both just searched for Kohli, which counts for him in ESPN's metric. Bastards....
Wait, Chan goes to bed later than Bocker and me? So Bocker and I don't go to bed the latest out of people in the Groupme? Sounds like @Wednesday, Inc.  is #JustFalseX (can't do the proper emoji on the computer)
Wait, CP3 got hurt in the playoffs? I'm shocked 
Wait, Darrow, aren't you supposed to be making sure he doesn't run out of water? Some teammate you are 
Wait, did I just say offseason? I meant other teams' offseason. We still playing
Wait, frappe is a Boston thing?
Wait, got that wrong. He was the Sec of State for Kansas and was running for governor
Wait, have you been to Europe before?
Wait, I mean I'm up grinding
Wait, I thought Morcus wasn't running because he was going to be full. Then I thought that he wasn't running because he had to take care of his children. Now he can't run because he is going to hit a little white ball a few dozen times? 
Wait, I thought you weren't supposed to file jointly?
Wait, if Jordan is leaving, who is defending the Capitol on Jan 6th? 
Wait, ignore that. My groupme just glitched the fuck out and showed that you reposted the same tweet as I did
Wait, individual votes don't matter. I forgot
Wait, isn't Miami one of the worst teams in the league 
Wait, Jamie are you having T troubles? 
Wait, Jordan and Becker, who won the bet 
Wait, Marcus and I agree on something? Marcus was ALWAYS my friend 
Wait, pause. Jamie didn't play paintball? And Joe wouldn't drink because he took a Tylenol?
Wait, so how do I get in on that get fit quick scheme? I need to lose a good 20 lbs fast
Wait, that time and location doesn't work for me. Can we move the super bowl party to Friday night and have it at my apartment so it's more convenient for me? 
Wait, that's a lie. The real first thing was to get coffee and gluten free pastries 
Wait, the fantasy season started already? I've been waiting for my invite to the draft
Wait, what day is it? @GeoffFacts 
Wait, why is Becker making roster moves. This should be @Emily Clark 
Wait, wouldn't that mean that the Jets were bad?
Wait, you mean the salad that has dairy and fruit and is covered with balsamic?
Wait, you're posting evidence that you're wrong? Evidence that the rest of us wouldn't care enough to look for? 
Wait. Bar Harbor or Bah Hahbah? 
Wait. But then I can't eat foods with eggs in them 
Wait. Does Hillary use a bathroom that doesn't conform with her gender identity? That means you have to vote for her because she is brave and stunning 
Wait. Goody. Are we teaming up again?!
Wait. Her parents grew up in NJ. They clearly did not get the life skills to raise New Englanders
Wait. I take that back. You reminded me how happy I am to not have to buy a wedding gift, pay for travel and lodging, pay for food, and fake being nice to people.
Wait. Is Erin the mouth or the muscle?

Wait. No, yes, no 
Wait. team #JustFacts*greencheckmark*. John if you’re not checking the GroupMe at least every 20 minutes, lose my number.
WAIT. This is all a clever ruse by Chan to get 11 likes. No one else like the picture 
Wait. Was that commercial saying that you can move your car with your key without being in the car? That's the worst idea I've ever seen 
Wait. Was that to Cooper?
Wait. We didn’t get an updated GPI after last week 
Wait...
Wait.....
Waiting for @#JustFacts✅ to comment 
Waiting for a red zone replay. Then will tell you 
Waiting for all the racist people to die isn't a good strategy? Fuck...

Wake me up when we have the trophy
Wake the FUCK up.
Wakefield high stole a jersey of a black high school football player from Melrose, put it on a scarecrow, and burned it.
Waking up this morning feels different knowing that Katie and Joe broke up 
Waking up to golf and NBA talk in the GroupMe is the worst thing that could possibly happen
Walden pond is a 2.1 mile walk from the concord commuter stop. Sort of hiking?
Walk a marathon 
Walked through poison ivy, so that's gunna be fun in about 12 to 24 hours 
Walker. He ain't a fumbling bitch
"Walking through Harvard, I overhear two students talking:

Wants to move away from JBoss, but moving within an easily traversable distance of Chan. This man has his priorities all screwed up  
War eagle is not even the best live eagle. The best live eagle is the BC eagle that flew away the one time 
Ward just stopped running 
Ware fumbled the ball as he jumped over the pylon and that was ruled a fumble and a touchback (fucking bullshit by the way) 
Ware, Harris, and ward all look banged up. Now Chan, you truly feel our pain 
Warm toilet seats and excessively cold toilet seats are equally bad. Cool enough to not know that anyone else has used it recently is good enough
Warning. Hot take incoming. Prepare yourself 
Warning: about to launch into a fantasy league rules debate.

Warriors = Colts during Peyton Manning era. Regular season records, choke during the postseason. 
Warriors 🐩

Warzone anyone?
Warzone so lit right now
Warzone?
Was a great visit. Expect snow in the good areas until August 
Was also a big fan of CoD4. However, I enjoyed CoD better (really liked the WWII games better than the modern warfare games)
Was also debating trying to convince Olivia to go jetty fishing with me in gloucester, but ain't no way I'm doing that today
Was at that game, chan confirm that it was awesome
Was Bocker a Bills fan ever or am I making that up? 
Was CJ Anderson always this fat? 
Was CoD3 the one that only came out for Xbox? 
Was completely fine for me
Was completely healthy 
Was Donahue fired our senior or junior year?
Was down to $25 from $35 at like half a dozen retailers 
Was ghostbusters in the 80s? 
Was going to ask for a summary. Thank you 
Was going to say the same thing 
Was goody right or was goody right?
Was having an issue getting the GroupMe to load up, but I'm back now
Was having dinner, TV was off. What happened 
Was he at UVA? 
Was he the guy projected to get 54 yards?
Was he wearing Adidas? 
Was he your uncle? 
Was in Vermont the last few days. No shitting to be had yet 
Was it @Idris Elba 
Was it 1998
Was it awkward having to share a room with Angela's photographer? 
Was it in Boston last weekend? I just assumed the people I saw dressed as pilgrims were just going I some weird ass convention 
Was it in San Diego though? 
Was it? It must have been since you had too much Tylenol as a child
Was just about to say that 
Was just going to say, 100% right call
Was just rushed to the hospital 
Was just scrolling Twitter and saw an AP article posted about the NRA filing for bankruptcy. First comment: "This was completely expected. With the distance learning, school shootings are way down."
Was like $7 at CVS 
Was listening to the radio today, cassel has made 70 million in his career 
Was Nash actually right? Literally just said that because both him and amare were on the suns 
Was on a bus with Olivia and her friends for commencement ball. Someone on her bus drank about 2/3rds a handle of watermelon rubi. Didn't know anyone had a strong enough stomach for that 
Was reported last (?) week that someone in one of the contracted J&J manufacturing labs mixed reagents from the J&J vaccine and the AstraZenica vaccine 
Was secretly hoping that chan would've picked Kirk so I could witness this groupme explode 
Was she a dem or a republican 
Was she anything herself before she started dating Mahomes
Was she bad?
Was specifically told to include only publications and awards from pre residency
Was sunny all day in Boston you asshat
Was that a superfat sighting??
Was that back to back to back homers?
Was that Blair Walsh or Colton Lichtenberg amirite?!?!

Was that kick not good??? Am I blind? 
Was that the "we choose the wind" game 
Was that the NEJM one where NEJM asked the authors to provide all their data?
Was that Tom Brady on that sneak? 
Was that your apartment on Kristen's snap/insta (forget which) the other day?
Was the game as lopsided as the final score suggests? 
Was the girl he slept with at least hot? 
Was the notre dame thing that she asked you if she could come in your RV like two days before you left and you guys said no?
Was the robot a tool or was he? 
Was the tight end position right? Or were both the position and player wrong?
Was The very active GroupMe leader invited? 
Was there a leg kick? 
Was there any progress getting Morcus to sign up for a marathon in person yesterday
Was this before or after Darrow decided he was going to ignore his responsibilies as designated driver and follow in the footsteps of the most disgraced member of the GroupMe? 
Was this CS? How was it
Was this his suggestion or another employee? 
Was this like a group jerk session? 
Was this the girl he wouldn't tell us he smashed during senior week
Was this you Chan?
Was trying to get the double chin look too. 
Was trying to squad up with Kovin earlier but spilled my smoothie all over my keyboard. Finally cleaned it up and it was working, but then just stopped. Feels bad man 
Was waiting for the insensitive comment. Was not disappointed 
Was within one yard of the LOS, so it was legal 
Was worth a shot
Was yours always at wild rover too?

Washington Adams Jefferson Madison Monroe Adams Jackson Van Buren Harrison Tyler Polk 
Washington build this country with his bare hands. Lincoln (as the ultimate SJW) freed the slaves. FDR brought the economy out of the shitter. Truman guided us through WWII. Hillary Clinton identifies as a gender nonconformist and is a transsexual. Truly up there with the greatest presidents. 
Washington Commanders. Fucking lame
Washington DC?
Washington needs to act like they've been here before 
Washington or Adams or Jefferson or Madison or monroe 
Washington ranked #5?!?!
Washington state
Wasn’t a deflection, simply just pointing out the hypocrisy in the standards to which I am held 
wasn’t supposed to be a gif 
Wasn't a big fan of season. Season 12 just started, I thought episode 1 was great but the next two were meh at best 
Wasn't a catch 
Wasn't actually asleep, but I will go ahead and lose your number anyway. Fuck you 
Wasn't in the groupme 
Wasn't in the groupme 
Wasn't in the GroupMe 
Wasn't in the GroupMe 
Wasn't in the GroupMe so doesn't count 
Wasn't in the GroupMe, doesn't count
Wasn't invited 
Wasnt it $5?
Wasn't it 27-0?
Wasn't kickoff 3:40? How are they already done a series?!
Wasn't my best idea
Wasn't Sanu supposed to be good at everything? 
Wasn't she on a St E's billboard? 
Wasn't the Cotton Bowl an old BCS bowl?
Wasn't there a clause about a player that someone drafted and released and what their value would be if the player was claimed by another team vs. the same team?
Wasn't watching too closely but that's embarrassing 
Wat
Wat
wat
Wat
Watch a catch 
Watch every damn episode
Watch out @Fantasy Baseball Champion , her pintrest has a board of wedding-related things
Watch out @Two Time, you're only projected to beat me by 35 now 
Watch out for that security warning on excel, goody. Don't want to crash your whole company's IT system like Bocker did at MGH
Watch what you say in the GroupMe, though. There are some people here who like to tear others down for trying to be better/healthier people 
Watch what you say may, in pretty sure jordan is dead 
Watch what you say, Jordan. You work for him.
Watched that drive looking into a Fenway bar from the street, just a few hours before I saw Papi's grand slam to tie the game up against the tigers. 
Watched the first season. Liked it. Haven't seen any of this season 
Watching an interview about the royal family, conducted by oprah? No. I have a penis, so I am not watching
Watching Bailey hurt another team is cathartic 
Watching Darrow doesn't count
Watching football
Watching highlights. Hightower obviously can be a sub-hero in the last two Super Bowls for his marshawn lynch tackle and the strip sack, but how about Alan Branch making the play to recover the lose ball. The ball bounced back towards the Oline. Not a given that Pats recover that 
Watching other teams play really makes me feel lucky to have bill and Tom and rob and Julian.
Watching the Rams HC act like a total little bitch is incredibly embarrassing for him 
Watching the recording of the Pats game. First drive FlaccLOL
Watching without sound
Watching*
Water temple in MM was definitely better, but that could have been because Devon was helping me with it 
Water vaporizes. Not steam 
Watson can appeal the punishment that Goodell gives him but then you end up in the legal system, which as Chan said, may not end well based on past precedent 
Watson to the Pats
WATT SUCKS AND IS OVERRATED 
Way more than that. I think like $800
Way past his bedtime bro
Way past my bedtime 
Way to be a narc
Way to be creative 
Way to conform to gender stereotypes and make Shelbie hold the baby you misogynist cuck 
Way to give up on Melvin Gordon. This was his week. 
Way to ignore @Mr.StealYoGurl you dick 
Way to pad the stats 
Way to remember facts about your friends 
Way to show up for the MFF draft Joseph 
Way to throw your teammates under the bus 
Way too close
Way too many cameos from real golfers. And Travis Kelce. Bad Bunny was excellent though. Still have like 30 minutes left. Olivia dragged me out of the house 
Way too many downfield looks, especially after Amendola got hurt. I thought the chiefs were giving more opportunity for shorter routes, especially crossing patterns or routes out of the backfield. We have three really good pass catching backs, I think it was a mistake to not use them more in the third and fourth quarters when the game was slipping out of our hands and we couldn't gain momentum 
Way too many names to remember. 
Way too much actual golf 
Wayayayay over the LOS 
Wayyyyy overrated 
We 100% voted against it. My point is that it's not a snipe because a popular sports medium who does a similar thing every year literally picked them a week before we did. 
We about to serve you @The Big Dick Bandit 
We actually bid the same amount. I won because you were lower than me in the auction waiver order 
We actually did not send that message out 
We actually have a kid who meets some criteria but ent is resistant to treat for Kawasaki's. Waiting to see how it all pans out 
We actually have social events planned for us every night. Thursday night is potluck night 
We added lots of extra cheese to my broccoli and then I farted on @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 's pillow
We agreed with it at the draft party. Where you wee conspicuously missing 
We all agree that the billionaires on the sub are just faking their own deaths to avoid paying taxes, right?
We all forgot about your Sweden fetish like a week ago
We all fucking noticed 
We all know if you point and shout "our ball" you're almost guaranteed to get the call 
We all know John's opinion of the GroupMe compared to discord. But which communication medium was used for treason and espionage
We all know Kristen is 100% financially supporting bocker, Ricky, and Frank, so it would be a huge loss 
We all know that Bocker wants Morcus here more than anything
We all know that I don't like Elizabeth Warren but one person in Twitter said that she has most of the same views as bernie but can actually articulate real solutions/legislation unlike Bernie who speaks in speculation. So of course that one person in Twitter must be right
We all know that@\dih-KEHM-bay moo-TAHM-boh\  would also concede that point, you know, because he likes saving money.....
We all know that's not true. You cause mass shootings because you voted for Trump
We all know the truth #CrookedGoody
We all know what happens when Bock locks up a game 
We all know what I meant 
We all know who made the best public health youtube video at BC
We all know why Kraft is so cheap
We all know you don't last very long 
We all saw the picture of Morcus, Bocker, and Krosten sitting arm to arm without masks, despite mixing households. He joined that league days ago
We all split rent evenly. @J--Locke 
We all understood. No clarification needed
We all wish that 
We all won because it's over
We all work and still post 
We almost upset Colorado State that one time 
We already decided this year 
We already have the greatest catcher of all time 
We already knew that
We also could just cap keepers at 3 per team, and then you'll have plenty of top players re-entering the draft every year, and you don't have to keep track of how many years you've kept a particular keeper, etc 
We also do not respect you
We also had placed into some track tournament and the AD just forgot to sign the paperwork so we never could go 
We also have 9 picks this year (included picks made and picks remaining)
We also just gave Marcus Cannon a big extension, jordan. 
We also went white water rafting somewhere towards the middle of the country, but I can't remember where exactly 
We apparently are just going to leave the middle of the field open on every play
We apparently missed am AMA?!
We are a 21st century institution.
We are a fantasy football groupme anyway 
We are a four year program so no, I will not be chief next year 
We are a very fair GroupMe. We only heckle those who do something to deserve it 
We are all familiar with him due to his stint with the Pats last year
We are all learning today 
We are all saved 
We are all successful and happy
We are all tied for number 1 because we are #EverToExcel
We are always roommates
We are at 11, so teams of 3-4-4
We are at Ruthie's All Day. I'll be in the back with my hand up when you get here
We are back to the shitty ass cheating chiefs
We are back together
We are both in the same state
We are constantly reminded of this when we see how frequently you post in here
We are currently in a match
We are Emyr
We are ending this at 9:29
We are essentially undefeated right now 
We are far and away the worst country. 
We are flying to  West Virginia for a wedding. We just landed for our layover in DCA. We have 40 minutes before they close the doors on our connecting flight and we are still on the tarmac on our first plane 
We are flying united on the way there though. Chances we don't make it until 2 weeks later? 
We are getting flower pots with pride flags painted on them to put on the front porch 
We are going for a field goal 
We are good again
We are here for 3-4 days so wherever works best for you ❤️
We are here for you
We are here for you, but@The Big Dick Bandit  isn't because he's been asleep for hours
We are in a fight that he doesn't know about until the next time he invites me somewhere and I forget all about it
We are in the middle of a pandemic and I have spent >3 hours of my day both yesterday and today just sitting around while on my infectious disease rotation. It's supposed to be lit 
We are in the same party. This is HUGE
We are mad at the whistle 
We are never leaving GroupMe 
We are not going to Quebec 
We are on the waitlist for three different daycares lol
We are on viruses
We are only on appetizers now. Will keep you updated
We are signed up for 4 pm. I can send the link to anyone who wants it 
We are sitting at 3.2 mil right now. What's Larry Fitz's cap hit?
We are skiing at Bolton today. Mountain is empty and lift tickets were $39. But I suck because I'm fat and my boots no longer fit me right 
We are sympatico 
We are talking about bockers feelings about winning....kid has never stuck with an NFL team for more than 2 seasons
We are talking about real sports, Jordan 
We are the equivalent of the week one cupcake team that every real team schedules 
We are up to 9 patients with verified data, one with unverified, and one who "agreed" that we need to collect on
We are watching the Patriots game, Emyr
We are what we eat 
We are. We are almost there. Just keep waiting
We aren't actually friends
We aren't even in the same state 
We aren't gunna win this week. Don't @ me
We aren't old. They are just too young
We aren't planning to reveal the gender until it can decide for itself. Thinking age 32
We aren't talking about that anymore Kevin 
We ate Chinese food together that one time, @The Big Dick Bandit 
We ate there all freshman year for lunch?! 
We back
We back to the GroupMe being 69% posts from Chan's X feed and 4.20% pictures of Sydney Sweeney 
We boarded our flight, and the captain just announced that he's now over the amount of time he can legally work and they have to fly another captain to fly us. Darrow, how much money did you pay them?! 
We both did Pokemon!
We bought a new mattress for our new house. It started in Arizona, then went straight to Connecticut. We got an email saying that they were moving up delivery to 7/1 and the mattress left Connecticut at 2:30 am, so we thought we might actually get it on 7/1. However it didn’t show up because it ended up in Ohio last night. This morning, it was in Missouri. Tonight, it’s in New Mexico
We briefly considered hiring a nanny until the first one quoted us $62000/yr
We came home Sunday afternoon and he was literally vacuuming under her feet while she sat on the couch, legs resting on the coffee table 
We can add Dovin back. He was a better addition anyway
We can all agree that Edelman deserves to be in, right?
We can all really thank @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD as he was the only one to tell me that the hotel was full 
We can circle back and take this conversation offline. The topic doesn't synergize with the rest of the team
We can circle jerk about how every other team sucks? 
We can discuss later on, but I have a better spot to rent than the mountain itself, @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼. Cheaper for better gear and it's on the only road that goes up to the mountain 
We can get shots together 
We can go with that
We can just work around those two teams.
We can listen to the new serial podcast as we work 
We can name our league "the Washington redskins"
We can now definitively say that BB is more important to the Pats franchise than TB 
We can only hope that Angela appreciates your commitment 
We can pick the same team twice, right? 
We can play Catan after we go lunch on 6/17 at loco taqueria and oyster bar 
We can probably just trade our second rounder for someone else's first, right? I've done this on Madden before
We can see how that went 
We can start with my tendency to avoid talking about awful things by replacing it with humor because it makes me feel slightly better about the awful world we live in
We can still do this. Let’s go 
We can still win
WE CAN STILL WIN
We can talk about Marcus not walking to talk to us again 
We can tell by reading your notes
We can uninvite him if you'd like. Just say the word 
We can work around them, it's fine
We can worry about his long term health when he retires. Right now his job is to run and hit people. 
We can’t all send the same snaps if we’re together though. That goes against your rules 
We cancelled almost all our elective cases again 
We cannot
We can't compete with anyone. We look like an FCS team 
We can't let them see this
We can't prove that he didn't 
We care less about you 
We could add him and no one else and see how long it takes to notice
We could also just get rid of the IR spot altogether. If you want to keep a player, you have to be willing to sacrifice depth on your bench 
We could always ask Marcus. He's definitely seen Bock Boi's peen. Pre and post maritally 
We could always just remove the SATs as a punishment for the last place team for everyone! Our commissioner should hold a vote 
We could always make an Entourage-type show about the groupme 
We could be neighbors 
We could do what Ernie Adams does 
We could get together in a room and document all league rules. Any disagreements result in a head to head game of off the wall. Loser gets pegged with a tennis ball.
We could have camps where we send all people tied to Muslims. Worked wonderfully after Pearl Harbor 
We could have just had a tabula rasa 
We could have traded Pokemon and raided all game. 
We could only be so lucky 
We could use the Fuckhole School of Medicine to create the Fuckhole School of Medicine and Political Takeover 
We could volunteer at a homeless shelter and distribute meals to the underserved
We couldn't do it in stowe, she's working all weekend, but if you guys are actually serious, I'm sure she'd be fine having people over 
We currently have our own vanilla being made with Mexican vanilla beans steeping in vodka. Rich guy move
We definitely should organically tank for Trevor 
We definitely thought the innuendoes were 100 times funnier than they actually are 
We did do that, and then Trump reversed the policy 
We did draft one last year who had a mystery illness and was out all year 
WE DID IT 
We did it guys 
We did it guys! 
We did not pick anything for you in the hopes that you would come back in time to pick 
We did too
We didn't adopt that until after I picked up marshawn 
We didn't need another excuse for the Bar Boiz to legislate more stuff in here
We didn't need the source Becker, we knew it was real because you are@#JustFacts✅ 
We didn't survive. They were murdered in the first minute of the game. We just slowly burried their bodies
We didn't win.
We discussed this eight hours ago 
We do probably have heart disease though. Even trade off I think
We do regulate drinking and smoking. They are banned during the most vulnerable times in people's lives. 
We do this through the end of April, and then start “red block” which is basically a bunch of public health stuff that I’ve already done for my mph. And then we go back to traditional systems blocks in the fall 
We do way more than you and you smell 
We don’t know that because he doesn’t talk to us 
We don’t want you guys on the bandwagon 
We don't bribe recruits with strippers and cars
We don't do syllabus week....
We don't either but yet you still find your way here every day
We don't even keep our late round picks in the WR room. We just bring in a bunch of players cut from other teams and undrafted free agents 
We don't even know if it will show any semblance of seasonality like the flu.
We don't get better mortgage rates
We don't have a diet groupme yet
We don't have a punishment this year
We don't have a tub or any spoons in my apartment. Sorry. 
We don't have a 🐐 list anymore so ...
We don't know that kroston didn't cosign 
WE DONT MATTER TO YOU????
We don't need more GroupMe members. We can't even keep the ones we have active
We don't own players, Chan. 
We drafted a really.good OLman who could.plag tackle or guard. We drafted a really good running back kind of early. We didn't get a QB in the first round 
We drafted an LB 
We drink beers @Jamie Bourque 
We ended up just scrapping the idea for now but may reconsider depending on how things go with daycare
We fed each other chopstickfuls of general gaus

We found him 
We fucked? We fucked. 
We Fuckholes are tolerant to your gay desires goody 
WE FUCKING DID IT 
We fucking lit baby
We get it, a lot of people die near you. Don't need to post on Facebook about it 
We get it. No one should vote again. You've made your point
We get it. You aren't a fan of or committed to anything involving real sports
We get physician loans for your first house which don't require money down, which promote home ownership for people going through residency who make less than minimum wage

We got a real barn burner going on between us Jamie

We gutta actually hit Love. He's being pressured but we have to hit him in the mouth 
We had a conversation about it earlier in the season. I believe either you or joe looked it up goody 
We had a day every summer I worked for the Melrose IT department where they would back a truck into the loading dock and we would literally throw out all the obsolete hardware we connected through the summer. It was really good stress relief
We had a Disney+ free trial before and Olivia watched stuff but I never did 
We had a great time without you 
We had a holiday party scheduled last year but it got cancelled. 
We had a last place punishment last year but John refuses to do the punishment he promised he would do 
We had a plural one this year
We had a radiology lecture today and the professor spoiled the latest episode of GoT 
We had an assembly freshman year after one of our classmates went to the emergency room after tripping on cough syrup. The principal spent 30 minutes telling us to not abuse cough medicine which ended up having the exact opposite effect 
We had an awkward group white mountain trip and everything 
We had both a family of rabbits and a groundhog living under our shed. Nothing stood a chance. Then Aspen fucked our shit 
We had Kristen's dad for tech support and he ended up breaking the LED screen
We had like an hour long discussion about this last week 
We had like one lecture on insurance
We had no misconception that you finished first, don't worry 
We had our own party at Uburger 
We had our welcome lobster dinner during my intern year there. 
We had select spritzes today. Don't know what it was but it was good
We had this discussion last year. I will again mention that cooking stuffing in the bird greatly increases your risk for salmonella. Bocker lives on the edge, confirmed 
We had this discussion Monday or Tuesday Chan. Get your head back into the groupme 
We had this kid in eagle EMS that no one liked, and he went through some random accountant who somehow screwed up his tax return. He would come to the EMS office and call her every day for like two weeks and just yell at her because he thought he knew more than she did because he was in csom
We had this whole discussion last season 
We had to abort our original landing because the pilots couldn't slow the plane down. Haha 
We had two months of drought that killed the potential. There are still colors, but like 5.5 on a scale of 10
We had voted on a different rule consisting of a 4 tiered system before the season started 
We have 100% talked about it in this GroupMe
We have a 10 team league 
We have a 3rd and 25 and they still almost convert. Ridiculous 
WE HAVE A BINGO 
We have a financial literacy curriculum during 3rd year of residency and part of it includes an invited lecture from a few companies that sell disability insurance
We have a group of 13 of us 
We have a kicker! 
We have a lot of relationships too. Only a handful of married couples 
We have a plausible explanation other than Covid 
We have a poll function for polls 
We have a stockpile of vaccines for if/when it's used as a bioterrorism weapon because the vaccine is effective even after exposure (like the rabies vaccine) 
We have almost a month of intern boot camp. I start in the trauma ICU on 7/22
We have always been best roommates 
We have an ethics class this year where if you miss a mandatory session without a reason (e.g. illness), you automatically fail the course
We have certainly talked about that exact photo previously within the groupme 
We have Clemson exactly where we want them 
We have Cutler right where we want him 
We have discussed your love for red delicious before and it literally is your worst quality 
We have enough goats in the groupme for a petting zoo 
We have had bad owners for a couple decades
We have John getting kidnapped by the cartel and Nick trying to walk backwards across the border. 
We have lost our only @Skimmer  participation in the GroupMe now
We have lots of unhoused frequent fliers in the ED. Most of them come in because they get shit faced and end up passing out in the bushes or the median of the street and a passerby calls 911. There is one guy who spends almost 24/7 in the ED. He has a care coordination note that says "XXX will often present to the ED because he does not feel safe in the shelter system, please consider allowing him to stay in the ED until he is ready to leave." Meanwhile when people try to help him by getting him clean clothes, or a sandwich, or a blanket, he responds by saying "get out of my face you fucking cunt" and then pisses in the corner of the waiting room 
We have moved on to Zach Wilson 
We have not discussed anything recently
We have not yet packed the dishes to bring over here. That's in our next car load 
We have seen Devin several times at Joe's tailgates 
We have some really good jerkers in this groupme 
We have talked about Zappe murdering Hoyer, have we? 
WE HAVE THAT 
We have three legit cy young candidates on the rotation. I would rather not have an extra pitcher that proved he's terrible for at least half the season and doesn't have the endurance to pitch from beginning to end 
We have to find people smart enough to run the government well but dumb enough to want to run the government 
We have to go back to our roots
We have to have a Fuckhole get together to watch that, right? 
We have to know a lot about Angela because we get her in the divorce
We have to make sure we lock Kevin up during this attempt. Do want John and Kevin to try and pull the old twin switcheroo on us 
We have to watch a woman/Rex Ryan announcer tandem for this game? 
We have zero proof that that's not your laptop 
We haven’t covered that in biostats yet 
We haven't even entered the 3-5 pm nap time period where I would expect Morcus to not respond 
We haven't gone through the location lottery but I am trying to do two at Newton Wellesley, one in Maine, one split between Maine and Tufts, and then is family med which is any number of small practices all over New England. Surgery is the only place I haven't picked a #1 for yet
We haven't gotten a first down since the first quarter. I don't think we are covering anything 
We haven't gotten that far yet 
"We haven't had our pats circlejerk yet today. So:
https://www.youtube.com/embed/NS_9PcJ18Ns"
We haven't taken into consideration the nuances of institutional sexism and racism. Since the league used to not let African Americans play, all white men should be reprimanded. Since the league doesn't let women play, all men should be reprimanded. Only minority women or transgender individuals should be elected into the HoF from now on. 
We haven't talked about this, but I'm going to watch the fuck out of this
We hemmed and hawed. Decided you were right 
WE IN THIS 
We just aren't covering anyone 
We just brought some of our trash generated from our renovation projects to the town dump and chucking things through the air into a huge dumpster is so lit 
We just gave up
We just going to gloss over that jboss is a Russian spy?
We just gunna ignore the arm around Van Noy's neck
We just had a thrilling lecture today from Theoharis Constantine Theoharides
We just have to get Darrow to fight Joe 
We just ignoring Smart getting shoved from behind on that jump ball?
We just signed a lease in Astoria
We just turned it on right before the Denver fumble 
We killed two of their qb's!
We knew he was alive because he was playing TCG
We knew that ages ago
We knew that before this 
We knew that he was attention seeking after his super bowl parade speech. All time weenie
We knew what Joe was all about when he let the 🐐list die for no reason 
We know 
We know chan. We know. 
We know who was pulling the strings
We know you are
We know. We told you that. 
We like them. They took Better Man to number 1
We lined up with 11 seconds too. How do you let that happen?
We literally all agree that the change should be made
We live in Massachusetts. They're called caramel delights 
We lost 
We lost a true visionary 
We lost but the path won 
We lost guys
We lost to Northwestern in the second around. We beat McNeese State in the first round. 
We made 10 of them actually
We made it to the gate in time 😔
We may need to trade Drake
We met at a dog park in new hampshire, stayed outside, and remained at least 6 feet at all times 
We might not have space for this franchise 
We missed a lot of shots that round 
We must discuss this 
We must own all the space that should be dedicated to knowing how to use microsoft office
We need a citizenship test
We need a QA/QI program for groupme members 
We need a Ron Artest-like player to throw a chair into the stands and get our team going 
We need a video, stat, goody! 
We need another fuckhole to get into Tufts. Have to meet our two fuckhole quota 
We need fucking Darrowball to turn this shit into a monarchy 
We need it
We need jimmy 
We need more Joness. That's the only answer
We need more trash talk here 
We need NK more than ever now 
We need playoff expansion
We need that tanking committee to take a look at the Fuckholes league 
We need the exact opposite of more basketball talk 
We need to find another ners fan to replace him with once he gets found dead in his apartment 
We need to get Sam in here 
We need to have quantifiable data on why John is a bad friend 
We need to start paying recruits under the table. That's never gone badly for other teams 
We needed a follow up post with a picture of the haircut 
We never got that scrum photoshop
We never had a Devin in this GroupMe
We never read the Leviathan in my philosophy class, but maybe I’ll give it a shot. Sounds like I could benefit from stealing political views from it 
We never sleep. Always grinding
We noticed. The GroupMe has benefited 
We noticed. Your post count suffered 
We only got one night. Double your pleasure, double your fun 
We only have GYN at RIH. Our GYN providers do OB next door at Women and Infants Hospital and they can do emergent OB cases at our hospital but we don't consult them for OB 
We only have pass/fail at Tufts. 99% of the class only cares about getting a passing grade or not
We out here grinding. 5 calls tonight. Do I get paid extra for each call? Nope. Would I get paid the same if I were asleep? Yes. Doesn't matter, need that grind 
We out here running plays from kids movies. What's next, the jaguars run the flying V?
We played soccer on the melrose high school field 
We played the first intercollegiate football game in history in 1875. And we won. 
We playin or what
We probably aren't dying off because of our extensive access to Sprite and Dayquil
We probably should go for two every play
We purposely left the GroupMe blank so you didn't have encouragement when you came back 
We ran out of time and Collie got autodrafted 
We really did a lot with those to improve our team 
We really going to ignore that goody still splits the check with his legal wife
We really gunna let John get away with the most Thompson thing that has ever been said?
We running with a 4 team league? 
We said Loco at 930 right? Sitting here waiting for you guys
We said the third weekend in March. 
We saved $1m on the cap and lost $3.5m in dead money
We scored more than that in my Melrose Basketball Association league championship games in middle school 
We seem to overvalue our first few rounds of picks then 
We should all decide where I should go for residency 
We should all sign up for a baby 🐐yoga class in New Hampshire 
We should also kill off anyone who is going to accrue over $200k in loans in the next few years. No need to keep someone alive if they can't afford to buy everything themselves 
We should also take all poor people and ship them to Russia/China to ruin their economies 
We should bail out medical residents 
We should bail out medical residents and all part time students who are going back to their second advanced degree program* 
We should bring back Jared Saltalamacchia 
We should build a second league with ppr. Make all of the teams and lineups the same, and see if any outcomes are different between the two leagues. Only way to properly investigate the matter 
We should cancel all my student debt and then see where I fall for net worth. For science.
We should cancel the space force
We should change our name from the patriots, it essentially gives us a clean slate and maybe we won't be accused of cheating 
We should definitely adopt that policy now. 
We should definitely go
We should go back to doing lobotomies. Those were happier times 
We should go back to the good old days, where fat people were too ashamed to even go to BC
We should go back to using Ventrilo for gaming 
We should go over my house and watch golf reruns
We should have a Fuckhole reading of Mr. Jerry Thornton's Knee Jerk Reaction this week in celebration of the Patriots win. 
We should have a rule where if you abandon your team, you have to find a replacement before you are absolved of your responsibility 
We should have gone back to yahoo after ESPN fucked us over 
We should have known this would happen after the 🐐list 
We should have planted Kovin in the middle of them. That would take care of the issue in 2-14 days 
We should have recorded more footage of the Bengals sideline 
We should invite Dovin back. One thing's for sure, he would never leave
We should just cancel basketball
We should just fuck them all to death 
We should just send all of our addicts and criminals to a random island and let them survive on their own. I choose Australia 
We should look into getting these as shirts for the Fuckholes 
We should microdose and skate without our helmets on
We should photoshop the Fuckholes image and change Chan's face to Channe Frank's 
We should pick the patriots. Fuck everyone else who doesn't support them 
We should plan a Fuckhole red sox game 
We should probably change the subject to something that matters then
We should really consult Kristen. She's the bigger fighting fan in the Kricker relationship
We should really try and get someone in house like Ryan Day. It would be great to have him on your staff. If you have someone like that, it would be hard to let him go....twice.
We should send twill a trophy 
We should shame Joe every time he wakes up in the morning and isn’t dead
We should start a podcast 
We should start a thread about it 
We should start curing our own Fuckhole-brand bacon. Sorry Nick and Darrow. 
We should start paying doctors more 
We should stop playing any snaps with Burkhead in the game
We should strip Joe of his vote and give it to Mr. Bourque 
We should take California with us so we have somewhere warm to vacation 
We should take emyr and darrow and make our own GroupMe 
We should trade Mac and a 7th round pick for the first pick in the draft this year 
We should try to poach an up and coming coach like Nick Saban
We socially distanced for an hour and then left 
We spent the entire rehearsal dinner at Shelbie's wedding shitting on Goody and his fantasy football choices 
We still fucking, tho? 
We still like you better than Marcus 
We still love you 
We still talking about golf? 
We stopping at Hong Kong for meat sticks?
We suck 
We supposed to have emergency funds?
We sure he doesn't also have 'rona?
We talked about it extensively for four days straight 
We talked with two other potential nannies who were not good fits and didn’t even get far enough to ask about price, but that first one was way more than what Google tells me the average price is for a nanny in Vermont. 
We then went to the area around Lake/Volcano Arenal, which is just absolutely gorgeous. Would highly recommend spending some time there. Again, there is active things to do like hiking around the volcano and boating on the lake, but there are also spas and hot springs (touristy) to relax. La Fortuna waterfall is very well traveled but was a really cool place to spend a few hours 
We treat anaphylaxis with epi, steroids, benadryl, and pepcid. I have no clue if they gave him something else
We trickle throughout the morning but it definitely explodes between 11 and 1 pm. Then again around 6 pm 
We used an old king sized mattress as a ring
We used to
We used to talk about real sports in here like professional football and women's basketball
We usually eat dinner at our coffee table, which is moved due to the reflooring so I sat on a camping chair and ate bad take out Italian while using a ladder as my table 
We went a couple weeks ago, next to no trails open but it was fun. I've never been to mad river but I hear some of the trails are just punishingly hard 
We went through over 200 hundred listings and not a single one from east providence popped up 
We were both bad. Maryland was worse. 
We were promised new track uniforms my sophomore year. They got them two years after I graduated 
We were so excited to get a raise without realizing that the school legally had to pay us more
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HANG OUT 
We were talking about 11/28
We were talking about Goody's, which was on Friday
We were talking about you in our other groupme 
We will bring dinner to you when it's ready 
We will forever know how @Skimmer feels about @The Big Dick Bandit 
We will have less Covid if we just stop testing for it 
We will know if the chips start to fail probably soon
We will never know 
We will no longer be skiing at an AIG-owned entity next month 
We will wake you up to freshen them up for us when we get there
We will, now that I reminded the GroupMe about your incompetence as a talent evaluator 
WE WIN
We win. Good work goody 
We won trivia. You all suck 
We won't be able to sign boogie when we sign Paul George 
We would avenge you
We would have been in a better position had our long snapper not fucked up 
We would know, if @The Big Dick Bandit and I were invited 
We would literally get stuck to the floor and never be able to leave 
We would pile boxes next to the mattress and jump off them like we were jumping off the top rope. My favorite move was the People's elbow off the top rope
We wouldn't have 🐐s if it wasn't for TWill. His incredible performance, causing Becker's underwear to moisten, following by his complete irrelevance is exactly what the definition of a 🐐 is. He bonded us together. I think I can honestly say that TWill stopped me from jumping off the Tobin (disclaimer: I wasn't actually going to do it, don't get me infirmed in a mental hospital) 
We wouldn't know that Jordan would sit if we still had a punishment
We yelled louder
We, as Americans, are not good at building walls 
We....tolerate 
We’ll add Alabama to the list once you’re there for your adult summer camp 
We’re coming for that undefeated in the preseason streak that the ravens have 
We’re handling Fournette’s behavior internally and will have things straightened out by next week. Ball Fondlers has no further comment on the matter. 
We’re not talking about an individual player. You referenced your collection of “players”
We’re on to lipid and heme metabolism now, Nick. Try to keep up. 
We’ve already said it’s a shitty rule 
We’ve had the P value discussion. He recognizes they are arbitrary. Still thinks they have value without a better alternative. We haven’t gotten to chi^2 values 
Weah has been Weah off today*
WEAK
Weak 
Weak as fucking shit
Weak ass DPI call 
Weak call
Weak call 
Weak Commissioner Darrowball was always my friend 
Weather patterns, probably
Weather update. It's cold 
We'd also be better if we couldn't change our names mid-season. 
We'd also have to stream the games at the Bourque Manor
We'd be responsible for $4.5 mil of Thomas's contract for the year, we have $3.2 mil in cap space. We'd have to get rid of someone worth a lot and Thomas has three more years on his contract with $10mil+ per year. Would be hard to swing 
We'd expect nothing less 
We'd have a segment about your hair every week 
We'd probably sneak over for a couple hours in the morning/afternoon tomorrow and then have another thing with Olivia's family on Sunday 
Wedding attire should be Vouri joggers and thrasher tshirts 
Wedding is done at 5. But have to drive home unfortunately 
Wedding trips are certainly the pinnacle of planning 
Weddings 
Weddings suck. The fewer I have to attend, the better

Wegmans is by far the best. Market Basket is the most nostalgic.

Weird as shit 
Weird because he started the whole with zero balls 
Weird because you hired them. You can't complain about the meal if you shopped for the groceries 
Weird pick
Weird that @Not a Lazy Bitch; Just a Long Covid Victim was in the GroupMe while the raiders were winning but now he has disappeared
Weird that both your dad and Goody have the same phone number 
Weird that he used to be good
Weird that I can do well in my other league 
Weird that Joe didn't seem to care about my post about Harold Landry despite supposedly being some sort of BC superfan
Weird that joe was proven wrong then stopped responding 
Weird that MLB is getting so much Fuckhole Facetime after the season gets shortned to 60 games. It is almost as if the league becomes more important when its games diluted out across half the year.
Weird that one party has people described in this GroupMe as "pieces of shit" and "murderers" but the other party has candidates that people would want from the other party 
Weird that she has time to have job, play fantasy football, AND play daily fantasy 
Weird that the drugs have IVs in their arms 
Weird that you pretend to hate him but also can't go 18 minutes without swapping spit 
Weird that you would mention the 🐀 out of the blue 🤔
Weird typo 
Weird way to spell Moss and Chism
Weird wrinkle in the MA golf course opening. RI still bans golfers from out of state at it's courses. Pawtucket Country Club is a golf course on the MA/RI border; most of the course is in MA but some holes are in RI. Legally, MA residents aren't supposed to play there but it's mainly a MA course 
Weird, @Skimmer actually messaged me privately to say that he's going to represent me pro bono
Weird, because your guy lost
Weird, didn’t come through at first for me 
Weird, I always thought he was the one who had his hand in kermit's anus
Weird, i had other apps update yesterday, but not PoGo. 
Weird, I texted John directly to ask him about a trade and he responded soon after. Guess they hate you
Weird, I think it would be harder for her to sleep next to you every night than to take care of a baby 
Weird, I thought he was going to be an all pro after that TD he had in practice 
Weird, I was told that he wasn't that guy
Weird, I would have thought you would have been upset by that decision but you seem pretty positive
Weird, I wouldn't think that you would be happy about those types of things
Weird, it doesn't throw off anyone who doesn't skim 
Weird, thats what I'm doing to bocker's team right now 
Weird, the broncos haven't lost yet this week
Weird, there were many other coaches who coached for the last two years AND had to coach in the playoffs 
Weird, those two home runs had no influence on my previous comment 
Weird. Did the price of oil increase? 
Weird. I got a notification that Joe was kicked out of the groupme but not one that he was added back 
Weird. I got called twice in college to Suffolk superior. Got cancelled the day before both times. I just got called this past summer too, but they scheduled me for a middlesex court 
Weird. My definition of a loser is someone who doesn’t come to watch the Patriots game at Chan’s with his friends
Weirdly enough, having a baby does not help your diet
Weirdly enough, my Facebook has been filled with a bunch of left-leaning people complaining about it 
Weirdly enough, not him
Welcome back to New Mexico
Welcome to every other football-related post in the GroupMe 
Welcome to living in Boston, Emyr.

Welcome to the Reclamation 
Welcome to Vermont
Welcomed home by the best
Welfare! Bone saw! Dishes for the dining staff! Race around the res! College football is fine the way it is! 
Welker**
Welker. Mccourty
Well
Well @Chancy Reagan, she couldn't say no 
Well a gang in Chicago just murdered a 9 year old execution style, so I am not really sure she's making it much worse 
Well according to the commentators, our kicker is hurt. That's our punter. 
Well actually a 28 because I have to stay through rounds on Monday 
Well actually Connor Wong beat that ass but keep trying to steal thunder from Chan and Frankie’s cousin
Well actually I had to leave his party because he is still in Modern Warfare....
Well actually I know the biological sex. It will assign its own gender and pronouns at birth

Well actually, he said "took them," implying that they share more than one 
Well actually, I think Among Us games are the best
Well actually, JJ "literally Barry Sanders" Taylor is literally Barry Sanders. And JJ Taylor > Jonathan Taylor, so Jonathan Taylor cannot be better than Barry Sanders 
Well actually, marble racing is still a thing
Well actually, the only things that were looted were things from the Capitol, which are paid for by our taxes, so technically they are public property and when stolen, it does not count as looting
Well actually, the spelling bee was in 2nd grade 
Well actually, there is no scientific proof that you could get a flock of Ravens large enough to carry a single player from Baltimore to Pittsburgh
Well actually, you were talking about the NFL. This is the NFL's free development league
Well all of my expenses are billed to mgh....
Well aren't you a negative Nancy. 
Well as of two days ago, the last time I paid attention, there was speculation he wouldn't testify so I refuse to admit that I'm wrong 
Well at least she will know to do the opposite that you tell her to do 
Well at least that was nice of him
Well at least the chargers logo looks like a lot of time and effort was put into crafting it. I'm sure they paid millions for a marketing firm to carefully sculpt it to meet expectations. Probably required dozens of hours of focus groups and rough drafts before it was just right 
Well at least you can see one movie with that gift card
Well at least you didn't give up much to get him 
Well Baylor is fucked 
Well Becker, once you cancelled, it all fell apart. It wouldn't be worth getting together with out you. 
Well Brady will break all of those records when he plays til he's 48! /s
Well Brock Holt too
Well clearly I am in the minority, and I understand your logic. It makes more sense now, but I will still disagree with the call. I'd rather not give us the chance to make a mistake 
Well considering goody and I are getting lunch and I invited you but you declined, fake news 
We'll cover this sequence of plays heavily on our sports network tomorrow morning 
Well despite Rowe initially saying he found out he was starting right before the game, he immediately contradicted himself by saying he played with the first team all week over Butler. I don’t think it was a surprise 
Well Ej Perry gunna get his shot 
Well Ethan works for a non profit organization, so that's one fuck up right there 
Well excuuuuuuuseeeee me for trying to get rules agrees upon in writing 
Well Frankie just got murdered so I guess I can say that the answer is Coach Carter now
Well fuck me. I am going to lose to goody this week
Well fuck that 
Well fuck your rheb 
Well fuck, I will take first in anything 
Well half of them work in a car factory all day and the other half have lead poisoning 
Well Hanley hit a homerun the other day. I don't think Olivia has ever hit a homerun off of a major league pitcher 
We'll have to listen to twice as much LaVar Ball on ESPN 
Well have you seen his new commercial 
Well he definitely wasn't shot in the leg and I would definitely label the entry location and midback and not lower back. Good think you switched from premed 
Well he didn't care enough to not skim when the whole GroupMe already made plans for once in our lives
Well he didn't delete any footballs so he's in the clear
Well he didn't get hurt, so that's a positive 
"Well he has to:
A) realize he’s been removed
B) read through his contacts to find your name, which we know will be challenging
C) spend 40 minutes typing out a one sentence message to you "
Well he hasn't scored a touchdown since week 4 so I consider him kind of s bust 
Well he is the type of officiant/DJ who would post his videos and pictures while the reception was going on 
Well he isn't getting hit in the face with a 96 mph fastball but he will probably end up in a coffin because of covid
Well he just fumbled so 
Well he knows how to get Mexico to pay for a wall. So there's that
Well he never called back, so it worked 
Well he wasn't able to open his protein jar today 
Well he went there 
Well he works the waiver wire without talking to us on groupme, so I'm feeling like we aren't that important to him 
Well he’s your child, I’m sure that has to do with what haircut he gets
Well he's from my hometown so 
Well he's playing against a good defense so his adjusted YPC is somewhere around 6 yards/carry 
Well he's right
We'll he's right*
Well his career is over 
Well how about putting him in right field (like they finally did tonight) instead of victorino, who sucks, or Allen Craig who can't field or hit 
Well HOW BOUT YOU PHILLIP ON DEEZ NUTS 
Well I agree with that, goody, so I guess this debate is about nothing. A true Fuckhole argument 
Well I am even more convinced that Biden has it in the bag
Well I can't come at Bock Boi anymore or he might leave the GroupMe again 
Well I can't go home in the middle of the Pats game so you're committed to having me until the Pats game ends. Looking forward to spending 7 hours trying to win back Ricky 
Well I didn't watch the video, so that's #NotMyNarrative
Well I don't have a coffee table anymore and would have to stream the game onto my tv, but I'm happy to have people over to watch the game or could have people over after bantam 
Well I got 1, 2, and 3. Step it up guys 
Well I got an email but I am in the Vermont with no cell service and the email said I would be getting s text so I assume I got the text 
Well I guess I can't gather in a room of 25 ppl for my exam this week.....
Well I guess I have to go change my scrubs now 
Well I guess I’m not coming to Fucksgiving then 😭
Well I guess Rory can't play anymore. Can't have a foreigner like him have influence on an American sport
Well I guess the better question is how this will influence Rachel Maddow, who is the sole influence on my mother's political opinions 
Well I guess V won't C U in the next round. OreGONE to the second round
Well I guess we settle this the old fashion way. First one to kill Darrow gets to keep both tickets 
Well I have an MBA and am an international traveler 
Well I have since I own 3
Well I just noticed I lost 1.5 points for a missed field goal. This is blasphemy
Well I just put the deposit on the apartment so hopefully I get someone to come through before we move in may. Keep me in your thoughts and prayers <3
Well I knew that, but I didn't know that the interest accrued gets added to your principal 
Well I lied. I believe that someone came in high on drugs. After that, all bets off 
Well I live near there but am in Vermont this weekend 
Well I managed triple digits 
Well I play on PC and won't be caught dead with a twitch account. But thanks for actually responding 
Well I realized I have zero lures and only 2 pokeballs so there's no way I'm doing that 
Well I sure have offended people then 
Well I wasn't invited to the wedding so I have to go to Chicago for something 
Well I wasn't invited, so...
Well I worked hard for 8.5 hours and then got screamed at by a patient when I stayed late to put an IV in that the nurses couldn't get 
Well if Darrow quits, I'm quitting next season*
Well if that's the case, I'm going to need a lot of cannolis 
Well if that's the case, then the article I read that I'm basing this take on should of specified that 
Well if they didn't keep losing in the championship game 
Well if we're reading it in the groupme now, it must be true?
Well if you're neutral, how am I supposed to take the opposite opinion
Well I'm burning 40 hours of vacation time for when I'm not in at all next week, so I'll have more like 270 by the time I finish 
Well I'm coming to the wedding now, invited or not 
Well I'm glad you have liked at least one of my recommendations 
Well I'm in LA so I don't know how I'd be confusing them...
Well I'm projected to beat you by 17. So I expect to lose by at lest 40
Well I'm quitting if Darrow is quitting 
Well is a relative term 
Well is he going to Sommerville or Somerville?! Make up your mind!
Well it all started when Hilary's emails mandated the killing of Harambe, which invoked chinese tariffs that were announced by dancing pre teens on TikTok, which somehow led to Iran sending sleeper agents into the US to pose as Antifa to pose as Trump supporters, who then stormed the castle and defeated Bowser, only to find that Princess Peach had been moved to a different castle. Now the #ThirstTrapShooter💦🔫 is the subject of a nationwide manhunt led by the Deep State I strip Americans of their constitutional rights. Trump was excommunicated by social media and Hawley is still a little bitch. 
Well it bothers me. 
Well it is a shortened week...
Well it is only a 17 game season plus playoffs, so it is finite by definition
Well it is, because we are making our own league where we autodraft, have no buy in, and are not allowed to make in-season mloves
Well it sounded fine until you said that the students received special treatment. 
Well it won't exist in 50 years so 
Well it's an IV formulated drug that requires hospitalization to administer, so it doesn't really take care of 80-90% of patients with rona 
Well it's fair as long as it has present value like a kicker thrown in 
Well it's one of the three...
Well it's over so I doubt that 
Well Joff is fucked
Well Josh Hawley is an idiot
Well just people who were in sasa trying to get into the tournament on the same team 
We'll lace your donuts with BDPs
Well Lamar and Tua are bound to get hurt, allowing him to start. Fields, Willis, Howell are all at risk of being benched for performance. Allen and Rodgers could provide him a ring. And Newton may enjoy Watson's misogyny .
Well let me tell you. Big Ben and AB combined for 61 points. Thanks for asking 
Well let's hope we don't have to wait for too long. Wouldn't want joe to get home too late 
Well Michigan lost to Ohio State so they should move up in the rankings this week 
Well Morcus didn't even show up today so
Well my new flight doesn't get in until 8 pm, so I'll be in then. I expect to see you still there 
We'll never know 
Well no one answered so I can only assume that the plans will fall through again
Well no one has said they are coming so I pretty much don't have friends
Well no you would have trade raped John in that situation. We only circlejerk about you getting trade raped when you actually get trade raped
"Well now it's not my only problem. My current problems are:
1) the PoGo tracking system
2) the amount of political posts on social media is too damn high "
Well now you're working for a budget department store so she wasnt that far off
Well of course he couldn’t. Lebron went straight to the NBA and thus surrendered his NCAA eligibility. Stupid question. 
Well of course you are unaware of the conversation. Otherwise you would have come to my aid.
Well of course you, the second biggest Trump supporter in the GroupMe, would support an insurrection led by the biggest Trump supporter in the GroupMe. 
Well ok then. 
Well okay then
Well on a balance sheet, salaries would be covered under liabilities
Well on my way to fucking your team up goody 
Well one is a sport and the other is shooty hoops 
Well one of them sings shitty music and is fat. And one of them sings shitty music and is hot. Not too hard to distinguish between the two. 
Well only 38% of Montgomery has reported and Jones has 70% of the vote there right now 
Well Perriman looks like he's dead
Well played 
Well polio is back in the United States
Well potassium is a very nice element. Very reactive. Unlike that response you just gave.
Well potassium is a very nice element. Very reactive. Unlike that response you just gave.
Well potassium is a very nice element. Very reactive. Unlike that response you just gave. 
Well rivers is playing as well as a soiled diaper right now. You probably would have gotten more from Witten 
Well said
Well said, @bockbot, well said. 
We'll see. I did miss all of Monday 
Well send us the post goddamnit! 
Well she is from the U.K. so it would make sense if she has offshore accounts 
Well since JBoss is cheating, Joel quenville is the NHL coach 
Well some of us did. The rest are very lucky. Poor Bocker was never the same after directly rooming with him 
Well someone already died so 
Well Sunday Ticket U is $100 so your "$250" is invalid
Well taking a timeout before the first play is not an ideal start 
Well technically they could have made the opposite decision
Well that blows. He must have had some hereditary thing like HNPCC or FAP. Or maybe he had UC 
Well that changes things 
Well that counts all of us out 
Well that coverage was not good. 
Well that game was boring 
Well that goes against every report so far 
Well that is an easy fix, just invite Darrow over
Well that just ruins my sarcastic response. Thanks Jordan. 
Well that lost its fun 
Well that sucks 
Well that sure is a take
Well that was a glitch and a half 
Well that was a nice catch*
Well that was a nice maybe catch 
Well that was close
Well that was fast 
Well that was quick
Well that was quick. I definitely had Shelbie widowed before Kristen in the Fuckhole pool 
Well that was supposed to be a gif. That sucks 
Well that was the worst argument I've had to read through in a while 
Well that would make too much sense, Morcus, since presidential elections are decided by the electoral college votes that are not dependent on gerrymandered districts that only influence state and local elections
Well that’s bad 
Well that's a given since we are a playoff team now
Well that's because Spacey raped a bunch of dudes
Well that's dumb 
Well that's just confusing
Well that's like saying that skydiving is more exciting than watching paint dry. It's not a hard thing to top 
Well that's not good 
Well that's pessimistic, Anthony. Someone is being a little Grumpy Gretel today  
Well the #1 seed won that game....so....
Well the Chinese gymnasts look like they're six....
Well the concern about mutations make sense. One of the ways we vaccinate against the flu is by targeting the proteins that help flu get into cells. The reason why we have to get vaccinated every year is because of a concept called antigenic drift, where over time, the protein target picks up small mutations that render the  immune response (and thus the vaccine) less useful 
Well the dining options talk only originated after you all having terrible opinions about Dots 
Well the entire state department's senior administrators resigned yesterday 
Well the government didn't shoot you or illegally hold you against your will, so you got that going for you, which is nice. 
Well the news is about 30 minutes old. Wouldn't expect someone in your state of health to be that tuned in to the important news of the country 
Well the only headline I have posted in days is the number of hospitalized patients going down....so check your subtweet privilege
Well the Patriots just completed the most Patriots-esque draft choice
Well the red line was shut down Friday morning because a cable caught fire in the middle of the night and they were bussing between Kendall and park. And today they had severe delays. So that's two days in less than a week with severe delays 
Well the whole point of sending Caserio to Houston was to plant another sleeper agent after BoB, Romeo, and Easterby failed us
Well then 
Well then 
Well then fuck me, I guess
Well then his parents should be filing for him.
Well then I guess we lost the third place game we played in. So I'd say one gold and that's it 
Well then my first narrative was right. I was working. Olivia and I showed up. Kendra was not with us. Bocker was a lying IDIOT 
Well then sure 
Well there are two. One is on ir. The other one missed his first game this week and will be back. 
Well they are a government agency, not a business. So
Well they are autonomous. Governed by no one but themselves
Well they can’t now that they have to go through Drake Maye
Well they don't spawn around me dicknuts
Well they haven't found one of them so....
Well they let Joe in, so obviously they don't care about the best experience possible for students. 
Well they thought he was psychotic enough to admit him for a psych eval.
Well those hill sprints he was running on Insta
Well to be fair, goat milk can be used to make different varieties of what we assume to be cow's milk cheeses
Well was it a passed ball or a wild pitch 
Well we already know we aren't since you skimmer
Well we have a replacement for Jamie when he doesn't take the SATs
Well we have been delayed three times so I am expecting that exact scenario to happen 
Well we hiked for six hours yesterday, two hours today, and jumped into some waterfalls, so...
Well we just dropped a wide open 50 yard pass 
Well we know from this GroupMe that that last part isn't true. Just look at @No Money No Problems 
Well we know he's not doing his taxes properly
Well we were 7 before we added Bock and Kristen. But apparently Bock got explicit permission to get to 9
Well we won't beat Clemson, we're going to lose to central Michigan, and then lose to VTech. He's practically fired already 
Well what does the bowl look like 
Well what I think she's referring to is adjuvant chemotherapy
Well what's the verdict, Joseph 
Well when cincy loses this game, I don't think he's going to play again this year 
Well when you consider Marcus Mariota and the FLB 
Well when you let up like six sacks in a row 
Well who else would govern medical policy? The AMA?!
WE'LL WORK AROUND IT
Well yeah, have you seen the north shore 
Well yes, but where is he seeing this
Well yes, that was oscar worthy
Well you can have pork tacos or beef tacos or tacos with avocado or shrimp tacos or chicken tacos 
Well you can't prove that the practices led to the outbreak, so...
Well you have to respect his legs. Truly a dual threat. Either that, or it's like swinging at a offspeed pitch. You're so baffled by how slow the pitch comes in, you prematurely swing 
Well you left the two defenses who scored the most on your bench so that doesn't help 
Well you, me, Ryan, Becker, goody, kevin, John, Emyr, and Jamie all live in or around Boston. So I say that we already have a large percentage 
Well your brain can't comprehend much...so
Well you're dead during the first one and usually not dead during the second so...
Well*. Typo. Fuck
Well, actually he probably still is outputting
Well, and Darrow
Well, Becker hasn't answered yet. 
Well, except for this guy
Well, he was white...so...
Well, I guess still 4th down. Doesn't really matter 
Well, I guess that’s another year without a championship for Joff 
Well, I guess the other Try Flowers is a cornerback but he's not the one to whom I am referring
Well, I highly recommend it. Feel like you would enjoy it 
Well, I’m going to the hospital to get treated for severe dehydration due to the size of the load I just blew in my pants 
Well, let me clarify. The people who had COVID previously had worse side effects after the first dose than "COVID-naive" patients. In the study, they were on par with the side effects people experience after their second shot.
Well, not "all of you"
Well, not "always destined." Pretty sure at one point you were destined to do coke with a hooker on Revere beach and end up crashing your car into a telephone pole, leaving the poor woman trapped inside, engulfed in flames and regret
Well, physical symptoms brought on by a congenital psychiatric illness.
Well, something Portu. Don't remember her first name
well, that was after he was held captive and tortured for five years...
Well, to change the subject from goody back to winning, it fees good to not have a punishment in the offseason this year 
Well, when socialism hits next week, we will all be supporting John anyway 
Well, yes. True 
Well...
Well....
Well....
Well.....
Well.....do they really count as children? They clearly have not brought him any joy or pride.
Well...I'm glad I asked 
Well??
Wellness check on @Ayatollah “Jar Jar” Thompson 
Wellness check on @Marcus Bauer 
Wellness check on Joe. Did you pass out in the 99 when you saw that blood? 
Welp

Welp, looks like the RNC is going to get the fuck sued out of them by Queen 
Welp, we officially have a zombie virus.
Welp, worry Marcus....
Welp. I lost this week. Too bad the Broncos forgot how to play defense 
Went dark the week before Memorial Day. No news. No updates. I am feeling quite lost
Went down harder than a Cowart family couch
Went for a resection*
Went out of GroupMe. 3/10 at best
Went over my head so you're obviously smarter than I am 
Went to ghostfish brewery today which was all gf and delicious 
Went up for a ball that was way up in the air, got pushed and landed on his arm/chest and spent the next minute rolling on the ground in pain 
Wentz
Wentz is bad, but this has to have Hurt(s) his ego
Wentz to the horseshoes

Were any of those movies actually in the 80s?
We're at DEFCOM1 here 
We're beating umass 5-1, so we have that going for us, which is nice. 
We're both drafted in 2020*.
We're eating at bar barber 
We're famous!
We're fucking talking football Anthony 
We're going night skiing at Bolton. You can meet us in the bar in the base lodge. Or you can wait til we're done and meet us at Sunset grille and tap in Stowe 
We're going to have to have some Fuckholes stationed on the Tobin when McGregor gets his skull punched in so that Goody doesn't take a one way trip into the river 
We're going to Kristen and Becker's for dinner and then left the door open to go out after 
We're heading back to my apartment in a few minutes if anyone is interested in joining
We're just fighting for the truth, and for fairness, and for honesty. You, Mr. Commissioner, can suck my left nut. 
We're learning about time value of money right now. I should be getting an MBA with my other degrees. I'm more financially savvy than Joe
We're like on the same wavelength brah
We're looking for a gengar. 
We're not even through a string of bowling. You are welcome to come here 
We're not the ones who told her that we were planning something for New Years at Clemson
We're on to the Jackson 5. Really celebrating black culture on the JetBlue hold line. Nice
We're picking you up in New York. That means only 4ish hours 
We're popping bottles tonight 
We're ready to spend. My ass
We're so bad'
We're so fucked. 
We're studying the biology behind gender identity and gender non-conformity in one of my classes. It's actually fascinating 
We're supposed to get 10-14 inches last I heard
We're talking about humans, not slug parasites that leach off of the friendship and support of others
Were the colts in Baltimore before they were in Indy?
We're the eggs prepared in the style of Gordon Ramsey 
We're thinking the Cranston location, right? I get out at 6 pm
Were those the ghosts that Sam Darnold saw?
We're two days away from the opening night of the Fantasy Fuckholes season and no one else is trash talking their opponent. Bunch of pussies. 
Were you also the Kirkwood Tickler?
Were you jacking it to the kiss 108 morning show again?
Were you not at UMass during the Svana years? 
Were you not expecting me to know what the spirit bomb was?
Were you too poor to afford a hotel room where the toilet is in a different room? Still not following why you couldn't turn on a light 
Were you wearing a helmet? 
Were you wearing a helmet? 
Were you? 
Were your little birdies in my grapevine?
Were your twelve grandfathers in hospice before they passed?

Weren't you going to Cabo at some point? 
Weren't you literally just complaining about not getting uncommon Pokemon 
Weren't you out on them last night
Wes dropping some love for Harold Landry on the pod
Wess locking up the Chargers was not a good look
Westbrook 
Western Mass
Western Mass is worse but the people from the west coast are unbearable. Especially people who grew up in the Bay Area or who relocate there for B school 
Western Mass*
Western Michigan is going to suffer their first quality loss of the season, which should guarantee them a top 10 finish in the end of season polls. 
We've been over this
We've done a lot of walking. They do have a train similar to the t that we used to get from the airport to our airbnb. It was slow moving but got us where we needed to go. It seems to stop in all the right places. The locals we've talked to all have recommended taking it to get to different areas 
We've found a bunch around that or cheaper, but no on wants to rent out to someone with a 6/1 move in 
We've had enough serious conversation. I will now insert a joke.
We've had this conversation servers L times. But the injuries stop the normal pace of the game. They wouldn't have taken a tv timeout in the middle of a drive if there wasn't injury 
We've noticed
We've talked about it a few times, @Skimmer. However, I support you still

When half your fucking cabinet has met with Russia before the election/swearing in, and then Russia hacks the election, and then nine sources in the intelligence community confirm that you discussed lifting sanctions before you were president, I think people have a right to be concerned 
When has Bernie every said "someone shouldn't be a millionaire"
When has Morcus been right about a football take?
When has that ever stopped anyone from posting in the groupme? 
When he blew the whistle, Rex was walking in front of the ref and pointing at the sideline. I am pretty sure he was yelling that Brady stepped out and the line judge just blew his whistle 
When he was drafted. 
When I bought my new couch, the movers damaged it ever so slightly because our apartment building is not meant for large couches to come through. The company tried to deliver a replacement today and ended up getting stuck, damaging the replacement, and cutting up the hand of one of the movers. We did not get the new couch but we did get a $200 reimbursement 
When I did eagle ems interviews, we used to put a paper clip on the table in front of the interviewee and see if they played with it during the interview. I enjoyed watching people squirm.

When I realize Becker rejected my fair trade. 
When I run for congress, I am going to mandate that all tv channels must have good tv 24/7 to help those of us who "work from home" 
When I said Malaysia, I was actually thinking of Myanmar. I knew that it switched from Burma to Myanmar, but that happened in 1989, just before the 25 year cut off 
When I said surface pro, I meant surface laptop 
When I see what airline Chan and Darrow are flying

When I used to watch ESPN, every replay all day was the LLWS.

When I was catching pidgeys stronger than my evolved pidgeotto, I realized my mistake 
When I was in school, I had to walk 15 miles, uphill both ways. And my family was too poor to afford boots and I still made it without bitching. These kids are going to be raised spoiled as shit. Need to be taught a lesson.

When I was looking a couple months ago, all of the flights to Naples had very long layovers
When I was talking about not being able to afford to pay betting debts, I was, however, talking about you.
When I went to bed, the Seahawks were up 24-3 with five minutes left. Who lets Russell Wilson throw a pick when the game is already decided?!
When I went, it was fairly busy, but it wasn't bad. Most "kids" were high school or older middle school age. I didn't have any really young kids I don't think

When Morcus brings up anything related to the school system
When my brother moved from Boston to Columbus, his company decided to give him a 6 mo trial of WFH so he could stay employed. They thought it went so well that they have allowed a ton more people to start to WFH (before corona of course)
When my grandma was 8, her mom died of pneumonia and she was adopted by her aunt and uncle, the Bucci family. They were real estate tycoons and owned pretty much all of the land in this map. Then the depression hit and they sold most of the plots back to the city for pennies on the dollar to pay off creditors. A lot of the lots there today are $1mil+

When the Bucs lose in week 5, Brady gunna force a trade back to NE. Book it.

When you just want Bock Boi to say hey back
When you kill someone in WZ, you get to hear their mic for like 1 second after they die to hear their reaction. But you can't talk to them. I had to voice the emotional toll of the nasty word to my teammates, @Female Body Inspector Agent #69  and @👀 
When you look at the democratic breakdown, it looks like sanders won way more cities than Hillary. Hillary just win in the cities with high population that weren't in western mass or the cape

When you received these massages from a naked female, did you refer to the the process as "barebacking it"
When you refused to acknowledge that you're in darrow's crew 
When you remember that your team is cursed by Matty P's presence again
When you say "we can use logic," you're referring to #JustFacts*greencheckmark* and Drachman, right?
When you say average, what measure of central tendency did you use? Mean, median, and mode all mean average in different circumstances. For example, if manager has RB #5, 10, 11, and 98 on their roster, their overall mean is going to be greatly skewed to the right. In that scenario, you should use the median as a measure of average.
When you talking politics but the groupme dead af
When you think about it Jordan, isn't everything in this groupme a troll?
When you think about it, a muffin is kind of like a sandwich 
When you think about it, he's probably going to run the least corrupt administration in history. He's not going to take bribes from big business lobbyers, because that's just going to help his company's competitors

While Goody not participating in fantasy normally #FitsMyNarrative, I would much rather be part of team #JustFacts*greencheckmark*.
While he likely has another exam to study for, I refuse to give him the benefit of the doubt. I hope your test bursts into flames immediately before you pass it in, darrow 
While I admit that my original take on the riots over the summer was that damage to public and private property was warranted due to the mistreatment of disenfranchised members of the population, I remember expressing in this groupme that I had changed my opinion and denounced any further destruction. 
While I agree that Bock's document looks like trash, Joe has no right to criticize him after he murdered the 🐐 list 
While I agree with that general statement, it is undeniable that access to abortion in many states is incredibly difficult and often traumatic for women, and states are getting bolder with the current Supreme Court configuration
While I am not a Bo hater, I am a hater in general and even I am admitting that I should have Bolieved (can you believe Google tried to autocorrect this?) harder 
While I appreciate your theory, please leave the detective work to the experts. This could not be the case, as we all know that Prima would choke Bocks out during sexual relations, not the other way around 
While I cut out posts in the middle, none of them referred to the Ragnar race
While I did not inspect this individual for the presence of a dong, his preferred pronouns were he/him
While I do love dogs, I am at the maximum capacity of dogs in my household right now 
While I do not support Mr. Becker's actions, maybe Mr. Becker wouldn't be acting out if the current commissioner had followed through with his punishment of forcing "All Day Daycare" to be run by Ms. Clark for four weeks. We need a leader who will enforce his punishments. #JohnForCommissioner, #JohnForABetterFuckhole
While I don't want to admit that I was wrong, I am reading that vulvovaginal candidiasis can be associated with a thick, curd-like vaginal discharge, however it is non-specific and could be caused by many other infectious etiologies
While I got the number of years wrong, I did predict the APY
While I have never and will never ride on the Kirk Cousins monorail, I agree that the Skins are bad and should feel bad
While I have no part in this trip, I would like to object and hope that chaos ensues 
While I know bocker said he was having dinner with family, I like to think that he's not answering you because he's getting mad engagement sex 
While I recognize that you have been to my apartment, there is no way that your brain, which has been destroyed by many vodka waters, has been able to retain that information.
While I re-ee-ee-eally (read in Doctor Cox voice) want to go on an sjw hate rant right now, I'm going to spare you all from it. 
While I very much enjoy canned cranberry sauce, I can’t skimp on one of my favorite flavor profiles 
While I want to do it, not sure I will be able to 
While I would gladly be a scab for Bocker to stop him from being able to enjoy a round of golf, I understand his commitment and support him. 
While I would love to attend, as I have already regrettably informed you, I will be in Connecticut for a wedding 
While I would love to blame Bocker, I don’t want to inflate his sense of control over the patriots’ destiny 
While I would love to provide concrete evidence at this second, the act website has not released score reports for my test date as of yet, so it hasn't listed me as canceling my scores yet. When that updates, I will be happy to follow up 
While I would prefer Brady to deflect all questions about this or to say something supportive of Syrian refugees, reporters asking him these questions are fucking dicks. Either you pin Brady against a friend who vocally spoke out in support of Brady during deflategate, or you write a national headline talking about how Brady is a racist and hates immigrants. There is no meaningful story here, just douchebag reporting. No wonder why athletes hate the media 
While i wouldn't mind a down year for those two aforementioned players, I would feel bad about former Patriots legend Romeo Crennel's defense having a bad year, as that would likely mean he would get sacked. 
While it could have been a joke, I choose to believe that John skimmed and doesn't know who asked for the ticket 
While it doesn't quite fit the list for profound moments, I think going up to the parking garage ramp to to watch some BC baseball with da boiz was one of my best sports memories
While it isn't a long term solution, jordan you were saying earlier that you see non-payers as one of the biggest problems. Now you have 20 million fewer non-payers 
While it may be a farce, I actually think their method of running this focus group is effective
While it would take less time than the red line on days like today, I don't have a spot to store my bike at my apartment. The only spot on the porch is taken, and I can't chain it to front fence because the landlord is a douche. Also, no fucking way am I biking in the winter 
While Joe is taking forever to respond, can someone tell me if I'm an asshole for thinking that this text Olivia just got is absolutely insane:
While originally I thought it was gross, I can now see the error of my ways and fully support your sink peeing habits #JustFacts✅
While other Joff would absolutely love that, this Joff says Thanks for the invite!! But will pass 
While rationally, I would agree with you, this is the Fuckholes so I must insist that Peyton blows donkey cock
While that is a very accurate narrative, it is not the narrative that I choose for myself
While that is true, I resent any comparison to Marcus. 
While that is true, it is #NotMyNarrative
While the buffalo chicken dip was certainly the star, I think there was a pretty good supporting cast of food at that party 
While the burglar would have had to pass by four different bedrooms before entering the room where he was found—and had the opportunity to steal a laptop, a Canada Goose jacket, wallets, jewelry, and other valuable items that were out in the open—the residents said that the only thing stolen was a pair of AirPods.
While the day may not have gone as well as we all hoped, there is a certain group of football players wearing orange uniforms that need our help right now 
While there are probably 8 year olds who play, Fortnight is definitely not for 8 year olds
While this scenario exists for Jordan, I actually did pitch in little league and have a 0.000 era 
While we are on the subject, I watched Goodfellas for the first time the other day. Thought it was better than average, and it don't get more positive than that
While we are on the topic of denouncing global entry things, I also want to denounce that Logan and Hartford are the only true locations in Massachusetts. Maine has 2 that are as far east on the Canadian border as you can get and Vermont has one just east of Jay Peak on the border
While we are on the topic, why do we separate men's and women's races? They are all equal, they should all run together
While we are talking about the AFS, did anyone listen to the Playcallers series? 
While you might be correct, I will not admit that I am wrong 
Whine? I have never whined in my life. I think you're thinking of the wrong Groupme. 
White bread is pretty risky for me
White chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter
White hispanic + white nonhispanic = white
"White House expected to recommend all Americans wear cloth masks to prevent coronavirus spread
The White House is expected to announce a new policy, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that would urge Americans to wear cloth masks in an effort to prevent coronavirus spread, according to a federal official familiar with the policy."

Why wouldn't I roster the next big star qb in the NFL?
Why wouldn't you play them 
Why yes I did 
Why yes. I also agree that was bs. I clearly know what you're talking about. 
Why you claiming @u/JimmyMcNultyDrunk as your man? That really brings down your quality of life 
Why you gutta make this not about race?
Why, did Pittsburgh deflate balls again? Oh wait....
Why?
Why? He literally had one job and he fucked it up 
Why? So he can embarrass himself on national tv while ESPN and other non-basic cable sports news networks beat him off around the clock?
Why? The Bruins and Red Sox won.
Why's it gutta be a black mark?

Wide open receiver on the far side of the field

Williams sisters lost in the first round too 
Williams?

Willing to discuss trading almost anyone on my roster for a few draft dollars

Win* 
Windows 10 has the equivalent of F.lux built into the OS (not onion shield)
Wingspan up to 120 cm. But max recorded speed is 242 mph. Eagles can't match that speed 
Winners win 
Winning percentage when 9.5 point underdogs 
Winning run is up at the plate. #DoDamage #MoreBadCatchphrases
Winnipeg Jets 
Wins are a QB stat 
Wins are not always a marker of a good coach. Cant win if your players suck  Leadership potential, player development, in game management, etc. is just as important. Which is why he's coaching the most successful franchise in nfl history and not coaching an amateur sport
Wins/losses won't show up on Kevin King's stats page 
Winston is bad at football 
Winston is so bad.
Winston 😔
Winter had me call every patient who we collected data on before to make sure it was accurate and to update it with any new developments, so I got through all but one patient. And then there is this one grumpy guy who we need to collect data on for the first time. Winter consented him, I called him, he told me that Winter never consented him. Winter called him back, got consent again, and now the guy won't pick up
Wisconsin 🐩 Wisconsin play calling 🐩 Wisconsin Oline 🐩
Wisconsin? More like Pissconsin
Wise. Dugger has been not great this year
Wish he spent some time talking to us instead of digging through all of the NFL breaking Twitter reports
Wish I knew you were there. My father got us into the super exclusive area where you need to pay $18,000/year just for membership. Would have tried to sneak you in. It was almost empty 
Wish I was as good as Joe
Wish our commissioner was here to discuss these important issues
Wish Pats could have a consistent OLineman like him 
Wish the Pats had a decent tight end like Hollister on their team 
Wish the Pats had a dynamic tight end presence like Jonnu Smith
Wish we had two more points tho 
Wish you were too bby 
Wishing everyone except Darrow an above average Friday. 
With a backup qb
With a stopped clock 
With Alison?
With all the first round picks on the pats offense, it's hard to keep track of who they should be covering 
With all the time I spend on Truth Social, I don't have time for BeReal
With all these people coming out in support of the $25 movement, maybe one day I'll get exonerated from the crime of forcing the league to pay only $25 each
With apparently a set of big onions  
With blackjack and hookers?
with COVID*
With Dr. Lt. Gov. El Guapo
With his gun safety knowledge, that death would come rapidly
With his speed, I was hoping to get him some quick separation-type routes to get the ball out of Brady’s hands quicker
With how fucked airports have been recently, I cannot fathom showing up 40 minutes before a flight and expecting that to be enough time
With how long it took him to get a credit card, are we even sure he has a bank account?
With how much Joe cheats and brags about it, I finally know why we haven't seen much of B school Taylor lately. Probably got fed up with his lies and adultery '
With James Cook scoring every touchdown for both teams
With Jordan? Please.
With my comment and your continued support of the Chiefs, hopefully we can manifest a reverse jinx 
With no bench players and only $5 waiver wire dollars 
With or without a spoon?
With Paris 
With that attitude you are
With the amount of meat that you stuff into your mouth, I'm not surprised that a single burger doesn't fill you up

With the current healthcare structure, there is no scenario where a government exclusive rollout would be superior to that of the private sector 
With the help of tennis balls 
With the number of draft picks they have every year, you'd think they could draft a reasonable kicker
With the regionality and the pull BC has in NY and NJ, that's really sad 
With the 🐐 list 
With tj Yates as their shafting quarterback 
With two timeouts, kicking deep would have made sense 
With which Thompson twin was the first cumming of Danielle?
With which to inconvenience the Fuckholes*. Sorry @( 👉🏼^_^)👉🏼 
Witherspoon too early 
Without a brain
Without barbells
Without Ben, these are two of the worst offenses I think I have seen in the last several years 
Without going to the Bills subreddit, I know there are a million posts complaining about the Tua concussion controversy 
Without Gregg who sucks 
Without kurchley, bc has no defense 
Without question 
Without thinking about any consequences, I am in favor of this change
WKUK Sex Robot on a loop
WL was responsible for the Dem email release before the election, too, correct?
WMass*
WMed being 9-0 and not being in the top 5 is an egregious example of SEC bias 
WMich* 
Woah 
Woah 
Woah did anyone ask Jordan before adding Frankie to the GroupMe?
Woah guys, cool it on the nazi jokes. We now have 1.5 Jewish people in the groupme so we have to start being sensitive to their feelings 
Woah look at buzzkill Chan over here 
Woah we got an income number!!! 
Woah what happened to the NFL? 
Woah woah woah 
Woah woah woah. Let's not speak in broad generalities. Some of us are good at other things besides taking care of our bodies
Woah woah woah. We did not vote on the trade deadline. Once again our slave master of a commissioner is forcing his awful decisions upon us. Bocker's whole family is going to die because of this.
Woah! Is that Andrew Becker or hulk hogan?!
Woah, as the one affected by the skim, I do not allow it
Woah, let's not jump to the conclusion that this was murder. She could have just been trying to significantly maim!
Woah, this blatantly disregards the information you made us privy to on Zoom
Woah. Be careful. We aren't allowed to point out typos or every post that gets edited 
Woah. Beat Indy before you start planning to play New England 
Woah. Foxtrots don't pull knives on other foxtrots 
WOAH. Give a warning before you come in with takes that hot
Woah. You just said that Julianne and Mr. Bourque could beat Joe. That doesn't mean he's terrible, as they are very talented golfers
Woe is me 
Wok away
Wok Away - Bocker's favorite
Wok n Talk doesn't have a minimum order total for delivery. But their delivery fee can be higher than Lobster Wok depending on the distance from the restaurant. That's very important to look out for 
Wok n talk was always on foodler but I never ordered from there. I never had a bad meal from Lobster Wok. I agree with Becker's assessment. 
Wok*
Woke up to being shit talked in the GroupMe. The GroupMe is lit again. 
Woke up to four emails, two texts, and two phone calls at 3v am saying that all of our systems are down
Wolfman, however, passed away 
Woman merged across a lane of traffic and hit me in the side rear. She tried to stop so it was a low speed collision
Woman's*
Women can be vampires too
Women love nothing more than women hating women

Wonder how close bocker will get to 12 likes 
Wonder how this would influence my mom, who claims to be on the Pete train 
Wonder if Goodell has the power to force him into a change
Wonder if he spent company money on that like tiki hut guy 
Wonder if he's still going to the Red Sox winter weekend
Wonder if/when John O’Keefe’s family will sue Karen Read for wrongful death, since the bar for being found liable is much lower 
Wonder what it looked like when deflategate broke 
Wonderful. Then I will keep on winning 
Wondering if I can say that he got richer 
Wondering the same thing
Won't be home til later in the day so it's a no from me. Were you going to go to nashoba?
Won't hurt my draft too much 
Won't improve your team much

Woulda been a better story if he went to the Pats
Woulda been cool if bc sent him 
Wouldn’t be worth more than Kamara...
Wouldn't be me
Wouldn't be opposed to the general idea, but your example is improbable. Hospitals require a bunch of shit (immunizations, CORI, etc.) to even get hired as a volunteer, and most hospitals have an application that can take weeks to hear back about
Wouldn't be surprised if another Morcus has gambling debts to repay 
Wouldn't could you out yet 
Wouldn't have been a line at bowling 🤔
Wouldn't have happened if they flew a real airline 
Wouldn't it be great if he could play on an offense where he didn't have to assume the role of #1 receiver, since his age probably prevents him from being a true number 1. Wouldn't it be great if he played on a team known to bring in and fix locker room distractions. Wouldn't it be cool if he went to a team where he could play his first playoff game
Wouldn't it be great sharing an institution with me, @Boe Jourque 
Wouldn't MAGA Nick be more likely to say the partisan public health officials in Massachusetts are pushing the left agenda by trying to make the numbers look worse than they are and it is all a hoax?
Wouldn't need the poll if people just updated the document goody made 
Wouldn't that be 31 games then?
Wouldn't trust*
Wouldn't want a coach with less than 7 wins
Wouldn't want to plan a vacation with Morcus. Definitely wouldn't want to fly Delta. They can keep the invite
Wouldn't you be miserable if you had to sit next to a troll all game 
Wouldn't you rather hear about how great Brady is for having to throw the ball into the ground every other play?
Wouldn't you rather suffer through fantasy so goody shoots himself?

Wow, darrow is a fucking savage 
Wow, fuck me I guess
Wow, fuck. Feel horrible for that family 
Wow, glad he kept us updated
Wow, good catch Goody. My phone fucked up. I meant to say 1928
Wow, guess I will go fuck myself
Wow, guess I will have to ask Joe to take your place. At least no one will know the difference
Wow, have to make everything about you, huh? 
Wow, how interesting. Please tell me more
Wow, I am sorry I ever doubted you
Wow, I can't imagine how oppressed you must feel 
Wow, I have to question his whole character now 
Wow, I missed fewer free throws than him in high school. I should have even drafted by an NBA team 
Wow, I should just work there. I'd make almost the same amount in two days as I make the whole week now 
Wow, it's almost as if winning on the opening possession is as guaranteed as a coin flip
Wow, Joe and Bocker. Two racists in this GroupMe. Must be a Toonie thing
Wow, Joe is in another foreign country. What a life 
Wow, less than a year into marriage and your wife already took the kids (dog) and left 
Wow, savage question on #3
Wow, that play Hurt
Wow, that stinks that they are doing construction outside his hotel window
Wow, the ACC is so deep, that another middle of the pack ACC team was able to beat one of the top four teams in the country 
Wow, we all have different picks this week 
Wow, what a great job by Herbert putting the team on his back
Wow, what great children

WOW. Big news from the Around the NFL podcast from yesterday 
Wow. Can't even spell your name right, Emyr. 
Wow. Goody gets challenged to a dance off that he can't handle and immediately backs out of his own battle 
Wow. Have to stoop real low to make fun of long Covid like they
Wow. I feel honored to have been invited directly by Kristen yesterday. Guess she doesn't care about the rest of the fuckholes enough to know their email 
Wow. I had a stroke 
Wow. I only won 30-0. I'm a fucking scrub 
Wow. I surprisingly agree with him about something 
Wow. I wouldn’t make you guys eat anything less than Santarpio’s 
Wow. Imagine driving from southern Massachusetts to meet your friend at Encore just for him not to show up
Wow. Just when you think you know a guy, he shocks you with exponential personal growth and an improvement in his overall intelligence
Wow. Motion to ban Becker for the last three games 
Wow. Skimmer
Wow. SKIMMER

Wow. Tell me how you really feel
Wow. That was the wrong window. Sorry guys. Fuck you all
Wow. That’s two absolutely horrible kicks 
Wow. The $10 extra I pay on top of my Hulu subscription is truly prohibitive 
Wow. What a difficult life
Wow. What a shame. Can't even remember the date of an important event like the day Kristen murders Joe. I, for one, obviously remember exactly when the event is to occur and do not feel the need to help out idiots such as yourself who don't take the time to prioritize the GroupMe. I just hope (for your sake, not mine, obviously) that someone posts the date.
Wow. Women can be doctors too Kovin

Wynn, Dawson, Bentley, Berrios hurt. Izzo, Sam cut (don't know if they were on PS). Etling I think went to PS. Crossen and Michel were the only ones who played (ignoring Bentley playing and then getting hurt)

Yahoo =/ CBS last time I checked 
Yahoo app throwing a little shade to JFF
Y'all (aka @Chandrew Becker ) gave me a hard time for removing Jamie for readding Marcus without consulting the GroupMe first. Then Jboss disappears for about two months, only to come back and drop the skim of a lifetime. Then he disappears again and won't even answer for his transgression. Now he's accepting blood money from #BigNorovirus. Why do you keep supporting this man?
Y'all are filthy skimmers. 
Y'all are skimmers 
Y'all are welcome to come watch the game in Vermont
Y'all can't possibly feel that way since I still have 2/3rds of a pan of dip in my fridge 
Y'all forget that we play to win the game 
Y'all gutta get in sous vide-ing your meat. Kristen and Bocker gave us a sous vide off of our registry and Olivia's parents gave us a sous vide bucket and vacuum sealer for Christmas 2 years ago. The best steaks I ever make are sous vide to 120 and then seared high and fast, just enough to caramelize the outside 
Y'all gutta stay up on important news like Halo TV

Yea that's why we have glutenfreesingles too
Yea, but trust me, no one had any faith that you'd actually come through for us and accomplish something meaningful with your life 
yea, fuck you Goody
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah

Yeah 
Yeah :(
Yeah 4th down play was gud. I was referencing the 3rd down play 
Yeah 65+ opened today, which is why the site has been offline all day. But it still objectively is an awful system as per my gripes above. I will let my parents know about the phone line
Yeah 67 is not ridiculous, 75 is way too warm. Luckily we haven't turned the heat on in my apartment this year and my apartment hasn't gone under 70 degrees
Yeah a bunch of US congressmen do
Yeah AJ already threw a touchdown to AJ 
Yeah and Hamilton asked Daveed Diggs to write a letter to the French to come and help. Otherwise they would have been screwed 
Yeah and I'm going to regret this when I wake up for work tomorrow 
Yeah and my mom had cancer. But she brought me into this world so she can't be that good of a person 
Yeah antigenic drift by definition is specific to the HA and NA proteins in influenza. I was using it more to illustrate the concept of vaccine targets mutating. There have been some papers about the spike protein in Covid mutating but so far there is no data to suggest that it matters clinically. That's why we don't know about immunization schedules in the future 
Yeah at the minimum, needs it staggered
Yeah basically you have to get past the contract you get drafted on and then you make bank if you are a star
Yeah because Russell Wilson has beat BB in a game that actually matters 
Yeah because your knife blade never comes up higher than your knuckle (or at least it shouldn't) so you have no risk of cutting yourself and you can push the fold under the knife 
Yeah Becker, not all of us are privileged enough to not have a job but still have a premium cable package 
Yeah becks, I'm not opposed to the IR spot either, just trying to leave no stone unturned in terms of ideas so we don't make a decision and then decide two months later that we don't like it 
Yeah bocker, about time. Why did you wait so long? Anyone who waits that long is an IDIOT 
Yeah Bocker, get it right 
Yeah Bocker, John can sabotage his team anyway he chooses 
Yeah Bocker, why do you feel the need to brag that you went to the library? 
Yeah Bocker. IDIOT. This is why Kovin was always smarter than Bocker 
Yeah buddy
Yeah buddy. I'm in the back of the discount shoe aisle with my hand up 
Yeah but 60 injured himself on the hold so that should also offset itself 
Yeah but all the sexy pics he could share with IG that he keeps secret 
Yeah but at least he fixed our gun control issues 
Yeah but at least she isn't a serial killer who operated in Northern California in the 60s and 70s
Yeah but based on the return of investment and total expenses, it doesn't add up to a total of $200m
Yeah but crazy people don't come from specific countries
Yeah but did he win a championship? Personal stats don't matter unless you win it all. #PatriotWay
Yeah but everyone is voting for him because he made that sexist comment about women coming out of the kitchen to vote for him 
Yeah but goody, at least you also found a career that you're 100% committed to and are going to school to further your education and expand your horizons in the field you love 
Yeah but Goody's looks like it could have it's own gravitational field 
Yeah but he cheated 
Yeah but he won't hit .350 because he blows ass
Yeah but he’s not because #SethMoulton
Yeah but he's friends with mort, so how do you trust him?
Yeah but he's not a racist old guy who has sexually assaulted a lot of women and is incompetent at his job
Yeah but he's not a republican so it doesn't matter #NotMyNarrativr
Yeah but how much money did you make trailing his bets? 
Yeah but I am not sure the Colts know they're down since they're still running every first down and running routes short of the sticks on 3rd and medium
Yeah but I bet Joe is out on it
Yeah but I have intense abdominal girth to help me take on anyone 
Yeah but I like the Saints. Roger tried to kill them, just like us 
Yeah but I love when you're a bitch 
Yeah but if it's anything like the mini-apartments in New York and Texas, you pay more money to have less 
Yeah but if they weren't wearing the superfan shirt before because the motto made them stand out, wouldn't completely changing the color of the shirt make them stand out more and thus make them less likely to wear it?
Yeah but if you argue that there is no gender gap, you get invited to weddings 
Yeah but if you label it gluten free no one is going to eat it 
Yeah but I'll have a desk for like three months 
Yeah but in reality she was literally just psychotic 
Yeah but instead we are making pussy engineering school a priority
Yeah but IRB approval would be hard to get when you say "I want to purposefully infect research subjects with a novel virus that we don't know a lot about."
Yeah but it actually means something because I said it 
Yeah but it is asking me to disable my ad-blocker, which I am totally not going to do
Yeah but it was third down on that play
Yeah but it's better for my narrative if I say you didn't
Yeah but it's more fun disparaging Kovin's character in the groupme 
Yeah but it's more of a play and less of a novel 
Yeah but it's pretty cool they didn't because I was at this game 
Yeah but Kavanaugh was guilty and got away with it and Biden is innocent and is getting smeared through the mud. /s
Yeah but Kevin is participating in the yearly tradition of implanting medical students onto the set of Scrubs and seeing how badly they can fuck up an amazing tv series 
Yeah but let's just agree that Joe's team is the worst 
Yeah but mine is the best. I have the best list. No one else has a list as good as mine 
Yeah but now he’s antagonizing on behalf of Erin. You guys say that Bocker and I are whipped, but that kid hasn’t had his own nuts attached to his body since ‘Nam
Yeah but now I will have his bobblehead. Big game changer. 
Yeah but Odam Thoelens doesn't work as well
Yeah but our commissioner decided to overvalue touchdowns, which he has only scored a few of this year
Yeah but out of you and Andy Reid, only one of them is dieting
Yeah but reddit 
Yeah but she has Celiac so she doesn't count as a person
Yeah but the guidelines are wrong so you are a villain for blindly following them
Yeah but there was a hold so it makes it ok 
Yeah but they are gluten free 
Yeah but they just changed the format and it seems too dependent on fan votes (see John Scott incident)
Yeah but they own ESPN, which is a failing organization that spreads lies. 
Yeah but they signed the 3rd best quarterback in the league (now that Tom has retired)
Yeah but two more wins than all of last season already 
Yeah but we still have Hoyer
Yeah but we were talking about lululemon before 
Yeah but we will have as much of a claim as Bama if neither plays! 
Yeah but we won't beat C Mich
Yeah but we're talking about@JB12  not you
Yeah but what about me
Yeah but what about that time that I listened to a random Red Sox game until 3 am and Shea Hillenbrand hit a home run into the net above the monster (pre monster seats) to walk off 
Yeah but what if one of the people he hurt was a hot chick? She may be permanently disfigured 
Yeah but what is the QB rating saying? Far more accurate performance metric 
Yeah but where do you rank the meats 
Yeah but you can't with Celiac 
Yeah but you did it to inspire change
Yeah but you haven't watched the wire
Yeah but you lost to me Joe 
Yeah but you paid the NFL off to shut the lights off on Ray Lewis!!!!!!
Yeah but you shouldn't help a school for rich white kids
Yeah but you’re going to be stuck in airport security 
Yeah but your fourth travel companion hated you IIRC 
Yeah but you're an apple-fanboy-bitch
Yeah but you're married to the #content
Yeah but......lol Mets
Yeah chan the 15 year at the restaurant was $120 a glass 
Yeah Chan, we all remember that we got here because Jordan told people to take a stand by voting for a third party candidate, thus causing Trump to win by small margins in several key swing states 
Yeah critical care just refers to care in the ICU
Yeah cuz you were there 
Yeah definitely that one 
Yeah definitely. Like you said, it's a slippery slope but it's hard to justify being completely against it 
Yeah especially when you land at the yacht and some asshole takes the helicopter so you have to run to the circle which is all the way by the slurpy swamp
Yeah everything takes a little more time when VPNed in versus being on an office computer. Specifically, the report I needed to run identifies patients with a certain diagnosis being seen in our clinic next week. I use it to find patients who are not yet enrolled in our study. But the report won't let me export the data to an excel file, so unless I want to transcribe all of the data by hand, I can't do anything with it. Everything else works reasonably well 
Yeah except he would be behind Taysom "Steve Young" Hill on the depth chart
Yeah except if you read the police report, the passenger couldn't get out of her vehicle and she acknowledged that it was ok for Fleming to break the window to rescue her 
Yeah Frank and I don't get along. He tries to kill me with his dander 
Yeah fuck that dude
Yeah fuck that pussy bitch 
Yeah fuck those guys! (What did they do?)
Yeah fuck your choice in careers joe. It's boring as shit and we all hate it, so it's pretty much what you deserve
Yeah gluten straight up sucks 
Yeah goody you don't know shit 
Yeah goody. Stop making anal cancer the butt of your jokes 
Yeah he destroyed a horcrux 
Yeah he got beat but DMac didn't pick him up despite being in position to do so 
Yeah he said it wrong. I think what he meant is that if your whole foot comes down and your heal is out of bounds, then it's not a catch 
Yeah he sucks 
Yeah he’s no joke. The Red Sox post about it every offseason. This is his first real tournament 
Yeah he's the one who sat in the common room playing smash while you got high and stole my cereal
Yeah I am bummed about the interviews. I am happy about everything else
Yeah I am just reading about that now 
Yeah I am not paying $225/person for a table
Yeah I am not ruining your dinner plans. Either they tell me they can fit 9 or I don't come. Those are the only two options on the table
Yeah I am not ruining your dinner plans. Either they tell me they can fit 9 or I don't come. Those are the only two options on the table 
Yeah I bet you love how he touches you around your rim 
Yeah I bet you'd want him to get on your ass
Yeah I can think of a few who did that. In eight grade, one announced to the class she blew a dude (who was also in our class) at the movies over the weekend. That movie theater happens to be in revere. What a coincidence...
Yeah I figured that out when I googled it 
Yeah I had never heard of it before reading that post
Yeah I have a test 
Yeah I have had it for months 
Yeah I have no idea where she got that part from 
Yeah I haven't watched a single Bruins game this year. From what I hear on the Twittersphere, they are underperforming. My dad (who works at the garden) says that they can't score at home and goaltending hasn't been great. Our backup goalies have been hurt and rotating though and unreliable. We don't have a good defense and the team is overall disappointed 
Yeah I just noticed that 
Yeah I just opened up to the groupme and saw that picture but didn't look up to see that the jlaw gif had been posted. I retract my "uncalled for" 
Yeah I just read it. Didn't think of it until then
Yeah I kind of do agree with joe on that. I feel like there should be some sort of way to track that 
Yeah I know who he is and all that jazz. I could have told you 20 years ago that he's probably boning women left and right. 
Yeah I love how much she shits on marc
Yeah I mean, it's a pretty old movie 
Yeah I noticed that. It should hopefully update 
Yeah I noticed. Dumb joe not starting him over Alex smith. 
Yeah I recognize the end of it
Yeah I sent that while it was 4-1
Yeah I should clarify. It's her house house. Like where her family lives. They're totally cool with us drinking and shit (no weed) but they live their with their grandparents, so things can't get as out of control as they can in someone's airbnb or rental house 
Yeah I think Kevin had him first. Then I bid five bucks on him before you but I needed to drop him and I figured I could get him back as a free agent but you picked him up 
Yeah I think so too 
Yeah I think so. I've never really thought about getting down it
Yeah I think they just reduced his knee on the field
Yeah I thought the same thing 
Yeah I was at work all day 
Yeah I was confused because this says TSA but a lot of what I was finding on a Google search was about IRAs
Yeah I was hoping no one would notice 
Yeah I was just about to say dean blandino confirmed it was right 
Yeah I was just about to say that I realized two of those senators are out of office
Yeah I would just make my own coffee at home if I didn't get it for free every day. A $6 starbucks drink is mindblowing to me
Yeah I wouldn’t say that my apartment in Astoria is on Long Island if I was talking to someone
Yeah I wouldn't think requiring companies to give the virus would fly
Yeah IDIOT 
Yeah I'll get batteries soon 
Yeah I'm doing my best to do that. I haven't been 100% faithful 
Yeah I'm going out to eat with Olivia and my family tonight. I have exams this week so I was thinking of doing something for my birthday next weekend 
Yeah I'm going to be in debt forever. I'm following the Kovin method of living close to school and worrying about debt when I can no longer avoid thinking about it 
Yeah I'm good. I have an abscess on my arm and one on my finger that literally just popped up within the last day. I was hoping I'd just get antibiotics and sent on my way but they want to drain it 
Yeah I'm noticing that. I guess I should have known considering how popular it is
Yeah I'm quite confused why Delanie walker doesn't have 30 points by now 
Yeah I'm seeing mostly dumbass shit. I saw the breast cancer one. I saw the vibrator one. I didn't see the rape one 
Yeah in a way. But I really don't hate manning the same way I hate watt. I hate manning because he's been our arch rival throughout my entire childhood. I hate him but I love him because Brady vs manning is in my opinion the ultimate matchup. I don't like the manning commercials, especially now that he sucks, but at least he comes out and performs against Brady. Watt has never had success against the pats, so I don't see a rivalry 
Yeah it has been really fucking annoying 
Yeah it looked like that one was a block in the back too. They spent 9 minutes reviewing this play to determine they were legal 
Yeah it says PEDs AND drugs of abuse
Yeah it was pretty great. Has a roof deck too. Laundry in unit. Two huge bedrooms, two full bathrooms, lots of closet space. Comes with garage parking. It's only on the market because the current tenants may murder each other any day now and the landlord is essentially kicking them out subject to finding a new tenant 
Yeah it was very interesting. I wasn't aware of the revenue sources for the EPL
Yeah it's in two days. I was supposed to ask a couple weeks ago and completely forgot. 
Yeah it's right here 
Yeah I've only accidentally don't that two or three times
Yeah Jay definitely has better snow. I guess the water park gives value but not 100m value 
Yeah Jeff you fucking douche. Lose with class. Stop being salty 
Yeah Joe, come on. He owns two pairs 
Yeah Joe, I have to screens at home, only one at work. More screens = more production for sure 
Yeah Joe, what an IDIOT 
Yeah Jordan, stop trying to shame Emyr for being a martyr and taking Goody's unbelievably stacked team from him. Check your privilege. 
Yeah Jordan, watch more Pats football. You might learn something. 
Yeah just look at Jawaan Taylor
Yeah Kevin. Why didn't you trade me marshawn for Allen and cash. 
Yeah Kristen graduated last year 
Yeah like three times lol
Yeah lots of smoke behind this 
Yeah man, I am not going to argue with you anymore. Think whatever you want.
Yeah man, just keep waiting up for me
Yeah man. 2 weeks. Fucking lit
Yeah maybe the game doesn't sell out, but at least their not letting other programs gain national attention while alumni sits 2/3rds empty 
Yeah me too
Yeah my comment was because a&m got ranked over Washington 
Yeah my scoring list was way off anyway 
Yeah none of us are going to be jealous of that trip 
Yeah not coming back
Yeah not her. Sorry everyone. I fucked up
Yeah not quite that much 
Yeah not sure if he is as good as Nix and Drake 
Yeah okay 
Yeah okay 
Yeah once she said "we want zero police," it was pretty over
Yeah people with diets that restrict delicious food suck. We should kill them all 
Yeah pretty good evidence that schools are not the issue. I would very much like to see teachers vaccinated close to the front
Yeah pretty much 
Yeah pretty sure Bernie posts articles from them all the time on his Twitter
Yeah required clinical rotations all have shelf exams after
Yeah right. Fuck that 
Yeah Ryan, fucking idiot 
Yeah S town was a real let down
Yeah see, it doesn't excite me to watch amateur players make amateur mistakes to end the biggest game of the season thus far 
Yeah she did a direct entry NP program. Essentially the only nursing experience she got was on clinicals
Yeah she's been placed on their isolation unit the last two days
Yeah she's been working as a PCT
Yeah so then they'd fall in neither category. I just see news reports use isolate and quarantine interchangeably when there is an actual distinction in the public health world. It was not a knock against you, but no journalists covering the virus have cared to learn what each term means
Yeah so when you search for something on TPB, or a file sharing website, you see Seeders and Leachers. Seeders are people who are actively sharing the file with the Internet, so you will be able to get it quickly and easily. Leachers are people actively downloading the file. If you have too many Leachers and not enough Seeders, your download might be slow 
Yeah sounds like not a great investment
Yeah tell em
Yeah thanks a lot for looking through all that stuff John
Yeah that is not how my testing went any of the times I've done it. We actually had to use saccrine 
Yeah that kid was a fucknutter
Yeah that was the first question of the game. Really set the time 
Yeah that's a pretty shitty no call. Ref was literally right there
Yeah that's including that td 
Yeah that's not what I am saying
Yeah that's true. Was a week later 
Yeah that's what I mean tbh exclusive, just that they didn't want him there. I suppose my choice of words was incorrect 
Yeah that's what I was referencing earlier 
Yeah that's why he's my bestie
Yeah the manager or CEO or whatever his title was stepped down because they were way behind their projections 
Yeah the tapas place. Julian Serrano 
Yeah these are straight boxers, just without the button. Just not sure how to describe it haha. I don't have any zipper issues with the pants I have on now because they're a little big for me, but I do with my better fitting pants 
Yeah they haven't looked sharp. Think pressure is getting to him, timing not there 
Yeah they only have the app for android anyway. Which is why John couldn't find the right one. Also, looking at the spawn rate of NYC versus Boston, the difference is absurd. Boston has like 1/10th the spawn rate (provided that the website is accurate)
Yeah those shouldn't count if they don't count for fantasy 
Yeah trikaidekaphobia is fear of the number 13 I think. The prefix just means Friday in whatever language it's from (Greek, Latin?)
Yeah tufts was my number 2 before my interview and probably my number 1 after 
Yeah two weeks off for Christmas/new year's 
Yeah unfortunately I was locked into the timing of medicine and surgery due to the mph degree. We actually have 4 weeks of mph classes after surgery ends 
Yeah Vince isn't going to get much of what he wants in this market. Although Texans may pay him more because they really want him 
Yeah we guessed San Fran. It was wrong 
Yeah well I think we all agree I should have won today 
Yeah well that was a bad idea to begin with
Yeah well....fuck you. 
Yeah what the fuck?
Yeah yeah I know. No one cares about my other league. 
Yeah yeah yeah tomorrow morning 
Yeah you are for missing it. I was just testing you
Yeah you can only watch the first episode for free on prime 
Yeah you can't see the other bids 
Yeah you Fuckholes suck 
Yeah you fucking idiot. 
Yeah you fucks. Stop making fun of marcus. Looking at you @Boe Jourque 
Yeah you get up early and actually do work unlike the rest of us because you're a senior citizen
Yeah you guys didn't realize that was a troll?.....wow.....idiots.....I totally realized......
Yeah you guys said tomorrow, because I was sad that I couldn't come
Yeah you should definitely catch me one 
Yeah you're all ok. 
Yeah! Wait....
Yeah, 17th through 22nd. We’ll be in Malibu that Monday and Tuesday 
Yeah, a dynasty of sadness
Yeah, all in the same sport. Idiot. 
Yeah, all the people not in the Homeowner Homies GroupMe, if it existed 
Yeah, are you willing to work in rural Alaska making $600k or Boston for $275k
Yeah, Bailey Zappe videos only
Yeah, because our borders currently are open. 
Yeah, because their offense looked phenomenal with Dak this year 
Yeah, but Morcus is also a lawyer. I don't see your point
Yeah, but what about the redskins 
Yeah, but you're wrong
Yeah, can't forget the nipple hole 
Yeah, chapman looks great 
Yeah, come over whene..... I mean, no it's unfortunately not....
Yeah, da fuq is up with that 
Yeah, despite the judge saying that he didn't have a decision on who should win and saying that his job is to drill both parties on their weaknesses in order to make them settle, he seemed to be very pro-America (read: pro-Brady) today 
Yeah, don’t let Bo corrupt Russ
Yeah, don't attribute my smart quotes to Chan 
Yeah, don't speak anymore 
Yeah, don't want Joe to win after he doesn't crisp the skin, puts it back into the oven under the broiler (obviously he doesn't know how to use the broiler), and burns the shit out of it
Yeah, especially with 2 of our 3 top corners out 
Yeah, everything I've learned in my extensive business classes has led me to the same conclusion
Yeah, except being asymptomatic while you are infected increases the likelihood that you'll spread the virus and murder Goody's parents.
Yeah, except that he got vaccinated during the J&J pause
Yeah, from what I've heard, most of the big countries are actually doing their part. Back when this issue first came up, there was a lot of talk that China was ready to overtake the US as the leader in combatting climate change, which is pretty insane in my opinion 
Yeah, fuck Mayo
Yeah, fuck me for not remembering the name of a foreign-themed restaurant 
Yeah, fuck me. I feel so bad about not having a bank account that was so bad that it no longer exists 
Yeah, get a job at a company operating at a loss and firing all of its employees because it’s irrelevant in today’s society 
Yeah, have they not watched the second Pats Rams super bowl? 
Yeah, he got convicted of armed robbery 
Yeah, he sure pitched like he deserved your love today........
Yeah, he was awarded the six one ever 
Yeah, how could he let that pizza just sit there without even taking a bite? 
Yeah, I agree. As Goody texted me, if he has a good coaching career, I could see him getting in as a coach, but not as a player. Wilbon's argument was that he was such a smart player and there are so many people in the hall who have never won a ring, but I don't consider that argument valid 
Yeah, I am not really bent out of shape. Mutual aid happens all the time. It isn't taking sides. If there is a need, departments work together to fill it.
Yeah, I bet you like salty meats 
Yeah, I called you a loser
Yeah, I didn't actually read it. I was trying to encourage arguments 
Yeah, I didn't like it at all but I can't say that that's my type of movie 
Yeah, I don't either. He brings a lot to the defense. Which hasn't looked great. You'd think you'd want to keep the best guys on the team so they don't regress even more 
Yeah, I don't either. If anything it's a complement 
Yeah, I don't see any point in allowing ownership of a weapon that isn't a hunting rifle or a handgun. 
Yeah, I don't think AOC's statement differs from the consensus message of the Defund The Police movement. All she's saying is that the proposed cuts were not actually going to reduce spending on policing activities. 
Yeah, I don't think that justifies domestic violence. 
Yeah, I feel like you can't bar him from running. I just hadn't done enough research on my own to actually know the facts. Like many others, I just saw the headlines 
Yeah, I felt the same way about Elsa in frozen 
Yeah, I got booed
Yeah, I guess @Ass Ketchum steals all your action
Yeah, I just persecute all unpopular sports. 
Yeah, I just started looking at the places in the price range goody had suggested. I won't be able to look at any others until I get home from at at like 6:30
Yeah, I know who Rick Ross is and know he is a rapper but I have no idea what he looks like and couldn't name a song of his. I feel like he's in a lot of songs but I probably couldn't even name one that he's featured in. So no 
Yeah, I literally said he and Darrow were too cool for the rest of us
Yeah, I moved from MA to RI and am still a diehard 9ers fan 
Yeah, I often wonder how much of a problem Cruz would have getting elected because of his strong socially conservative views 
Yeah, I really appreciate Yolanda being in your group picture in front of your mod at the tailgate and me not being in it. 
Yeah, I think despite there being states where it is legal of consent is 16, banging a 16 year old is totally not cool bro.
Yeah, I think issue is the initial investment, which is difficult while having $200k+ in loans, wanting to afford my own house, and wanting to start my family 
Yeah, I think that's the one of the worst narratives in sports. I think people don't like him because he's more animated and showy than other quarterbacks. But I think that's more of a reflection of his personality than his race. But I think that a lot of minority reporters like to push the racism button and because it's an easy way to get clicks 
Yeah, I think you have a very unrealistic view on the drug development process 
Yeah, I think you lose your argument when you start talking about skipping meals 
Yeah, I totally picked Washington 
Yeah, I used to beat Darrow every week
Yeah, I wasted my time walking her home last night. Then her and Tyler were dating like two weeks later 
Yeah, I would be running it 
Yeah, I would have had no idea about any of that. I normally pass over the ESPN nba news that pops up on my Facebook and Twitter (and I actually haven't watched sports center in like 4 months), so a team could have been killed by a rabid walrus and I would have had no idea 
Yeah, I wouldn't expect you guys to be smart enough to understand. 
Yeah, if BB could turn down the weather machine a little bit, that would be nice. 
Yeah, I'm not going to do that 
Yeah, I'm surprised he wasn't snapped in half. He's lucky to be able to walk
Yeah, imagine re-adding him back without consent from the whole GroupMe 
Yeah, it is. Because that's what happened 
Yeah, it keeps saying I'm losing by like 30 points 
Yeah, it was 5
Yeah, it's a fair point. I just caution you on choosing a job based on what you hear, good or bad. But you're smart enough to low that 
Yeah, it's bad decision making 
Yeah, it's been good to see him be a difference maker helping them win games since he was drafted!
Yeah, it's broken 
Yeah, it's fucked up. I had a hard time getting those pictures 
Yeah, Joe can't even get through to them and he's the de facto AD
Yeah, Lions probably aren’t thrilled about their impending coaching hire 
Yeah, little sisters. I'm thinking of the right game 
Yeah, makes real sense to put in the running back who is not as good out of the back field 
Yeah, me. Still don't understand 
Yeah, most volunteers in hospitals still don't clean up shit. Nursing students and PCAs do that
Yeah, no chance I’m reading that 
Yeah, okay. *insert picture of Bocker holding a gun*
Yeah, or like that dude who murdered people in his office in Wakefield that one day. He could have instead chosen to go to Joe Bourque’s house and murder him but instead he decided to throw his life away 
Yeah, pandering for sympathy is my thing. Back off 
Yeah, Phil DiBlasi now rich as fuck from winning the lottery and Phil M is so poor that he had to accept blood money 
Yeah, play by the rules John. Banging six different females until completion within the requisite 24 hour period is way easier than jacking off six times.  
Yeah, plus the aid workers who come to help give them cholera 
Yeah, premeds suck 
Yeah, Ross only has discounted khakis. Definitely doesn't offer the convenience of the big box stores 
Yeah, same. All the article I was reading said was that "Senate leaders proposed new limits on qualified immunity, which if approved would make Massachusetts the second state after Colorado to increase the exposure of police officers to civil lawsuits to ensure they can be held accountable for their action on duty."
Yeah, Secretariat should have one. Bojack Horseman was robbed 
Yeah, see that's pretty amazing because the dude is so tall and pretty much gets tea bagged 
Yeah, she sucks bad 
Yeah, she's now the nurrrs
Yeah, since Kasich is governor, Rubio figures that he has the best shot at beating trump in the state, so he asked all his supporters to vote for Kasich to beat out trump. Probably knowing that if trump doesn't get the necessary delegates, Rubio has a shot at the nomination through a brokered convention 
Yeah, straight out of Pinocchio
Yeah, thanks for the invite 
Yeah, that argument is legitimate. Also, a lot of proposals I have seen talk about using smartphones, which obviously not everyone has.
Yeah, that bitch was crazy 
Yeah, that was a high point of my weekend
Yeah, that was on your end
Yeah, that was the same reaction I had. Totally agree 
Yeah, that’s my bad for thinking Marcus would respond to me immediately after he posted in the groupme 
Yeah, that's 100% a link to Daredorm. Nice try Bocker. 
Yeah, that's an English breakfast 
Yeah, that's why everyone here who lived with me hates me
Yeah, the giants
Yeah, the Patriots might be flawed
Yeah, the Red Sox are obviously the most super of all teams 
Yeah, the UFL
Yeah, then that I'm in agreement with. But I have to say I'm biased. I don't like it most of the time, but in the case of the butt fumble, I loved it 
Yeah, they did that
Yeah, they won't do that 
Yeah, til tomorrow 
Yeah, Verizon can be mentally exhausting 
Yeah, very easy to get Australia on the first guess today 
Yeah, we brought in Jamie, Jordan, and Emyr 
Yeah, well you're mean. 
Yeah, Wentz was a product of pre-draft hype increasing his value.
Yeah, what a FLB. That's why I was going to do joffsavarinomdmph
Yeah, Worcester sucks
Yeah, Xander deserved to go over Holt, but Holt is incredible in the field and Pablo and Hanley are huge liabilities. Shaw is solid at either corner and Holt can basically be plugged in anywhere
Yeah, you 
Yeah, you all suck
Yeah, you can walk off the field, but you don't look as good as he did. Matt Patricia practically jumped on him on the sideline 
Yeah, you deserve to have your tuition taxes. 
Yeah, you lost me there John 
Yeah, you made a typo
Yeah, you're wrong 
Yeah. 
Yeah. "I suck" - @Messi Man 
Yeah. Apparently he's getting criticized for his attitude towards the media and that it's being perceived that he bitched about having to pitch more rehab starts in Pawtucket so the Sox had to rush him back up to the major leagues 
Yeah. Did you not see that me, Nick, and John were going to win? 
Yeah. Fuck Joe Bourque
Yeah. He was healthy by the end of the year 
Yeah. He’s consistently ranked in the top 5 patriots all time 
Yeah. Heard it was fake. Just like Columbine, Sandy Hook, the moon landing, AIDS, and threesomes in Fulton.  
Yeah. His agent fucked him over in free agency. I'm upset he went to the Broncos of all teams but it's because his agent mismanaged the market and they offered him the most money. Can't hate him for taking as much as he could get, after all he was a slot receiver with an unknown lifespan in the NFL due to the hits he took. I'm really sad for how his career in Denver ended and I just want the dude to retire before he's fucked in the head 
Yeah. I thought it was ankle at first but not based on what they treated 
Yeah. I was totally going to stab them 
Yeah. I'll send you my address in Maine 
Yeah. I'm in downtown Portland right now. You wanna meet on commercial at? 
Yeah. In here. Watching on TV and on our phones
Yeah. It was all the same play 
Yeah. It's an attack on America and everything that we stand for
Yeah. It's pretty rough 
Yeah. Myocarditis is a nonspecific term simply meaning inflammation around the heart. Pretty sure he is still dealing with the effects, since he is out for the whole year
Yeah. Not enough ventilators. Not enough beds.
Yeah. Not sure if they plan to continue 
Yeah. Pretty much a hot Cosby of a matchup 
Yeah. She doesn't do much off trail stuff but I think it's related to the fact that she normally skies with me now and I'm bad 
Yeah. Someone 
Yeah. Teddy bridgewater is a beast. Who wants him?
Yeah. That's a real clean play 
Yeah. That's why I could give up my iPhone 
Yeah. The one thing Gregg did that the others didn't was stick his hand in all the pots 
Yeah. They had a conference in Boston. Someone attended the conference sick and then spread it to 70 people in Massachusetts and a bunch of other people from other states who then flew out and possibly exposed hundreds of other people 
Yeah. Vereen is scoring 25 tonight so I come back and just edge out goody 
Yeah. You're out of it 
Yeah..........
Yeah...everyone....

Yes and 69% sure yes
Yes and I think yes?
Yes and no. They put every student up in a shitty hotel. However, shitty hotel does not have a kitchen, fridge, or possibly even microwave (no one could confirm). So I had to get an accommodation from the school to get them to pay for different housing. The dorm I stayed in last year no longer accepts students from Tufts. That dorm was on par with 90 or Vandy. The only place they would pay for me to go is a mansion that was converted into 8 apartment units. There is one bathroom/shower for the whole place, no AC, no dishwasher, one stove from what looks like the 1970s. 
Yes and probably
Yes and yes 
Yes because Clemson would likely also still get in and unc would get bounced in round one 
Yes because if they win, I have to deal with this for at least 4 more games 
Yes because it's basketball which sucks
Yes because it's smart 
Yes because Mahomes gets carries on the goal line
Yes because putting the ball on the 2 yard line is organically creating a football play
Yes because we at least got to watch Kuechly during he spaz years 
Yes Becker
Yes Becker, my season wasn't great. While I started the season 2-6, I also played against two teams that put up less than 125 points during those 8 weeks. And I beat both of those teams. Yes my fantasy season wasn't good, but I also had 200 more points against me at the midway point of the season than anyone else (still lead in points against). I got fucked early and had a great finish to the season, and I'm out of the posa (unlike goody who took two years to get out). I'm fine with how it turned out for me 
Yes but #3 is also gunna win 
Yes but at least it wasn't $25 for Melvin Gordon. Which may arguably be as bad 
Yes but Boston hasn't announced whether it is rejoining the timeline or not. It's like 3 weeks behind the state 
Yes but going to bed. Have fun 
Yes but goody tagged me in his previous post 
Yes but half the GroupMe has listened to the ATN podcast so it was not really a snipe that the GroupMe was in concordance with that pick 
Yes but his receivers suck. The 3rd would be perfect for a flex spot 
Yes but I'll be dead at that point. I don't want to shit myself WHILE I'm dying 
Yes but it sounds like he completely dislocated it 
Yes but it's the first one on the featured search. So I didn't really have to look for it 
Yes but Morcus skims and I have not checked the GroupMe since Joe posted the tweet 
Yes but no track 
Yes but she's a little bit less weird. Just kind of antisocial 
Yes but since Joe cheated this year, this league is illegitimate and therefore the league where I will actually be winning money is the only legit league 
Yes but that's #NotMyNarrative 
Yes but the blue still sucks because it doesn't go anywhere useful 
Yes but the NFL owns the network and should be employing unbiased reporters and analysts to cover all teams. Poor employee performance reflects poor leadership. #GoodyIsAManager? #FreeBrady
Yes but the person defending trump is only defending him by saying he's not TOTALLY unqualified, whereas you're saying that he's probably totally unqualified. It's semantics and it's exactly what this groupme is about 
Yes but this was mo Vaughn when he was actually on the sox. Much leaner than he is now or when he left
Yes but why are you asking about a bombing 
Yes but you forgot one 
Yes but you quit and now you're irrelevant 
Yes but you run the risk of looking like a pussy when you hum a fastball into the dirt or 4 feet over the catcher 
Yes Chan, do a better job of fulfilling your obligation to provide Becker with a video diary of your dinner plans each and every night. 
Yes chan?
Yes Darrow already tagged @The Big Dick Bandit  to try and get him in here to do that but he's too busy racing huskies or some shit
Yes Emyr, thanks for pointing it out. Becker would have never known if @One of Two Undisputed Champions was attending if he did not correct his rsvp 
Yes falcons 
Yes for not handing it off to Cook every play 
Yes good luck @GeoffFacts 
Yes he did. That and the big green egg 
Yes he is 
Yes I accidentally hit return. Fuck you.
Yes I am
Yes I can 
Yes I did 
Yes I did call you out
Yes I did just combine Italian and Spanish. Fuck you 
Yes I did scroll back to Wednesday to try and prove him wrong
Yes I have and its better than yours 
Yes I know that
Yes I know the VP holds the tie break but the majority leader decides what gets voted on in the senate, among other responsibilities. 
Yes I leave reviews on gluten free apps but not usually scathing 
Yes I saw that Emyr was joking about his own comments but I still felt like typing all that out
Yes I think it would have very much helped other areas of the country. I just disagree that it would help the majority of people in the two places they picked.
Yes I understood that @Dr. LT Kelleher  was making fun of us. ]
Yes I will be performing the shocker 
Yes I will now
Yes I wonder why Patterson suddenly became good 
Yes if you're an idiot 
yes it does. You’re an idiot 
Yes it is. Because I did. 
Yes it was
Yes it was. It just hasn’t happened yet 
Yes it's a joke that osha and every hospital in the country mandates... That makes sense
Yes it's to maintain current protections. The question is backwards
Yes it's too bad no one else can talk about Warriors/Kings 
Yes Jeff and Olivia
Yes Joe, we all know. 
Yes Johnson 
Yes Jordan 
Yes Jordan, that sums up my feelings, to the extent that I understand the law and the issues around it 
Yes Jordan, we need you to explain to us what's happening and how we should feel about it. But in no more than 11 words. 
Yes my good friend 
Yes Network 
Yes of course, that game
Yes other Joff, I sure do. But no one wants to come down to visit me to find out about that 
Yes other Joff, the super bowl never playing in cold weather 
Yes panthers 
Yes people outside of Boston don't like Tom Brady....
Yes please 
Yes please 
Yes please. I’m on vacation 
Yes plz do 
Yes right before your 21st birthday 
Yes sick of her, but she's also moving out of town for grad school. Hopefully no red line 
Yes sir
Yes sir 
Yes that is why I am confused
Yes that offsides was very helpful
Yes that's a real peer reviewed article with a real title 
Yes that's an actual problem 
Yes that's grammatically incorrect. Fuck you. 
Yes that's my new #Narrative 
Yes that's what I am saying 
Yes the 54 yard one 
Yes then we all decided it was better and then you unilaterally decided to bring them back and massively fucked up the scoring
Yes they have heaters
Yes this is a special election for a house seat. 
Yes Titans. Also fun fact, he was on the Rams and bengals. Had absolutely no idea 
Yes to all of those 
Yes to Gino. 20
Yes to goody 
Yes to goody but wrong investor 
Yes to Hannah, no to Tippett 
Yes to me 
Yes to the second question 
Yes we all know that @goodybot is autistic and Morcus us artistic
Yes we carpool to Boston so we can both get cleanings on the same day 
Yes we did. ^from google
Yes we know 
Yes we're having a blank slate 
Yes x 2 if we’re talking evenings 
Yes you are 
Yes you are 
Yes you are 
Yes you can find parking on Boylston as long as there is not a game 
Yes you can guess
Yes you go for it and take a sack 
Yes*
Yes, @Dr. LT Kelleher , I read an article that you posted
Yes, @JustFacts✅ 
yes, 15 + 4 +1 = 20
Yes, 2/3rds and 1/3rd would have been an easier breakdown 
Yes, actually. I went to monument Saturday night. Too bad you couldn't come
Yes, and I'd probably fire myself too 
Yes, and I'm saying that the Patriots aren't as worried about the top two guys because if they don't renegotiate by the end of the season, they have ways to keep the players for another year 
Yes, Anthony?
Yes, as long as they hate marcus as much as I do 
Yes, because Joe is paying for me. Otherwise I would go hungry for a week 
Yes, because some people can't just cut ties 👀
Yes, Bocker could be Fultz
Yes, Bocker. I also planned a vacation back in November with the thought that you may possibly be coming to Boston that one specific weekend and I wanted to avoid all possibility of seeing you. 
Yes, but an fcs coaching staff can draw up a play that is legal and works. The colts should at least be able to draw up something legal 
Yes, but I’ve seen some that was packaged in a way that cross contaminated it 
Yes, but it's more of the fact that there is an appropriate retort for every situation 
Yes, but John set the name on his account to Kevin Thompson too. I could see why skimmers like them wouldn't know who is who 
Yes, but only because I googled him when they broke up
Yes, but that was an inadvertent Disney quote
Yes, but the feeling is magnified when it's someone who actually consider to be a close friend
Yes, but they also went with a Chan free wedding model, which is even less fun than a Joff free wedding
Yes, but without the P5 win
Yes, by watching the movie at home after it's released
Yes, Darrow plans to fill all of them 
Yes, Daz has a press conference. Didn’t say anything other than out for the year with a leg injury 
Yes, everyone who is still in wins except you 
Yes, exactly
Yes, except for the dog food
Yes, football is life. Basketball was the official sport of the Nazis 
Yes, he has left the GroupMe for 5 days over $10
Yes, hence the subsequent use of "they" as the pronoun of choice 
Yes, him and Darrow 
Yes, I am aware. Just didn't know how much Jamie paid for Benjamin last year 
Yes, I saw it in real life. Don't need to see some influencer talk about how the view is life-changing 
Yes, I was referring to Steven Jackson, but misspelled his name 
Yes, I'll be right there 
Yes, I'm looking at you Emily our event coordinator who neither coordinated nor created a stress-free event 
Yes, its name is @joffbot
Yes, jerk it baby 
Yes, josh 
Yes, keep will fuller. I'm sure he will have much success with Tom O Brien fired and Brock throwing to him 
Yes, let’s ignore the past information that was available at the time of selecting the FLB and instead refer to the information that is available 1.5 years later to justify our awful decisions
Yes, let's blame Americans for not learning the language of communism.
Yes, let's continue to talk about "professional activities" 
Yes, let's fake a direct snap jet sweep and then get a false start 
Yes, let's trust a business newspaper's opinions on men's summer fashion
Yes, let's try and throw to the OT instead of handing it off from the half yard line 
Yes, make sure you find put anything on your CV that isn’t false
Yes, no one should watch or attend any of these games. The billions of dollars that the NFL makes annually will be severely affected 
Yes, of course they did. Anyone who says that Asians are not massive recipients of racism is wrong. Your point is that Asians were able to claw their way up to be higher income earners, have higher rates of college degrees, because of their will to overcome the racial barriers that were placed in front of them. My point is that racial barriers blocking black people from achieving the same thing are too big to overcome. Both points can be true.

Yesterday 
Yesterday and everyday since inception
Yesterday I had Kristen explain to me the concept of the Milk Bar in Cambridge
Yesterday I opened it up and just listened to it instead of watching, just didn't feel the same
Yesterday there were two answers. The wordle cognoscenti doesn't know if it was a glitch or not. I can tell that at least I had the same word as goody today
Yesterday they had 7 confirmed/rule-outs. Not sure how many today. I think some got discharged yesterday evening and one went to the ICU
Yesterday, I got paid to eat a free lunch here. It was lit. 
Yesterday, Rapaport said something about maybe not missing any time and Schefter said something about missing one to two weeks. 
Yesterday’s single game validated all of my commends about Kyle Williams and Henderson
Yet
Yet another Fuckhole who can photoshop better than Chan
Yet he wants to tax Nick on an extra $58,000 of money that Nick never sees 
Yet he's an infinitely better murdered
Yet it’s still not the most common spoken language in South America 
Yet Mike McCarthy still wants to play Ty Montgomery
Yet my waiting room is still full everyday 🤔
Yet no one shits on Matt Flynn for taking all that money and never having to play
Yet she knows me and booted me twice
Yet somehow, next week Fitzpatrick will throw for 350 yards and jets will rush for 100 and the game will come down to a field goal. As is tradition. 
Yet someone Chan still comes out on top 
Yet they are the best players at their positions that the organization has had
Yet they refuse to play him every day. 
Yet we tried to sneak with 3 yards to gain 
Yet when I posted that in here, no one congratulated her. You're all bad people 
Yet you can't stay up for a Thursday night game when you're on the east coast
Yet you're moving to a city where only one of us is within 45 minutes of you

You 100% got this 
You accidentally a name 
You accidentally a word
You accidentally a word 
You accidentally a word there 
You accidentally a word, jordan 
You act like Edelman isn't a first ballot hall of famer 
You act like it's not going to happen goody. 
You actually said northwest 
You actually skimmed a message you liked. Impressive.
You actually switched from versus to against 
You added Ellington and dropped eifert
You admitted you stopped listening months ago 
You all are horrible people 
You all disgust me
You all lost your chance. Except Chan. Doing what Chan said. 
You all make me sick
You all suck. All the Pokemon that spawn near me are always shit 
You almost murdered me when I didn't help you clean up your lunch today. Seems like it doesn't take much to elicit that feeling 
You almost took the lead right there 
You already admitted to playing with a second individual
You already hit Bocker with a piece of sports related equipment
You already posted that one 
You already said that @goodybot
You already said that @goodybot
You already said that. You listed two of his three favorite things. What's his third?
You already texted me that 
You also are required by law to post a screenshot of your last text exchange with Jenn 
You also can’t watch videos posted in the groupme 
You also didn't eat out of solidarity for me 
You also get a $10 drink 
You also had the Greenberg twins. That alone speaks to how shitty MC was
You also spelled fiancee wrong 
You always have the choice between watching a new bad movie or watching the spongebob movie. 
You and Darrow are the only ones to have paid me. Really shows who is moneyed around here 
You and I were mad at a particular nurse who touted her ability to make positive change in the world, but instead chose to use her skills to provide IV hydration to hungover rich kids 
You and I, the only two people interested in the penn relays, can talk about them freely in the groupme, while everyone else who doesn't care about the penn relays has to still sift through all of the messages 
you and joe can hang out all the time then 
You and the Co's interviewed Payton today 
You and who else?
You and your wife make a billion dollars. You can probably buy an entire street in the Back Bay 
You apparently don't care to hang out with your godson, Darrow, or me 
You are 100% supposed to eat those pods 
You are a better liberal than I am
You are a bleacher creature
You are a cute khaki salesman 
You are a liar and a cheat. 
You are a registered Democrat
You are a skimmer 
You are a vehicle, not a pedestrian. Follow the rules by which all other vehicles abide
You are a waste of space in this clan. You didn't even attack on day 1 
You are all fucking idiots for voting for them for TotF
You are an iguana 
You are better than those five because you tell us about your life and I care about you and what you have to say
You are correct
You are correct 
You are dead to me until you inflict punishment on @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
You are doing this to me 
You are forgetting about Zappe 
You are half Jewish, wear shorts year round, like basketball, and sling a mean homebrew. What else do I need to know?
You are likable
You are literally the worst trivia player in the history of the groupme 
You are making headway on those unread messages
You are making that up
You are negotiating with me now. Am I a terrorist?
You are not @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD 
You are not putting anything into me, or eating anything out of me 
You are not the only wild card in subsequent iterations
You are objectively wrong
You are probably describing another muscle on top of it because the psoas muscle is attached to the iliac crest of your pelvis and travels internally to your femur.
You are required to have health insurance or else you pay an annual tax penalty
You are right and I am incorrect. I’m seeing that the lawsuits I was thinking of were complaints made through the AG, not from the victims themselves 
You are right. We are nothing without you, oh great one.
You are saying "it's ok that he almost died because he walked up to the police in a nonviolent way" 
YOU ARE TERRIBLE
You are the biggest swiftie I know besides myself and Chan. Far more than Morcus 
You are the only one annoyed by this
You are the worst
You are traveling during a quarantine. That makes sense 
You are what you eat
You are wrong
You are 🔥
You are, dickbag
You aren't even a real island 
You aren't staying up to watch the Bears? 
You asked 
You asked jokingly. Darrow asked in a legitimate fashion. John has the personality that would respond to the serious question and not the joking request 
You assisted in the stealing of my stash of double ply toilet paper 
You attend an IVY League school, so according to this NFL agent, yes.
You bang her? 
You bastard, some of us are applying there this year 
You be the judge
You beat be despite me putting up 127...
You being bad and me being bad are independent. One being true doesn't make the other one any more untrue 
You bent the administration over a barrel and now you're complaining about how they treated you?
You bet like $1000 on fantasy football and you think $2 on a lottery ticket makes you an unintelligent person?
YOU BETTER QUIT NOW 
You better stay awake and make love to your wife, or Darrow will 
You block a fucking major highway just to try and get police in trouble for putting your handcuffs on too tightly 
You both take the SAT'a
You bring judgement upon yourself by restricting team name changes. Don't create the policy if you aren't open to the Fuckholes criticizing it.
You burn calories while you blend your toxin-cleansing juice. 
You buy flushable wipes Nicholas
You call that for Mahomes because Roger Goodell bathes in his precum 
You came into the league together. You're responsible for his insubordination 
You can all safely drive down I84 without worrying about getting stuck in Jeremy’s ER. He matched elsewhere 
You can also just give cash 
You can also send your credit card info, then. I run a concierge medicine practice
You can also take the blue line and then the free shuttle from their to the airport. Does not make it convenient
You can and you will

You can buy your stuff back from the pawn broker 
You can call me Johnny Depp because I basically sleep in other people's poop these days 
You can choose your rotations to a certain degree. 
You can clearly see that all those pictures were taken in a Hollywood studio somewhere
You can come be my roommate again any time 
You can come over in 2 weeks too 
You can come sit at our table 
You can congratulate her
You can consent at 16, but you still can't bone anyone under 18 if you're older than 18 
You can direct that question at her boyfriend (whose a cop). Just make sure he doesn't see your groupme avatar. Or we might have another national crisis 
You can easily make the argument that years of supporting QAnon and other conspiracy theories on Twitter, as well as railing against fake election fraud, directly resulted in the brainwashing of thousands of Americans, culminating in the planning of domestic terrorism occident
You can find wieners there 
You can fund it once Kloee sells for a billion 
You can get all the information you need to know about Iceland from watching Eurovision song contest: the story of fire saga

You can get to hand surgery from either Ortho or plastics. Same with spine - Ortho or neurosurg 
You can give 5, Joe can give 7. It's all the same 
You can go ahead and shut the fuck up
You can if they are the ones who are wrong 
You can if you're a radical feminist (not trying to say that Brooke is)
You can ignore the recipe from my grandma's cookbook 
You can imagine that I cared enough about you all to write a long blog post about 
You can imagine what happened for yourself
You can infer the rest as you see fit

You can just say basketball 
You can just say Bocker 
You can just say business person
You can keep it for now. You earned that right 
You can look back at the cardinals championships and be happy 
You can lose weight without eating only chicken and broccoli. You need to expand your culinary palette.
You can make so many oreo balls there
You can make the joke on 2/22, Jordan. At least it will be original for Morcus, Emyr, and Jamie.
You can negotiate your salary from industry-sponsored trials and I believe that you can negotiate either your base salary or % reimbursement from each visit 
You can never tell but he's on the white line, he points to the sideline and yells something, and the ref then blows his whistle 
You can officiate Bocker's wedding 
You can park right out in front of the apartment
You can pick which things you want or you can have the chef decide. I did the latter

You can reapply next year

You can say the same thing about the Dems
You can scan it yourself with Google lens 
You can set an outlook distribution list up, and the recipients will see each email address listed out. Or she's just copying and pasting her recipients from the first email

You can start having a valid opinion again when you un-rage quit the league 
You can talk to the Fuckholes 
You can tell because I use data in the plural
You can tell what things are supposed to line up but I'm still not 100% sure how everything fits
You can thank @JustFacts✅ for blowing up his team and getting trade raped 
You can thank Edelman for it 
You can turn that off, you just choose not to so you can continue to complain about it 
You can use our spot and we will park on the street. Street parking is also free
You can use that $25 you saved from the fantasy football season
You can wear a suit jacket like goody if you want. I’ll probably go polo and jeans 
You can’t claim he was responding to a post in the groupme if the groupme post didn’t happen for over 24 hours. You posting it on other social media platforms doesn’t have anything to do with this groupme because it didn’t happen in the groupme 
You can’t compare that because South Park hasn’t had a series finale 
You can’t keep playing two games on Monday and flipping back and forth between games that start an hour apart and games that start 3 hours apart

You can’t prove that was me 
You can’t tell me that White Mountain, CitySide, El Pelon, and New Balance aren’t dropping 5 mil in NIL for this guy 
You can’t tie me down. I’m a loose cannon 
You can’t, it’s an error. Only happens when Goody directs something at you 
You cannot answer the question because you are not a fool
You can't ask for an evidence based approach with things like indoor dining and then deny the lack of evidence when it's convenient. No data = be conservative 
You can't ask us to come up with the solution and find someone to fund it!
You can't avoid the skull fucking you're going to get just by being nice to me 
You can't be great if you have asthma. Rule of life 
You can't be next if goody was last
You can't choose them goody. I chose them. 
You can't convince me that he was in bounds 
You can't convince me that if Kincaid catches that, JA doesn't learn to run right and run through the defense for a tuddy on the next play 
You can't convince me that Joe hasn't had that paragraph teed up for when he eventually got Covid 
You can't convince me that there is anything worth going to Philly for
You can't convince me that Tom Brady wouldn't have blasted Eli in his dumb face if a sniper rifle was made available to him 
You can't drink them either Marcus 
You can't even call revere "beach" a "beach" 
You can't even recognize voices
You can't even say that bocker has a sharp mind with a straight face
You can't get a negative score!
You can't grammatically be affective 
YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH 
You can't ignore the many to be vocal about a small percentage. You can still be the party that is socially liberal with these policies without making identity politics your whole thing
You can't just take an acronym widely accepted to be Medical Doctor and use it for something else 
You can't just walk in and say you want to help.
You can't justify not going for it on 4th and 1 on their side of the field while trying a fake punt on 4th and 3 on your own 31
You can't keep the name locked away forever
You can't kill what's already dead 
You can't learn to be a better person if you start out perfect like me
You can't let Fitzpatrick start over rosen, right?
You can't let Staley coach the second half, right? 
You can't propose a change to keeper format after the draft. Goody did that and screwed over the whole league 
You can't prove anything 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that 
You can't prove that that blue piece of fabric is a mask
You can't prove that those aren't my stats 
You can't put any mortgages on it because you aren't a homeowner
You can't really do that in medicine. If you stray from policy and something happens, you're fucked and we are shut down. If you follow policy and something happens, you can claim that you followed the policy laid out by governing organizations 
You can't remove me from my own group
You can't run from your past 
You can't say "it would have been a good call if we didn't get a penalty" 
You can't shit on women's sports and the say that you consider a female athlete an American hero. Andrew Jackson literally killed the British and drove out the native Americans so we could make the country great again 
You can't take money out of the equation 
YoU cAnT tAkE pIcTuReS oF uWoRlD
You can't tell me Bernie wouldn't come up with a great conversation. He's going to be high as shit 
You can't tell me that Goodell isn't going to freeze an envelope so JJ picks the right set of numbers for whoever paid Kristen the most 
You can't tell me that there aren't better offensive-minded coaches that could have been hired
You can't travel there because you've impregnated to many of their women 
You can't win if you don't score. You play to score any way you can
You can't win the game if you can't cross your half of the field 
You can't. Bock has your gun
You caught the typo. Good job. You passed the test
You certainly can't just walk into a hospital and see a doctor. You need to be scheduled, be set up through hospital registration, need to get a referral from your pcp, need to have insurance information submitted, etc. you can't just walk into the main lobby of a hospital and ask to be directed to the next available doctor. 
You clearly jinxed me to help Kovin. 
You clearly meant to say "but he's staying in NYC". I know what you meant to say better than you
You clearly wrote over the date on the first shot
You coming back disrupts my #Narrative. Strongly dislike.
You confused the plots of two movies with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson with incredibly similar names? You're a racist and I denounce you. 
You could also live with it if he was mad at you 
You could always ask @Boe Jourque

You could always dress up in your pimp costume. Since that was somehow offensive 
You could always go to jail and then you wouldn’t have to do his or your job 
You could always join the military 
You could always just go buy a ticket with them. I think you'd feel worse for not buying the winning ticket than you would for wasting $2 on a losing ticket 
You could always move back to Boston from Houston
You could always move to a third world country like Italy and practice there. They won't get AI for decades 
You could always say that you don't feel comfortable doing it and then send the patient to Kovin. 
You could always stay at The Polynesian at Disney World 
You could argue that Clinton's campaign made these people come out 
You could ask the lizard people to on your flight back 
You could be like goody and rage quit when you lose 
You could be responsible for the gentrification of Revere. I hear they're next in line after Chelsea
You could definitely carve time out of a trip with da boiz to Las Vegas in order to attend in person. I'm sure everyone would find that to be an incredible experience 
You could donate it to Kars for Kids 
You could find a happy ending Asian massage parlor and have them run out your feet with lotion 
You could get a camelback or a water bottle belt 
You could go to Russia and impregnate all their women (consentual, of course). No way their future soldiers could fight with gigantic noses getting in the way 
You could have at least invited me to go before you just walked out of the apartment without saying bye
You could have been at 135 before the 1 pm games were over 
You could have been there. You just decided that you don't care about the GroupMe. Why didn't you check in after you finished reading before you went to bed?
You could have bought a house that didn't have an HoA fee
You could have burritos which are the same ingredients as the taco but in a different sized tortilla vehicle 
You could have dropped it there 
You could have facilitated his death if you had come. That's on your bruh
You could have have gone to bed here 
You could have just added right now 
You could have just asked me and I would have told you that. Planet Money does podcasts about bitcoin every now and again. I am an expert. 
You could have one of many things, most likely shin splints or possibly even a stress fracture in your fibula. Probably should go see your pcp and get an X-ray just to make sure it's safe to keep running on it 
You could have ulcerative colitis. In fact I am sure that's what you have. Might as well cut your colon out now. 
You could have, you just chose an airline that doesn't give free WiFi and you decided not to pay for the wifi AA offered
You could have, you just chose an airline that doesn't give free WiFi and you decided not to pay for the wifi AA offered 
You could have. You decided not to
You could just say bikers 
You could keep an entire team of all pro players, you'd still find a way to have half of your team on ir by week 5
You could kill all your patients, then your work is done 
You could knock one or two JOs off before you go to bed too. 
You could literally say "sorry I'm busy" 
You could make it if you came to Boston 
You could make it if you stayed in Boston
You could move in with Chan in Houston 
You could murder her parents, chop them up, and then bake them into chili, which you then feed her at your chili con carnival 
You could play easily if you just have one of those days where you just can't miss...everyday
You could potentially say that
You could probably break into that field pretty easily. I am sure there aren't many people to compete against
You could probably call their intake number for a quote
You could probably just sell them here 
You could probably just text him and ask him to come bacl
You could put a deposit down on an apartment in rural Idaho for your brother. That would be a great Christmas gift for them 
You could say that we are all on one side of Mount Washington
You could sell it to Emyr and he could take that girl that took him to the pats game 
You could talk to the actual girls who are also on the ferry 
You could throw the Jags on there if you were high enough 
You couldn't pay me $4000 to fly Delta
You couldn't pay me to fly without precheck 
You CSOMers sure do get your panties in a bunch pretty easily 
You da real MVP
You dawg 
You definitely can't say that Jake Plummer was a failed pick after this headline 
You deleted tinder. We were all afraid that if you heard about something tinder related that you would relapse 
You deserve that if you browse with safari
You dick. I totally just texted that number 
You did
You did ask in this groupme, not at that time. Don’t make me go back and prove you wrong too 
You did that all on your own 
You didn’t even share on the first of the month 
You didn’t fuck my face. You lost because you are a grammar nazi 
You didn’t lie. 
You didn’t prove anything. You didn’t fly over the pacific 
You didn’t respond to my defense proposal 
You didn't "miss something." You skimmed. 
You didn't announce it the groupme though...
You didn't answer my question
You didn't answer the first question 
You didn't attend that one. It was at that stupid taco place 
You didn't break your pinky 
You didn't clarify if it was a man or woman in your first post. Please be specific initially next time. 
You didn't even see him during the reception
You didn't explain your bike injury 
You didn't get my good side 
You didn't get the invite? Shame. Darrow and I did 
You didn't have a helmet tho
You didn't invite me other than a half ass open invite in the groupme 
You didn't just jerk off for stimulation like everyone else?
You didn't let me come 
You didn't make it up. Teams of 3-5
You didn't overtly say it but I'm just going to assume that Joe fucked this girl on the MAs bar. Good looks Joseph. 
You didn't post in the groupme, therefore it's still breaking. Also, fuck you for not telling me 
You didn't post the gif 
You didn't post your email asking for an invite 
You didn't qualify anything about age
You didn't say it in the groupme, doesn't count 
You didn't skim. I haven't posted my opinion. I am 100% Thomas but 0% the rest of his team 
You didn't sort the column by wins 
You didn't use the rite write when you said right 
YOU DIDNT WANT BROCK OSWEILER BUT YOU WANTED ALEX SMITH 
You didn't watch the ending 
You didn't watch the World Series 
You disgust me 
You do it by closing your eyes and skiing down as fast as you can

You gutta spike that...
You gutta stop giving the man chances to disappoint you 
You guys are both arguing why the same candidate probably won't be a good president. You're just fighting over which reason is right 
You guys are fucks 
You guys are really overlooking the Disney market. 
You guys are too predictable 
You guys aren't ignoring goody. You're bad at your jobs 
You guys can go to the lake house and take Bocker/Krosten/Sholbie/Morcus with you and I'll go chill with Frank and Ricky for the night
You guys can keep talking about college football, I'm not trying to get you to stop. I just literally don't care anymore 
You guys don’t seem to realize that #YourNarrative is #NotMyNarrative
You guys ever buy a watermelon that just makes you disappointed
You guys ever have a friend who pretends to be artistic but then you realize he's just using ChatGPT to make all his art?
You guys ever have those days when you have a little bit of cheese and some coffee and your bowels decide it's the rapture? 
You guys ever take a shit so big that your toilet files a restraining order? 
You guys ever think about how Bikini Bottom doesn't have any confirmed cases of Rona?

You guys just don't have the same vision that I do 
You guys just don't see the benefit of a really good system 
You guys know how your life is supposed to flash before your eyes when you die? What if we are all dying right now and just having our life relived through our memories? It just feels like normal speed because time is a construct
You guys need a zoom link?
You guys need to understand sarcasm better 
You guys remember like 3 days ago when @Two Time: Undisputed Champion, MD  said that intern year sucked and that's why he didn't post. And now we are almost through his PGY2 year and he still doesn't post
You guys remember when kovin was cool and would squad up? Now he just comes in to spread lies about post counts
You guys see this shit about my boy Kodiak Black? Apparently didn't show up to his concert last night, a fight broke out because people were pissed, and now there is news that he was arrested at the NY/Canada border for trying to snuggle drugs and guns across

You guys shoulda told me I was ugly enough to scare away a golduck
You guys still care about that dribbleball thing? 
You guys wake up well rested? 
You guys want to move to one of the Scandinavian countries? I heard their the tits
You guys were talking about how much you hate your jobs- I just started listening to some freakonomics podcasts today, and one that I listed to was "The Upside of Quitting". Might be worth a listen 
You guys will be sharing a car for 3-4 hours tonight. 
You guys will have to speak a little louder. It's hard to hear you over the screams of the innocent people you are murdering 
You guys will never believe this but I think that some of the characters in Remember The Titans were racist
You guys would probably be better if you had Kaepernick
You had a total of 3 people with you and you overlapped nicely with Joe. It was never meant to be with Stephen. Too bad for all of us, really 
You had a typo 
You had literally one job 
You had me at "it would've been SICK if you died" 
You had one job Joe. Beat the most unfairly stacked team in the league. Not that hard.

You had the chance to stop at "I know literally no one cares* but you blew it! 
You had the nook. So no 
You had time to go all the way there but couldn't hike rainier. LAME

You hate joe?
You hate to see that

You have 3 minutes to respond, Kovin, before I sit through the next lecture
"You have 7 out of 13
Browns
Jaguars
Chargers
Titans
Lions
Cardinals
Bengals"
You have a credit score 
You have a deal 
You have a gambling problem
You have a great boyfriend who is an American hero. Buy him all the fruity pebbles he wants
You have a job to do
You have a knife, they have organs and blood. What can go wrong?
You have a point there..
You have a right to be safe, unless of course you're a gay man in Chechnya 
You have an L in your name 
You have been known to like Young/Penix
You have been my friend since football season after graduation 
You have blue cross. Blue cross has negotiated with mass general that it will reimburse up to 35% of a colonoscopy. 
You have greatly exceeded your basketball talk quota for the calendar year. Please cease and desist. Don't make me get my lawyer @emyrbot
You have many big dicks 
You have messages directed at you to which you have yet to respond 
You have more confidence than me.
You have more time
You have never supported me
You have no proof of that 
You have no proof that I ever did anything nice

You have no shot then. No chance anyone hires someone who dressed in Elmo-face
You have none 
You have Rawls, so it wouldn't have mattered 
You have STOPPED our txting service for Athlete Joseph Bourque and subscribed to CAT FACTS. Text I Love Boners in my Asshole 2cancel
You have such cool Pokemon, Jordan. Give them to me 
You have the ability to do it 
You have the OROY on your team. And Drake Maye 
You have three more to guess 
You have to assert your authority. Make her do your laundry. Bitches hate laundry. 
You have to enter a lottery to be able to not pay the school to live in a shitty dorm? 
You have to get a job in that department that has its employees work while physically on a train like in the commercials!
You have to have huge balls to beat the Seahawks 
You have to immediately fire dan quinn, right? 
You have to kick the field goal 
You have to kick them out and readd them with a different name 
You have to pay big money to get an exclusive piece of furniture crafted by these supple hands 
You have to pay the Wohl toll to get into the boy's soul.
You have to remember that out of all of them, Katelynn and Maggie are the only ones who make conversation with me in person. Marina, jac, erin, etc don’t even acknowledge my existence 
You have to shame him in here in real time. You can't come in here months later and retroactively shame him. He won't learn
You have to stop. 
You have to wait for my dad to bring it over 
You have too much time on your hands 
You have two Pokemon higher than my top two. And like me, those are you only two >90%. 
You have zero reason to complain this week. Look at my team 
You have*
You haven't been good 
You haven't sent any pictures of JJ. Can only assume that Marcus ate him 
You head over to discord, John. We will be right behind you 
You hear that, grocery stores? Bocker just fucking put you on notice. Don't you dare think about selling him a mealy peach 
You heard it here first 
You heard it here first 
You heathen 
YOU IDIOT
You IDIOT. It obviously doesn't work that way because the microchip connects directly to SkyNet, which is encrypted by the NSA and NWA to maintain government control over the pleebs. Only a true Pokemon master who has caught them all and has a full Pokedex would be able to access vaccine data via mobile device.
You invited a date to one of America's best restaurants and he/she couldn't even show up for a free meal? 
You joke but Olivia originally refused to look at any house that was on fewer than 5 acres 
You just admitted that the two events (being with your girlfriend and muting the groupme) are “correlate,” meaning that one influences the other. Ipso facto, being with your girlfriend causes you to mute the groupme on two occasions in the last two weeks 
You just don't understand because you're never that well liked 
You just had too many lentils 
You just have to be smart enough not to play him, dummy 
You just have to be willing to spend $52 on them to outbid Becker 
You just have to believe 
You just have to push the trade through 
You just insulted Thomas Brady.
You just lack commitment 
You just put KC back in this game 
You just said Bocker was smart. Your argument is immediately invalid. 
You just said fuck you to a dead comedic genius. I hope you sleep at night 
You just said you didn't like half of everything good in this world 
You just want me to examine the fungus on your taint
You just wish you were as good of a fantasy manager as he is 
You just wouldn't understand
You keep saying these things but you provide no evidence
You kick him off and then you play BB22
You knew 2 hours and 12 minutes ago 
You know damn well we don't use facts in here 
You know he's going to explain it now 
You know how your grandparents send you a check for $5 for your birthday and you're like da fuq Gramps, this shit will only get me like a single slurpie. 
You know it's bad when three "medical professionals" (I use that term lightly) are supporting the existence of insurance companies
You know Jamie, I wouldn't think twice if that comment came from anyone else. But from you, that shit cuts deep 
You know that federal distribution of resources is kind of fucked up when MA can't purchase enough equipment from US suppliers so they have to ask their football team to fly a private plane to China to bring back enough masks to provide to the workforce
You know that that isn't T.Will, right?
You know that you do eventually have to pay rent 
You know the group of white guys but not the individual black man. That's pretty racist.
You know Tom Brady lives on the east coast now, right?
You know what else can't be stopped? 
You know what else is warm? A $200 jacket a sweater underneath 
You know what helped popularity? Steroids. Just sayin
You know what isn't brutal? Being friends with my good friend Morcus 
You know what matchup isn’t a thriller? Jordan vs. Emyr because Jordan fucking straight murdered his ass 
You know what that means 
You know what that means @#JustFacts✅
You know what that means....
You know what that means?!
You know what the say, 14-3 lead is the worst lead in football 
You know what they say about the UM stadium
You know what they say. A 3 goal lead is just a two goal lead with an extra goal
You know what they say. If you have two fantasy football managers, you have none. 
You know what this game needs? 
You know what time it is
You know what we don't use enough anymore? Whoopie cushions. Lots of potential laughs that we are just giving up
You know what would be a good punishment? Having to take the SAT II exam in a foreign language that you don't speak 
You know what, I am back on Ryan's side 
You know what? Fuck it. Our economy is already in the tank. Free education for everyone. 
You know what's a great vacation for kids? Teaching them how to hike to the bottom of the Grand canyon by age 6. Or bringing them to the cloud forest to zip line at age 9. Or sharing a bottle of a chianti classico reserva with them in the Tuscan countryside at age 16 while having a farm to table charcuterie board
You know what's bad? The fans who are leaving 
You know what's strange? I woke up today thinking it was Wednesday. But it's not, it's Thursday. Just so weird because no one told me yesterday what day it was so now all my days are messed up.
You know when the organizations says they need to do everything they can to retain frank gore that they aren't headed in the right direction 
You know when you mention the Pelicans in the GroupMe, the convo has gone too far 
You know who would really like the typo trope: Dovin
You know who you are 
You know why that front four isn't scary? The pats have two weeks to scheme around them. Just like Bill and Josh do whenever they go against a good Dline when they have the talent to do it
You know your life is meaningless when Bocker doesn't even want to Skype with you for lunch 
You know, cause he probably is dead 
You know, for the cancer thing 
You know, for the slower people in the Groupme who don't follow basketball as closely as you and I 
You know, I think Maine has some escape rooms too 
You let him QB sneak for a TD earlier. And then you let him do the exact same thing to give up the lead 
You let Morcus talk shit about teachers unions this morning 🤔
You liked my gif of Jack Nicholson 
You liked the basic buddy’s insta post. Did you not read it before you threw it a like? 
You liked the comment Becker 
You likely get a pay raise commensurate with your years of experience
You literally already lost the race 
You literally cannot argue that the patriots aren't one of the best teams in the league 
You literally can't be Cosmo if you don't have a Wanda counterpart 
You literally can't prove that @joffbot
You literally did nothing 
You literally drafted a 🐐
You literally have accomplished nothing in your life. Go back to not applying to grad school and stop riding on the coat tails of the rest our successes 
You literally hugged her after your best man/wedding host toast
You literally just said if all the OOC games were comparable, it doesn't matter because of their inconference schedule. That's hardly putting words in your mouth
You literally may never stop vomiting
You literally murdered them 
You literally posted this yesterday
You live in New York. It has a billion gf restaurants on there 
You live in nyc. Go talk to her family. I hear they work just across the bridge in jersey 
You live on Adolphus Ave and were surprised that your Secret Moses got sent to NYC instead 
You lived in Alabama for a year, Marcus. 15 or 16 should be fine for you 
You lol'd because you took what I said clearly out of context
You look elite 
You look good
You look like Mullens and need to change your name, as I thought Tony was mentioning Josh Dobbs and not Nick Mullens 
You lost to me 
You lost? Delete your account 
You made it back just in time for InternetGate
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL
You make this about you 
You making another child?
You marked yourself on Facebook as interested in running a trail race in stowe 
You matter to me
You may be the most trash human I have ever met
You may have started the groupme, but @The Fucking Man made it what it is today 
You may have, in which case I just missed it #skimmer
You may not know, Marcus, but I am in medical school and that's how we are taught to treat addicts.
You mean an event celebrating the restriction of free trade and open markets?
You mean fish and potatoes? How original 
You mean he's not teaching and inflicting young adults anymore? Thank god. That's a big win for BC 
You mean JJ "Barry Sanders" TAYLOR? 
You mean like @Cousin Greg Guy 
You mean like hustle to first when he puts the ball in play?
You mean like right now?
You mean like saying "masks don't help" and then telling everyone to wear masks?
You mean like the night that Bocker walked in on you sexting with me? 
You mean like with Outlow?
You mean next weekend 
You mean the football player who hasn't played since 2017 because he got a ton of DUIs and beat up a bunch of women?
You mean the Michael brown case?
You mean the world to me
You mean Traitor Danny? 
You mean watching him throw dimes for 93 yard touchdowns?
You mean when the GroupMe was made 12 years ago?
You mean willingly shells out money to help scammers who just happen to be blind
You mean you don't follow an eras tour playlist on Spotify that updates every night with the secret songs of the night?
You mean Zo?
You mean, on the loading dock
You might want to reevaluate your life 
You misled me by saying "there is actually a 4th who has beaten every team except his own but he's retired." I assumed you meant all other choices were not retired
You miss me, don't you Bocker 
You missed 3 of Jordan's posts
You missed a rousing sequence that included BC throws interception, FSU throws interception on next play, three great runs by dillon, false start, no gain, false start, trick play failure, throw into the ground, missed field goal
You missed being there for your good friend Jordan last night
You missed deadspin getting super defensive and getting trolled massively 
You missed Fuckhole dinner. That's more important than work 
You missed out. FIFA might be downsizing their headquarters 
You missed the Patriots 
You missed Underpaid Fellow 
You missed Waddle, IDIOT 
You missed your chance. You could have told me they were gluten free and slowly killed me. Now I know not to eat them 
YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
You must be thinking of @Boe Jourque. I don't partake in the weeds.
You must get lots of peppermint patties 
You must have felt immediately excluded from the conversation
You must have gotten some really great movie quality pictures
You must live a sad life 
You must not have gotten drunk enough to come play games with us
You named him Jeff you idiot 
You need a golf cart girl-esque female in the stands cheering you on
you need a phase III trial if you want to advertise your drug as a drug for anxiety
You need a qb, I am sure this is a reasonable trade offer for you 
You need consent before you go touching or else it's illegal
You need it or JJ needs it 
You need literally two outfits and shorts to sleep in. What's the big deal? 
You need to try harder then
You never believed in us
You never call heads you fucking idiot 
You never even alter the landscape of clothing in that area. Literally just slide out and back in. Definitely less damage than unbuckling and redoing everything 
You never have to apologize for anything Emyr. I was not informed of Connor's attendance. 
You normally spend you fourth year doing rotations in the hospitals and specialty in which you are interested so you gain the most experience and networking opportunities as possible 
You obviosly don't listen because you don't know "Marc with a C"
You obviously did not watch the series as closely as I did to know that she wasn't allowed to leave the Avengers' house in that one movie
You obviously didn’t realize a whole dorm was removed despite being on campus several times 
You obviously didn't watch the first two plays of the game 
You obviously skimmed the titles. None of them were negative comments about Boston sports. They were stupid takes because he’s a terrible reporter 
You of course would not be expected to pay for said meat 
You only had fun because you don’t know how to have fun in other ways 
You only see her fun bags in one scene of episode 2
You owe me that much after promising me lunch and then not delivering 
You physically cannot get the flu from the flu shot 
You pick one column and get everyone in it
YOU picked the bears you idiot
You picked the exact same quarterbacks as joe 
You picked the one who doesn't like Jews 
You picked up a player who had two catches last night doe $51 dollars and spent the rest of your money so you have $9 left in your FAB with 9 weeks left. Not including playoffs. I think that benefits us
You play it safe you probably don't win 
You play on a team coached by jack del rio. That's how you don't have a backup 
You play to win 
You play to win 
You play to win the game, not go up by 3 with 2:36 left, only to lose by 4
You plug it into your tv at home john. It lets you stream whatever is on the tv to your computer if phone anywhere in the world. 
You presumably have been breathing
You probably did, I am just a fuckhole
You probably didn't JUST get Covid. You probably contracted it 2-3 days ago and now are displaying symptoms 
You probably have $430m just in Jew gold that you keep hanging around your neck at all times 
You probably would still improve the Bears passing offense. 
You proved it 
You punished the guy who just wanted to have his work day a little bit less stressful by turning his cube into a tiki hut. I think we all know what kind of business manager you are 
You put up 140 a couple weeks ago. It's doable 
You put your best unit on the field. Defense was miles better than offense all day. 
You quit the league. Your opinion is not valid. 
You read a long form about her
You realize that emyr is the only one who said he wouldn't do it, right?
You realize the tuck rule made it an incomplete pass right Becker?
You really got me there 
You really should put your phone on dark mode
You really think Darrow would father and gender besides an alpha male?
You rejected the last wish of a former member. That's the equivalent of pissing on his grave
You remember what happened the last time the Broncos played the steelers in the playoffs right?! 
You remembered his name so he can't be that repressed in your memory 
You revealed that the the mother had a uterus. That's pretty revealing 
You said "was," meaning you can come join us now 
You said contract negotiation hierarchy. 
You said fuck y'all. 
You said quesadilla but the emoji is clearly a burrito. 
You said stahp
You said you couldn't think of a single time I was right. You meant to say that you couldn't think of a time that I wasn't right 
You said you didn't care if they were smart....
You said your budget was 20-30
You satisfy my needs 
You save tons of money by not paying players
You scared him with your shit talk 
You schedule a colonoscopy and have already hit your deductible. The insurance approves the procedure. If the procedure costs $5000 in time, labor, medicine, and equipment, your insurance will only pay 35% of that and you won't owe anything because you hit your deductible. The hospital lost 65% of the cost of the procedure 
You seem to be in the minority according to the discourse in here 
You seem to really love surprising your son’s first amendment rights 
You send the 10 guys on the field and the video crew taping the Titans sideline 
You set a precedent for saying ambivalent things about me. I expect you to continue that. 
You set the screen. If you don't want to be headbutt, get the fuck out of the way 
You shit on trees, your argument is invalid 
You should all learn to control your drinking problems 
You should apply to Tufts med. Apparently they let any old Bourque in 
You should be able to vote for everyone on the ballot that you think is worthy 
You should be mad about this @Fantasy Baseball Champion 
You should be taking your L, not your F 
You should be used to coming up small
You should be used to that 
You should bring them cupcakes from Crave 
You should buy one for Angela 
You should call the NYMC police and have them do a wellness check 
You should call up Pence. Maybe he will have the guts to do what's right
You should catch me one Kevin 
You should change the pharmacist or nurse that administered the shot. They are supposed to check the expiration date before they give it to you
You should do a better job of picking roommates who prefer the same temperature apartments as you 
You should get a lawyer
You should get tested for celiac
You should get to real used to waiting 
You should go away 
You should go back and read every groupme message you missed. I'm sure you'll know how to play it very well after that 
You should go to Amsterdam @The Big Dick Bandit 
You should go to law school with Marcus. I think you'd make a good defense attorney. Just refuse to accept logic 
You should have finished faster 
You should have launched more missiles during your drill
You should have seen him tongue the whoopie pie he bought today before our meeting. You would have been quite aroused, @The Big Dick Bandit 
You should have seen his compressions. SAD
You should have seen what I did the rest of the trail 
You should have small healthy snacks throughout the day to limit your binging. I normally choose a quart of ice cream or a decadent piece of chocolate cake. 
You should jack off onto the family picture she has on her desk while you stare her in the eyes to assert your dominance 
You should join Kristen's account. She should absolutely not let you join her account.
You should join the military
You should keep looking and play a few rounds when you find it. 
You should know me by now. What did you expect 
You should look at EMC. I hear they're still hiring people to fix all the shit goody fucked up. 
You should make an email for the study. Send an email to barstool explaining the study and ask them to post your study email address so people can email you their answers. You'll get thousands of participants 
You should murder him and see how he likes it
You should open it
You should print that picture and frame it. Put it on your desk. Fool everyone
You should probably avoid being boned by 17 year olds anyway, if you want to stay off the sex offender list
You should probably spend every waking moment with them and not hang out with us after. You know, because family is important 
You should push him off
You should quit 
You should really read and edit your messages before you hit send. 
You should rerun the draft
You should see bocker about that. He's a doctor
You should send your ssn to the entire BCH network. Power move
You should steal their toilet paper. I hear that gets people pretty riled up
You should still lose my number 
You should still wait for me to order. I swear I'm almost there 
You should stop raping him 
You should take the red line. I got from Somerville to Boston in record time 
You should talk to Darrow if you need insurance
You should try Dramamine for that 
You should try treating her with more respect. Kind of like how Jordan treated Pam 
You shouldn’t be afraid to be you. 
You shouldn't be leaving people off of your ballot because you think they are a shoe in to get elected and you want to vote for someone else 
You shouldn't do it before your wedding day - Morcus
You shouldn't need my Internet validation to know that I love you 
You shouldn't watch tv while driving a train 
You shut the hell up 
You shut your whore mouth
You shut your whore mouth Joseph. Conform to the circlejerk
You sick 
You skimmed 
You skinned the GroupMe tho
You sleep, you lose the frog 
You sly bastard
You so smart

You sound like a preteen girl 
You sound like Morcus
You spelled @Channe Frank wrong
You spelled Bocker wrong
You spelled Hi @Skimmer wrong
You spelled JetBlue wrong
You spelled Joff wrong 
You spelled kovin wrong
You spelled Morcus wrong. Lots of typos today
You spelled Nock wrong
You spelled talented and good looking wrong 
You spelled western wrong

You spent this past weekend in LI. Recency bias
You still consider him that? 
You still could have been drunk at 430 pm
You still have a higher projection this week than half the league 
You still have five players to go though
You still have us muted. Isn't it always silent?
You still liked his message despite this terrible skim...
You still suck. 
You stormed the court after a win against a team that got knocked out in the first round of the tournament. Congrats 
You suck 
You suck. 
You sure call 911. Make sure that the paramedics know to bring the big boy stretcher 
You take an immunosuppressant...
You take that back 
You take that back!
You taught me something I didn't know and while I haven't read the article yet, I appreciate you teaching me something
You technically can. Slide up then slide to the right 
You tell me 
You theoretically can change this is a matter of seconds
You think I could get her to pack one for me? 
You think I'd trust someone who works for/with Ross to help me lead a campaign against the greatest threat to humanity since the Forerunners? I had assumed you would quit your job before joining my team 
You think it’s dumb because your #Narrative that all of South America is Spanish is wrong, and you should check your geographical privilege 
You think this only worked once?
You think Tom Brady is landing Giselle during high school?
You to suck like you did the other weeks 
You told bocker about it
You tried dating during a pandemic and you both got covid and died after months on a ventilator in the ICU? 
You truly lived a sheltered life
You trust him to move furniture? 
You used a different face yesterday 
You used a double negative. Lose my number 
You used the word cooler. I don't think that that word is right 
You used to participate in an annual gallon challenge 
You voted for him. Glad you endorsed his fashion sense 
You voted for our current administration, so obviously you support this relationship between the government and flu manufacturers.
You voted for Trump @The Big Dick Bandit 
You wanna go?
You want to go toe to to with me on bird law? 
You wanted teddy badly in the draft. You even sent me a text saying to go fuck myself when I stole him from you. And he's a keep for $12 next year. Sounds like a bargain 
You watched Shelbie lost $500 actually 
You watched the irishman in theaters? Impressive 
You watched the scrubs video 
You went on a weekend. We were there during the week and it was crowded, but actually not terrible 
You went on the tour. They had the pictures of the top 10 on the wall 
You went to a college built on a hill. 
You went to see a Disney movie alone instead of paying attention the championship game where you could win a lot of money? 
You were already booked for mod 24B or wherever that was you played 
You were always my best friend since graduation 
You were always my friend 
You were always my friend after graduation 
You were always my friend with whom I willingly and knowingly shared fruity pebbles
You were always my friend, confirmed. 
You were always my friend. I appreciate you giving me advice to better my social media life 
You were always my roommate
You were always my roommate 
You were always there for me
You were born there, so I have to trust you
You were chopping onions in jersey for dinner and I was admiring your handy work. You thought I was being judgmental but I was just admiring your technique 
You were correct 
You were in Stowe a couple weekends ago 
You were included 
You were just there and didn’t invite me
You were left out of the text thread. Too slow 
You were literally never my roommate.
You were more lovable back then 
You were never my friend. 
You were not there Goody. You came to the Wakefield high field 
You were one of the 8 likes 
You were only at 8:47 pace at 5 miles.
You were ranked last by pro Fuckhole focus last year 
You were the only Fuckhole from Boston who wasn't there 
You were third
You weren’t there for me yesterday 
You weren't getting laid before 
You weren't here before 
You weren't here when we all discussed this in the past
You weren't his roommate
You weren't saying that when he was paying you in pennies 
You weren't there for him when I let him rest his head on my lap after puking all over the trunk of Kristen's car on our way back from NJ. You'll never have the bond that we share 
You weren't there for me to talk patriots last night. You abandoned me in my time of need. You, sir, can go fuck yourself. I'm #teamjoeywhitebread and #teamdarrowball now 
You weren't wrong Jordan, Trump is just very intelligent and outsmarted 538 
You whore 
You will always be my favorite Asian friend 
You will get stabbed or burn on the orange line, but at least your body will make it to its destination. Can't say the same about the red line 
You will never convince me that Joe didn’t come in last in this league 
You will never know 
You will see follow-up photos once the class starts 
You will start with the tiniest of CoC's and ugliest of wenches. Just like all the others 
YOU WILL SUPPORT WHOEVER CATCHES THE BALL ON THE PATS AND WILL ACCEPT IT 
You won the Super Bowl. Get over it 
You won’t
You won't be a 4th year long if you keep tipping over cribs 
You won't be the first that day, I can promise 
You won't be the first that day, I can promise 
You won't even let him get a shot in. This is savagery 
You won't get the last one in the top 5 
You won't have a chance when I best Kevin this week 
You work out every day and eat mostly healthily. You're fine. 
You worked in an office setting at MGH 
You would be internet famous if you fucked stop girl. Which means you'd only be slightly more famous than OAG
You would be okay taking a day off from killing terrorists? Shame
You would be the first person I would leave off of my list
You would be wrong. I did that while you were still sleeping 
You would have been my first invite had I been invited
You would know it wasn't if you didn't skim 
You would like a puff of cream in your mouth 
You would like it thick and juicy
You would like Tim Thomas you conservative cuck
You would rather go to DC to hang out with Bocker and Morcus? Woof.
You would think he might want to get references from a more diverse group of individuals, like my good friend @Chan Chan Yaki 
You wouldn't be in this position if weak commissioner Darrow had actually stuck to his deadline rules 
You wouldn't be saying that after my slide across the dance floor last night 
You wouldn't have that hard of a time convincing me that OnlyFans played the biggest role (out of all contributors) in dismantling the American healthcare system 
You wouldn't have to talk to him in person if he just used the GroupMe
You wouldn't know what that means
You wouldn't want to come to this wedding, it's in New Jersey

You, in fact, are the skimmer.
You, sir, are a skimmer 
You. Have. Got. To. Be. Fucking. Kidding. Me. 
You? Or Auburn football?
You’d be less of an idiot to say “I got duped but I would still do it again because I support trump” than you would claiming you know more than the FBI 
You’d lose your chocolatey glow if you wear Joseph’s skin 
You’ll just become another statistic
You’ll still have your private texts and nightly phone calls
You’re a banger. 
You’re a joke
You’re a marketer. Fix it. 
You’re accusing one of the only other members of #JustFacts✅ of lying. 
You’re allowed to be immature when you’re a top 4 quarterback whose dad took payments for you to play in college 
You’re always looking out for me 
You’re clearly doing it wrong
You’re counted in another category because you were always my friend except when you called me a faggtron
You’re eliminating every source of random chance, which is 50% of what Fantasy is based on 
You’re giving me a lot of credit by assuming that I won’t lose to JBoss this week 
You’re goddamn right that Thomas Edward Brady Jr is the first name on there 
You’re going to make a great department chair some day 
You’re incorrect
You’re just begging me to post worse injuries 
You’re just in the wrong part of Europe 
You’re kidding me 
You’re Madden
You’re my bingo
You’re my boy Patrick Chung. 
You’re not @Skimmer so I wouldn’t marry you. I stay woke, and a gay interracial relationship is the wokest option 
You’re not just a terrorist. You’re a terrorists. The plurality makes it more evil. 
You’re right that doctors shouldn’t prescribe drugs that won’t work. Bad doctors exist though. If you have a persistent patient, they are just going to doctor shop until they find someone to give them a script. You’re targeting patients who don’t know everything about the drug, and you can’t expect doctors to be 100% up to date with all drugs either. Another thing you’re not thinking about is the shear amount of money spent on advertising. Drugs could theoretically cost less if companies spent less money on advertising
You’re right, I can’t tell you that because I’m #JustFacts✅
You’re right, they never made them for him. He loved them so much that he made them himself 
You’re sounding real #JustFalse❌ right now and I’m concerned for you 
You’re taking too long. The answer was being @BC FB is going -1 -13 
You’re team is playing really well 
You’re the only one (besides Chan) who listens to sportscenter speculation 
You’re too touristy 
You’re welcome for that recommendation 
You’re welcome for the 🍆 @#JustFacts✅
You’re worse than Bocker after he wouldn’t run the 5k
You’re worse than Dan Hansus. Stay away from my team 
You’re. Suit up joe
You’ve already clinched. Bench all of your players the next two weeks 
You'd automatically know how to do that safely if you were a homeowner
You'd be as effective as Jed York 
You'd be correct
You'd be robbing some poor terminally ill kid from having his shitty make a wish (decision to meet jj watt = shitty, not the make a wish program) 
You'd have to actually start posting to be able to do that 
You'd have to cover the flight change fee 
You'd have to have spare clothes wherever you went 
You'd have to quit smoking 
You'd have us on the street the minute you signed the paperwork
You'd know the answer yourself if you did not skim....skimmer.
You'd look beautiful no matter what
You'd lose. 
You'd love me more if the Pats were 10-0
You'd never have to worry about that if you just refused to work from the office
You'd think at some point, rich people would stop making burner accounts to defend themselves on social media
You'd think he could afford his own though. I feel like getting her second depreciates her value 
You'd think he had a long distance fiancee or something
You'd think with all his gainz in the stonk market, Goody would own a console/PC that could run Warzone
You'd think with all the time to find new subreddits, Kovin could post more in the GroupMe
You'd think, but they've been cancelled before and survived somehow
You'd win that bet 
You'll be as consistent as @Master Darrowball is with posting daily frogs 
You'll be fine with just bengals d
You'll be lucky if I tell you where our meeting is tomorrow 
You'll be on worse terms if you don't say anything
You'll be randomly assigned the numbers that correspond with the box you choose after everyone picks their square
You'll be severely disappointed having experienced BKB 
You'll be the first one I tell
You'll be the last to know if I ever have a child
You'll be waiting for a while 
You'll be working like 2 blocks away from Kane's donuts. Nice.
You'll enjoy his company in the consolation matchup after Soy Sauce and The Underachievers go ham
You'll have a field day 
You'll have it tomorrow night bby
You'll have to bring the dip too 
You'll have to come to Boston
You'll have to just go back and read the conversation 
You'll have to live until then
You'll have to read to find out ;)
You'll have to somehow get into work before Kay to claim it. Not sure how you're going to make it in before 1:30 pm 
You'll have to wear the lingerie too goody 
You'll know in 4 months after our report is released 
You'll never be able to find me 
You'll never get my dip again
You'll never know 
You'll never win if you quit 
You'll wonder for about 6 more hours
Young 20 something herniated from likely a massive spontaneous bleed and coded on the CT table. Went from coding her to opening someone's chest in the room next door. 
Young? 
Your 
Your $5 is on the way 
Your 7 minutes of hockey was more than I watched this regular season
Your argument is invalid 
Your argument is so stupid, I can't even comprehend it.
Your argument is that the international game pass is cheaper than Sunday Ticket. Your can't just ignore the fact that the student discount makes Sunday Ticket significantly cheaper than international game pass
Your beautiful self. And Emyr 
Your birth was a typo 
Your boss just doesn’t have the bandwidth for humor. 
Your boy finally broke 70 points
Your boy is about to win back to back Melrose Fantasy Football championships 
Your brother and the unborn fetus are both welcome to join for dinner
Your brothers name is more googled than any name I have ever googled 
Your car got broken into?!
Your CoC also has had longer to grow. My CoC was just born 
Your comparison makes no sense. I didn't ask for Brady to throw more touchdowns. I said he should go down in the end zone. 
Your coworker is wrong
Your dad said "nice" and your mom screamed her head off and cried for over an hour? 
Your decision that my endorsement doesn't hold any weight doesn't hold any weight 
Your defense can't stop a broken Mahomes. Agnew let's himself get tackled by the kicker. Then Agnew fumbles like a bitch in the biggest spot of the game 
Your defense is just really fucking good 
Your definition and my definition of cool are very different 
Your definition of better is very different than mine 
Your diarrhea is still present in the urinal on the third floor of my building 
Your did you get a gif of the Travis Scott fortnight concert? 
Your doctor did it wrong. There are ways to do it that are relatively painless
Your dong would probably be just big enough to fit in a single one of those microfolds
Your email
Your estate wins*
Your event began over 2 hours later. 
Your face is hilarious 
Your face is one hell of a bad take 
Your failure set me on a difficult course in life 
Your family hating Seth Moulton is the only reassurance I need that he's the man for this country 
Your fantasy team is doing well too 
Your far more successful fiancee pays for your nice apartment?
Your fault for starting a receiver going against arguably the best defense in the league
Your favorite ex Red Sox player is Shea Hillenbran
Your favorite place in the world
Your friend can send his or her credit card info to my secretary for the bill
Your friendship is like a goldmine everyday 
Your game is ass 
Your gift is literally in a mail room in Manhattan 
"Your girl and mom switch bodies. You have to fuck one of them to switch them back. Who do you fuck?

Your girlfriend is a root vegetable until proven otherwise
Your goal is accomplished. 
Your good friend Joff lectures 3rd year medical students at Brown every year about this exact topic 
Your grandfather might be immortal too 
Your guess was bad. Don't lie to yourself 
Your hair is bad. 
Your hair is much nicer than mine and takes a lot more style/effort to cut
Your hands are also two different colors 
Your heartbeat bothers me. Please stop it 
Your hometown just got a shoutout goody 
Your hospital might have had one of those. They are more expensive though
Your insurance would cover the shot and you can get free condoms from any number of healthcare organizations
Your intra arterial black tar heroin habit is about to take off
Your letterman jacket and I9 will be sent by snail mail tomorrow 
Your letterman jacket should be coming in the mail in a few days or years 
Your life is a typo
Your liver is probably already fucked, goody. Good luck detoxifying all of that poison

Your n of 2 is a real large sample size there. Probably statistically significant 
Your name wasn't on the card. That's weird
Your narrative about my narrative was wrong
Your narrative is stupid and would never be a best seller 
Your new name is Johnny Double. It refers to a fictional character in DC comics. JD is still in play 
Your only option is to quit
Your outcome doesn't matter. Darrow is back as commissioner. If you think he lets you win another game this season, lose my number. 
Your owner (read: LeBron) just fired the GM while he was trying to negotiate a trade for Jimmy butler, too. Who wants to play for that 
Your parents thought the same thing. That’s how they got you 
Your ph level has a 13 of about your tone 
Your phone has a keyboard 
Your plane is going down?
Your point?
Your political rival gets in trouble for possessing classified documents. You make a huge point about how awful this is
Your pp is unstoppable
Your question is obviously a trick because women should have no speaking role in movies 
Your reading comprehension is not good
Your sabotage power has to effect anymore, becker. You locked up the Posa and weren't wrong. 
Your second round QB pick doesn't matter 
Your shift is 8 hours no matter what. You don't pre round. You don't round. You see your patients over the 8 hours. You sign out to the next doctor and then you leave and don't have to think about those patients ever again
Your statement ignores the face that 4/5 times, it doesn't matter who gets the ball first or second in overtime. Getting the ball first does not put you at an advantage to win an overtime game. And you can't argue statistics 
Your statistical analysis would never get published.
Your team got fucked up 
Your tenant 
Your theory that @Gonzaga Basketball 2021 March Madness Champs posts more when @bockbot isn't here is false. He has abandoned us again 
Your tl;dr is too long
Your trade was bad, so Jordan is blaming you for his trade.
Your transgression is far more egregious 
Your turn Becker 
Your turn becks. Already got one wrong 
Your typo detracts from your insult. 
Your typo is worse
Your vote mattered and it was wrong
Your welcome for my service
Your wife was mean to me, therefore you are off the list.

You're all assholes 
You're all bad people except team #JustFacts✔️

You're also coming from the opposite direction 
You're also going to be hiking through a lot of snow, most likely, on Memorial Day

You're being generous 
You're being incredibly narrow-sighted. There is so much that can go wrong. I am rooting for football to happen but this is literally the worst infectious disease outbreak in our life time. To chalk it up to "3 weeks on the bench" is naive and dangerous.
You're better than I expected
You're both FLBs
You're clan leader now 
You're clearly not a catch 
You're comparing two completely different things 
You're completely ignoring the fact that one player can infect a whole team/organization, can contaminate a stadium, etc.

You're probably the worst skimmer who has ever walked this Earth 
You're putting all your eggs into the baskets of Fuckholes who spend the least time in the groupme. 
You're really lucky that your deluxe cable package lets you watch so many movies. 
You're refusing to remind yourself to set your lineup 
You're right 
You're right 
You're right goody. That one gif has shown me that Cordarelle Patterson is a huge part of the Vikings offense. Thanks for showing me the light. I'm going to go pick him up 
You're right John. Thought it was just France 
You're right Jordan. The fact that the commissioner has been in here but not pushed the trade through is clearly evidenced that this was planned to get my feathers rustled
You're right, he's a boxer. Which is what the Beatdown is 
You're right, I am so smart
You're right, Pats 20-0
You're right, we should be more like Alabama and use the citadel as our measuring stick for success
You're right. College football sucks 
You're right. Fuck goodwill
You're right. Fuck you, but you're right 
You're right. I should have known better. Men can't be pediatricians
You're right. I stand corrected 
You're right. Joe does look sad. @Kyrie is MY 🏀 FLB it's okay if this career is too hard for you. I can help you get into an easier field, like medicine/being a doctor 
You're right. Not wearing your helmet should never be a joke
You're right. That title probably stays in the Watt family with TJ Watt 
You're right. You can't learn how to fly any plane 
You're ruining the integrity of the game 
You're saying you wake up early because you're a senior citizen
You're seriously risking botulism if you are eating the contents of those cans without an adequate heat source. Plus caves can be home to lots of pathogens. You're better off investing in a bomb shelter of sorts, outfitted with non-perishable foods, running water, and a gas stove.
You're so dumb Bocker. The shit is obviously off the tree by now. We have to find some witness or camera that saw the act. 
You're so fucking good
You're so handsome 
You're something else. ❤️
You're sounding like Lizzo supporters
You're still a better person that that cuntfucker Anthony 
You're still a bitch for quitting 
You're still a flag 
You're still down by 2 points 
You're stuck with Pederson 
You're stupid 
You're such a fine sight to see
You're such an idiot, bocker. They're the same shitty apple headphones without the cord AND they're like $200
You're supporting a far inferior social media company 
You're supposed to fuck after the ceremony
You're supposed to have everything figured out before you meet with community leaders and activists. Then you are supposed to bear the brunt of the criticism when your actions don't line up with their goals
You're supposed to say typo*
You're taking away my leverage 
You're taking over the posa loser's team. What did you expect 
You're talking basketball. So not working. 
You're telling me
You're terrible
You're the awkward one 
You're the best
You're the best 
You're the cancer that's ruining this groupme. 
You're the commissioner...it's your league....
You're the CSOM grab 
You're the guy with the championship belt 
You're the lawyer. You tell us 
You're the nerd, you piece of shit. 
You're the one who started calling me Joff 
You're the only educated one in the groupme 
You're the only one that can be stable
You're the reason Jesus killed himself (this would be a better insult if you were religious) 
You're the tits 
You're the worst overused joke in this GroupMe
You're thinking Jeff Green, the basketball guy 
You're too easy
YOURE UNHINGED
You're uninvited to my "not invited to the wedding" weekend 
You're uninvited to my next wedding 
You're using numbers and I don't know what they mean so I'm gonna go ahead and say you're wrong 
You're using the poll feature in groupme to organize an event, and you're criticizing the rest of us 
You're very cute 
You're very funny 
You're weird 
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome 
You're welcome 
You're welcome 
You're welcome 
You're welcome 
You're welcome 
You're welcome for having to sit through that 
You're welcome for keeping you in the loop 
You're welcome to come over at any time, as long as this is actually what Tony wants to do. I am assuming we are deferring to his desires since he's the one in town for a limited period of time
You're welcome. What do I win from FriendZone 
You're with me in lab every day in spirit 
You're worse than joe 
You're wrong
You're wrong
You're wrong 
You're wrong 
You're wrong anyway Marcus. The real reason he quit was because Jordan and Emyr ripped his heart out
You're*
You're*
You're*
You're*
you're*
You're*
You're* (to me)
You're* yes Jordan I know 
Yours must not have been good
Yours was mean and uncalled for and we aren’t friends for like 15 more seconds
You've already been eliminated for cheating 
You've been a fucking stud today 
You've been dead for a bit 
You've been grinding since 4 am in my books 
You've been incredible 
You've been saying for like 2 years that you were going to get a switch 
You've been to weddings. They play these songs at weddings. Do you even pay attention to life 
You've gotten him hurt a billion times 
You've had some bad luck with shootings less than a mile from your location. I wanted to get as far away as possible 
You've looked very good tonight
You've never come back from that
You've never shared a moment like I have with Ricky. 
You've probably seen it, but I just watched Lethal Weapon for the first time. The series is on Netflix now
You've realized that you're pansexual but Shelbie has agreed to buy you a new all clad set? 
You've. Got. To. Be. Fucking. Kidding. Me.

Yup but not this season previously
Yup come on down. There is nothing we love more than taking care of growth adults with the sniffles at 4 am
Yup I see that now.
Yup I'm reading that now. In the movie it was Cho
Yup lol
Yup that's this weekend 
Yup, and also has a dog. Big plus. 
Yup, and Olivia was born there!
Yup, and then dissecting their levator ani. 
Yup, I'll take that L 
Yup, leaving Sunday 
Yup, sorry old pal 
Yup, thats some grass 
Yup, the Wii, PS3, and 360 all got the normal CoD3. The older consoles got a pile of flaming dog shit instead of a video game
Yup, which is the exact opposite of what you are because you’re my hero 
Yup.
Yup. 
Yup. 
Yup. Almost never log on but I happened to open it today and see that they updated the tracking 
Yup. Although we have had a hard time securing childcare so once her maternity leave ends, she doesn’t have another job lined up yet. 
Yup. And we also have Griff Whalen who people think could return punts 
Yup. As previously discussed, I was going to keep doing it at home for the convenience and cost savings. Plus this was *supposed* to be just a clean up before my rotation starts tomorrow 
Yup. But the attending and resident both told me to go. And apparently they do this frequently with students and our preceptor doesn't actually care 
Yup. But their normal donuts do have flour, they just make gf ones that don't
Yup. Can we sue?
Yup. Can't lose this game without Matthews in 
Yup. Every day of my life. But y'all knew that already 
Yup. For the rest of the season 
Yup. Garbage
Yup. Garrett DiBona, Melrose legend, was a prominent cast member for several years
Yup. Give me that L 
Yup. He's following #MyNarrative
Yup. I definitely enjoy smoke from 3000 miles away in the atmosphere 
Yup. I only heard of Senator Burr because apparently Tucker Carlson went on a rant about how he should be arrested. Who was the other one?
Yup. Just didn’t catch anything 
Yup. Just looked it up 
Yup. Laundry in unit. Heated, locked storage in the basement 
Yup. Like allowing legal sale of organs.
Yup. Looked like a bad call to my expert eyes
Yup. Luckily I do well enough that I am not just barely passing
Yup. Made in Canada. Not very good
Yup. That's how my love affair with him went. He would just keep hurting me until I would leave and then he'd get 160 yards and I'd be sucked right back in
Yup. They'll probably trade a 5th for a 6th and another LT and make it work 
Yup. This was unintentional though. Just got plowed into 
Yup. Tre Jackson wasn't as good this year as he was two years ago when stork was still at fsu. They are hoping he improves being next to stork again going forward 
Yup. Weeks ago 
Yuppies were what the locals like me called the assholes who lived in Southie 
Yuuu
Yuuup
Yuuup. 
Yuuuup
Yvonne's is a speak easy style bar 
YWFMS
Zach Sudfeld was going to be the next best tight end in NFL history 
Zach WiLOLson
Zack and Miri Make a Porno
Zappe can tho
Zappe doesn't need an extension yet 
Zappe led the Pats to more points than either of these teams scored in both of his starts
Zappe should be cut from the Pats, added to an XFL roster, then immediately cut from that team 
Zappe will, however, be breathing down his neck and sleeping with his wife, waiting for Mac to fuck up 
Zappe's most impressive quality is his poise. He's not getting rattled despite a very shaky oline
Zeke
Zeke
Zero
Zero
Zero
Zero chance that Marcus would have taken him out of his lineup if you hadn't said anything 
Zero chance they resign him. Zero. 
Zero fucks given. 
Zero lost fumbles *
Zero times
Zero. Dude won't play injured and he won't even support his team on the sidelines. Loser mentality. 
Zero. I now own the company and just shut it down.
Zimmer is bad coach, despite popular belief.
Zion
Zion is injured again? What a fucking surprise 
Zo
Zoeigh
Zohee
Zolak
Zolak. Gronk (he's going to be injured anyway). Matt Damon. Elton John. 
Zombies were popular 7 years ago. Anyone who keeps up with specifics of potential zombie outbreaks in this day of age is a nerd
Zoom happy hour, not lit

🔥 take alert
🔥 take incoming. Everyone buckle up 
🔥 take warning 
🔥 take. This has been a fun game to watch 
🔥 take: despite his record this year, you can't convince me that Rivers is a good QB 
🔥 take: one nfl game per week should start at 9 am
🔥take. Board exams don't give you the right to treat other people poorly. You're just a bitch
🔥take. Golden Knights fall to last place next season 
🔥take. Soccer games shouldnt end in ties. Group stage games should end in PKs and elimination games should end on golden goal 
🔥take: 11-1 will not happen
🔥take: America is too racist to have basketball be our #1 sport 
🔥take: announcers should abandon the term "skill position players"
🔥take: any commercial with a celebrity cameo has a 96.3% chance of being really bad 
🔥take: be better 
🔥take: bills don’t make the playoffs 
🔥take: Browns are leaking reports that they are taking Trubisky at #1 to try and lower Patriots demands for Jimmy G
🔥take: Epcot is extremely stereotypical of other cultures to the point of offensiveness 
🔥take: Ezekiel Elliott looks like an idiot. 
🔥take: I shouldn’t have to wait until 1pm to watch football 
🔥take: I would rather be a dolphins fan than a falcons fan this season
🔥take: I would rather be a dolphins fan than a falcons fan this season
🔥take: I would rather have Jake Brisket as my backup than Jimmy G
🔥take: Justin Gatlin is a weenie
🔥take: most of the girls I saw in LA were not as attractive as advertised. I think the continuous pool of ugly tourists dilutes the concentration of hot California girls 
🔥take: PFTCommenter and Jerry Thornton are and have always been the only people at Barstool who are respectably funny 
🔥take: SC is bad at rebounding 
🔥take: Sox should intentionally infect Sandoval with whatever illness is going around to get his weight down even more 
🔥take: we win that game if brown doesn’t get hurt 
🔥take2: lebron lobbying for people not to play sports isn't a great look 
🔥takes: Seattle offense sucks; Pete Carroll gets fired before the season is over; Jimmy Graham will never see my starting lineup again unless of course he actually does something this game; Russell Wilson is going to be shopped for first rounder so Seahawks can draft a new stud

🧢ABot congrats to you and Lauren and Jack! Olivia and I are incredibly happy for you guys!
🧢ABot got a fresh re-up of some macoun apples today. Hope you're supplying LC with the goods too
🧢ABot has so many posts because this GroupMe is lame and talks about fake sports all the time
🧢ABot how is my godson? 
🧢ABot I think you made that joke during your best man speech at my wedding 
🧢ABot is that a controversial take? 
🧢ABot loves me
🧢ABot remember that time I pulled a knife in our mod while we danced to Tsunami and almost broke the floor
